0,i used college hunks to move in june of 2016 and i just love them harry and john were so helpful and professional i still remember them 2 years later the prices were competitive but what helped me was that they gave me a quote over the phone after giving them an estimate of how much i had to move rather than coming out to see it that worked much better for my lifestyle my apartment was a little tough to maneuver with my stairs and they were able to get every piece of furniture in no problem i was so nervous but harry and john really put me at ease they were finished unloading my truck in 45 minutes they put everything where i asked them to
1,great for younger kids we love coming here to let the kids wear themselves out the play area is always clean there is an area with tables and chairs that you can bring food or sit with your coffee while your kids play my kids can play here for hours without getting bored as they get older 12 13 i think it may be less appealing for young kids 2 years old or so they can get stuck up in the play area it s not very easy as an adult to rescue them there is always an attendant there though so i m assuming they could help be sure to bring socks but if you forget they have clean ones you can borrow during the day through the week during school is less crowded when school is out and especially on days where the weather isn t nice it can be very crowded we have been there when there was a long wait to get in since it was full overall it s a great place to let the kids play and for the adult to relax
2,this calzone shop offers an array of calzones and sauces on the side to choose from there are enough options to offer variety but not so many that younger overwhelmed the atmosphere is great with several community tables or tables to easily seat larger parties we went at dinner time on a saturday and had no problem finding a seat
3,the food is always great here easy parking whenever we are in the area always go here menu has a good variety
4,very friendly professional and helpful people work here i find a great piece of furniture good quality and in very good shape that didn t break my budget bonus they offer very affordable interior design services as well
5,always have the freshest most delicious donuts in st louis if you are in the area they are definitely worth the trip remember cash for orders under 10 00

7,best chiropractor in philadelphia if you reading this review read no more just schedule an appointment
8,i love mint i ve only ever had good meals here fairly priced delicious food good vegetarian options
9,we had another great lunch at mr b s on 3 12 15 on weekday lunches the special cocktails are 1 50 3 on this visit the bloody mary s and martini s were 1 50 we had a great time stand out entree was the roasted chicken breast stuffed with boudin served on top of sweet potato hash
10,i ve been going here since they were basically a closet behind the hub now being a downtowner it s great to see how she has grown up to suit the locals needs from pet food to pasta to great selection of beer and wine everything is there along with a moderate amount of fresh fruit veggies and herbs anything you need in case you forgot when you were at publix now add in some gourmet chocolates and heat and eat meals that are well beyond your grocery freezer and cooler sections is why this place gets 5 stars if publix is 4 stars this place is a 5
11,hippie hi is the new spot to go to the boba teas are some of the best i ve tried in a long time the new spot is absolutely beautiful great spot to hang out and socialize while enjoying a pita sandwich and tea i definitely recommend and would come here again
12,this place is amazing my friends and i came to nola for the weekend and i was in charge of food this place did not disappoint my friends and i loved it we even ended our trip here and the waitress remembered us
13,i am very pleased to be writing a five star updated review for burger study after my first review i was contacted by management and offered a gift card when the manager who originally offered me the gift card left the restaurant the new management still fulfilled his promise and promptly sent me a gift card for a return visit which we did last month our second experience was far different from the first our burgers were perfectly cooked and not burnt at all this was the exact quality of burger i was expecting from a restaurant associated with st elmo the burgers were flavorful and all the toppings were fresh the presentation is also really impressive like our last trip the potato salad was to die for i tried the homecoming this time and wow was it good the root beer glazed bacon was so thick and the root beer glaze gives it a phenomenally sweet but smoky taste i will definitely get it again next time as far as value goes i will say that burger study is a bit more expensive than its main competitors in town since sides are not included a dinner for two without drinks will cost you around 50 however i do like that it offers a wide variety of burger and side options we will certainly be back
14,i have avoided dental treatments for a decade or two but this year i am getting everything done because i love desert dental the front office ladies are kind and helpful and dr barney is the best he is funny and personable and makes sure that you are as comfortable as possible i had my wisdom teeth taken out the day before thanksgiving and they called me on thanksgiving a holiday to make sure i was doing ok when i did have a minor complication i came straight to the office with no appointment and they helped me almost immediately i can t recommend them enough
15,this was our first experience eating lunch at cheddar s our server was joey we really appreciated that our food was made after we ordered it rather than being prepared hours before joey brought us coffee and my test of an attentive server keep our coffee and water filled up when we were low on coffee instead of warming up our coffee he brought new cups this was typical of the excellent service the food was superb i had a medium rare steak it was actually cooked medium rare which does not always happen the flavor of all our entrees and side orders was very tasty we plan to go back frequently heartily recommended the wait is noted in other reviews and it s because of the quality of food if you want to avoid a line go to a fast food place
16,the noodle was cooked al dente which is a plus i hate over cooked noodles the vegetables was cooked just right i added dumplings to my order there was only one piece i expected at least 2 with the price they charge the pork was well flavored the soup could of been more piping hot i know it s the summer but asian noodle soups are always served piping hot where it ll burn your mouth once you take a sip of the broth the soy sauce egg was delicious
17,we went for lunch over the weekend it was the best lasagna i ve ever had the beer was cold and the service was great we really enjoyed our time there
18,i called and spoke with daniel and he was professional and provided a quote over the phone when i arrived i was greeted by john who was from my hometown the bronx he was professional and gave me a discount i was satisfied with they are great here from work to personality which is difficult to find here or at least i have not found it until coming here i waited a while but due to the staff s company and humor the time went by fast and the car was ready to go i would definitely recommend them for service all the front desk staff are helpful and have great personalities jose worked on the car and did a great job completely satisfied
19,this place needs to be your new lunch spot if you like fresh healthy food look no further delicious omelettes and sandwiches seem to be their staple but their smoothies are a tasty option as well easy parking available with a friendly staff i don t see a reason why you should not stop in
20,i ve gone twice now with my daughter 2 5 y o on saturday mornings while i ve waited an hour both times we ve enjoyed our brunch both times i m still rocking pregnancy but am certain their mimosas and cocktails are great will try post baby my daughter loves their pancakes they are seriously the best with a perfect sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top five stars right there i ve gone with both the omelette and french toast and have loved them both i plan on working down the menu over the course of this year while i m working in the area
21,this is the place we have been searching for my friend and i have tried several nail salons in tampa and nobody could do designs and stuff like how we wanted so we found this place on instagram and we will never go anywhere else again we drive almost an hour to get here but it is so worth it i have had 2 different people who both did exactly what i wanted and are extremely talented thank you pamela and steven you all do amazing work
22,i popped in for a quick lunch with my 5 year old and we knew we were onto something good the moment we walked in and the delicious smell hit our noses the person that took our order was helpful friendly and eager to help us figure out what we d like best we chose our seat among the clean well laid out space the food showed up after not too long we had an order of the wings and loved them the seasoning was perfect and they were exceptionally moist i ordered the chili which came with the best corn bread i ve ever had we got an order of the ribs to go which the rest of the family devoured they are fall off the bone moist and again seasoned perfectly the bbq sauce options were all memorable i look forward to being back with the whole crew
23,the wife and i went down to buy a new bed and ended up spending a whole lot of money it was because of thomas who is a great person and his customer service was out of this world thank you very much
24,stoneyhead brewing is one of the most inconspicuous and even overlooked breweries in our region which is a real shame since there are fantastic and enjoyable brews on tap here that any beer hunter in reno should definitely check out if you have never visited stoneyhead before make sure to ask about a tasting flight on your first visit for no charge you will get small splashes of just about everything they have on tap i really appreciate this sort of customer service as it is a fine way to let newcomers get an idea of what suites their own tastes especially since they don t focus just on one type or style of beer here but instead brew a little bit of everything from pales to porters i tried a few things tonight since it had been a good while since last i passed through their doors if you are looking for something not so heavy i would recommend both the d light and especially the honey pale the latter of which i found utterly delicious and perhaps one of the better light pales i ve had from around our region the irish red is also quite delightful and to which i can eagerly give thumbs up to on the stronger side of things the sneak attack is very enjoyable british ipa which has a nice lightness and sweetness to it much different from the ultra bitter ipas i am accustomed to just watch out as this aptly named beverage will hit you hard if you re not careful some drinks to consider are the mixed beers which are like cocktails made from two of their brews combined together the sneaky redhead sneak attack and the irish red is fun to try but for my money i would go for the honey porter honey pale and their porter which really made a balanced rich and sweet tasting combo there are a couple barrel aged beers i was regrettably not able to get to this evening however there are two very intriguing spiced ipas which i highly encourage any customers to try out the beers are like a paired set one themed for spring and summer the other for fall and winter the summer is a combo wit belgian ipa which tastes surprisingly light and sweet flavored with things like orange peel the autumn in contrast is a brown ipa which is more robust and flavored with spices we normally associate with the colder months and if after enjoying a pint or two you want some beer to go then you can fill up some growlers or buy much of their beers in bottles which are also available in stores around town located in a converted warehouse in an industrial park off south longley know that if you plan on visiting parking can be a little tight as a lot of the spaces are reserved for some of the other businesses in the complex however i think if you are visiting after regular business hours you shouldn t have a problem once you walk in you can snag a place at the bar or at one of any number of tables benches or armchairs strewn about the room service is exceptionally friendly and attentive with a cool upbeat attitude if you need something to munch on while you drink the proprietors generously keep bowls of popcorn and peanuts constantly full on the bar as well as offering a few snacks for sale and having menus for the restaurant just a few buildings away should you want to walk over for dinner there are some bar games present and even a bbq if you want to bring your own stuff to grill up outside i am sorry it has taken me a while to circle back to stoneyhead it most certainly won t be another couple of years until next i stop by for a drink cheers guys
25,the old original owner when it was first open was a prick i love the new staff that took over my favorite thing about this place is they have a bunch of pizzas up front so you aren t stuck with a plain and a pepperoni when your grabbing a quick punch good food nice people
26,my wife treated me to a birthday massage we had the couples massage by kathleen and deanna both therapist were excellent i have a significant case of tech neck thanks to typing psych evals day and night for the last 10 years i was totally relaxed my neck feels better than it has in years the therapists were friendly and we chatted just enough to showcase warm friendly personalities bijou recommended two thumbs way up
27,best wings in nashville i highly recommend the bone in always friendly always lively you ll feel right at home
28,i literally had the best grilled salmon of my life here this place is amazing the food is extremely good my husband had chimichanga and he is also very happy with his food the service was great too i can t recommend this place more
29,this place sells my favourite bubble teas and such in west edmonton mall the line up always looks so intimidating from a distance once you realize that the line always moves quickly it isn t so bad coupled with the wide selection of options i almost welcome the time that it can take to wait i highly recommend the dream bubble tea which is taro and coconut it is my absolute favourite
30,bustling casual brunch spot on the touristy strip of state street with solidly good food their menu includes a make your own hash option a good differentiating element in the sea of typical brunch fare we would definitely go back
31,this was on my list of places to try in 2018 it was fine but i expected more than just fine the drinks were tasty but seemed really tiny the corn dog appetizer was tasty not exactly what i was expecting but good the entrees were good but seemed pricey for the portion and then discovering they come with no sides my fault for assuming but to add a side would definitely take it to too pricey for what it is was really surprised the jambalaya didn t even come with any sort of bread
32,so glad these folks are open again after the fire mudslides my huevos rancheros friend s enchiladas suisas were terrific my husband s chicken tacos not so much dry chicken not very well seasoned the guacamole and chips per usual were fantastic and the service even more cheerful helpful than ever get out support our local businesses
33,lovely people great food received rave reviews from guests excellent service and good planning help being my first time having an event at my home i was particularly interested in everything going smoothly the waitstaff explained what hors d oeuvres were being passed and were very friendly i couldn t have asked for better the manager did a great job too unfortunately the bartender was not familiar with manhattans or old fashioneds which i specifically wanted every time anyone asked for one she had to refer to a recipe or ask how they were made i had requested a specific bartender i had met at another party she was guaranteed to be my bartender but she was replaced by another at the last minute without anyone notifying me she was available but was pulled off at the last minute for another party i was very peeved by this and called the party planner they apologized and tried to make it right for a cost of 2 200 they reimbursed me 80 not exactly wanting my business i guess
34,soy is a korean fusion spot and it s top notch one of my favorite places in the city the food is consistently delicious and the staff is super friendly if you love asian food this place is a must you have to stop in if you want a super authentic korean meal this may not be your spot it s teriyaki and fusion not a old school course meal bim bim bap in the skillet is incredible my favorites are the fried rice dishes they even have a hawaiian fried rice with spam solid this place is worth it enjoy
35,wow i wish we had a place like this in our home town it s probably good that we don t since i d be here every day for lunch the menu has a wide array of sandwiches and wraps and the hot bar was killer the veggie wrap was exceptional and my husband and i enjoyed the french onion soup the market had plenty of eye catching trinkets and home goods great place to dine and shop
36,this place is my favorite place to eat they cooked my steak just how i asked medium rare but more of the rare side the staff was good the only thing is this server sat right across from where i was sitting and felt like he was watching me eat he was trying to watch the game but it was just hovering and kinda awkward but besides that it was amazing
37,if you are downtown this is a must great music food was delicious and staff very friendly we were in nashville 3 days and stopped in each day musicians play acoustic so you can enjoy and still have a conversation check out their 2 for 1 beers during happy hour
38,they have the best sandwiches ever they are fast and every hoagie i have gotten from there is just delicious counter person was very helpful my favorite is the caprastami and italian recommend totally
39,honestly i was disappointed in the food here i ve heard nothing but good things but i wasn t impressed by the food at all i had the fajitas shrimp and steak the steak was super chewy i couldn t even eat it i got so full off of the chips and queso which was yummy that i didn t care took it to go and i tried to re heat it and give it another shot and i ended up feeding the meat to my dogs lol the margaritas were on point tho i can say those were good i don t think i ll be coming back anytime soon tho also the music was so loud in the small lower dining room that my date and i had to move to the bar so we could hear ourself talk also it was hip hop where s the mexican spanish music lol
40,great chicken rice bowl nice guys shrimp also looks good fresh ingredients will return next time i cross broad jarritos is a nice touch
41,every time i m in philly i make a point to stop here for a sub some chicken cutlets their famous ravioli i suggest calling ahead to order because it can be a little bit of a wait sometimes but i promise it s always worth it their italian is out of this world and everything is fresh as could be with a perfectly baked italian bread to complete the wonderful and generous meat assortment
42,i have been looking for excellent sushi in tampa i finally found it after a year i have not even been to the restaurant yet i found kelp sushi on uber eats home delivery food is never as good as what you get at the a actual restaurant the quality of the kelp sushi the presentation the flavor the portions were all absolutely perfect on both occasions the rolls were not made with too much rice most sushi places make the sushi look big by using way too much rice i always use a lot of wasabi and soy i tried part of three different rolls without either soy or wasabi and it was still amazing i cannot wait to sit inside and enjoy this incredible sushi i will not go anywhere else in tampa for sushi from now on this is the one
43,my husband and i decided to try the silverspoon this morning for breakfast i ordered the french toast with berry compote and a side of bacon the french toast was fluffy with a crispy crust it rivaled the french toast i ate in south jersey diners as a kid and the bacon was caramelized to absolute perfection hubby ordered the mushroom bisque to start off with and was very pleased he then ordered the silverberger he is quite picky about his burgers but said midway through this might be the best burger i ve ever had i just had to write a review after our visit today because the food was truly exceptional
44,fun unique and incredibly satisfying sauce on the side is on of my favorite spots in stl and if you haven t been there yet you are missing out for real the pricing is fair the atmosphere is always nice definitely would recommend for a chill and casual spot to eat
45,service is impeccable ate at the bar and larry delivered some of the best service i ve ever had anywhere other servers were great too the food was delicious i went back for my second visit to the city just for the bbq shrimp and it did not disappoint the second time around i also had the gumbo ya ya and pecan pie but the bbq shrimp outshines great experience here definitely plan on enjoying a meal or two here when i m back in nola
46,quaint restaurant to grab a scrumptious breakfast and coffee we will definitely be going back to try lunch or dinner
47,all i can say is wow i made a reservation last minute for 25 people and priya made it happen i came from atlanta to philly and she literally took care of us like family she had the table ready and even got graduation balloons for the graduate they took our huge cake and stored it for us and also put candles on it she brought out the most amazing appetizers and the food was phenomenal we got paneer tikka masala paneer lacha methi mataar spinach kashmiri lamb chicken tikka masala their chili cheese garlic naan is to die for we brought our own beer and her servers stored it and brought more out for people as needed i ve never felt at home more than 16 hours away than as i did that night we left them lots of yummy cake and we cannot wait to go back again if we are ever in the area thank you priya
48,this is my new favorite bakery i am vegan always on the lookout for a good vegan cupcake i found it here i was only able to snap a pic of the leftover wrapper because it was that good vegan chocolate cupcake i will definitely go back
49,the restaurant itself is beautifully crafted and decorated the elegant ambience sets the mood and as a tough critic i love it the food is not rushed and it s delectable taste gave me a memory i will never forget service is fast and server was extremely polite amazing awesome food experience
50,delicious restaurant and the staff is so friendly loved my experience here and hope to be back soon
51,not only was the food delicious but they have a variation of food to choose from apart from that the music was great the family and i enjoyed our time here if you like authentic mexican inspired food with the music to go along with it i m telling you this is the place
52,hankering for south indian dosas this is the place there are good indian restaurant alternatives to this hole in the wall however my taste buds bring me back here it is the only reason for the 4 stars tardiness service are out of left field especially the bathrooms need attention i really can only attest to some of the appetizers and the dosa s and their garlic naan s have always been perfect choose your dosa s and enjoy the food not the surroundings
53,we took the ferry operated by hubbard s marina from ft desoto to egmont key this morning both captains were great deviating both going out and coming back to watch dolphin activity in the area the boat was clean the island is a hidden jewel there are picnic tables and shaded areas to relax as well as beautiful uncrowned beaches seabirds and tortoises abound along with the ruins of ft dade well worth the 20 ticket to take the ferry
54,awesomeeeee place came here with friends at 5 30ish for dinner to beat the crowds the place is so cute and we loved the logo we were seated immediately the waitress was superrrrr friendly and helpful we got the cheese platter called ben s bread spread to split for the appetizer ohmggggg soooo tasty homemade honey and delicious cheeses and the bread was excellent it was out of this world and worth getting my sister and i then split the pizza with the spicy bianca pizza we couldn t even finish it all after that appetizer sooo delicious with the peppers and cheese and thin crust we also couldn t resist getting a whoopie pie and brownie for the road this place is a gem
55,it s always great when you live near a restaurant that serves good food unfortunately i have mixed feelings about bayou bistro i ve had food from here three times during each time it was different my first visit i had a chicken w macaroni the chicken was very very tasty because it was fried to perfection with flaky crispy skin i liked the macaroni as well the second time i ordered there was zucchini on the plate with the macaroni the chicken was nothing like the first time the third time i had beans and chicken the beans had a certain i didn t love again the chicken fell short and was nothing like the first time this shows me the inconsistency of different cooks and how they cook it shouldn t matter if you have 10 different cooks my mom should not be different every time i order from you
56,my friend bought one of the honey lavender cakes for her birthday i had to ask her where she got it since the sliver i had that night was delicious today i went into cake life to get a slice for home it s a clean white shop just how i imagine my future kitchen to be and there were amazing cakes and bars and cookies in the case even nanaimo bars i wish i could have gotten more but i had to stick to the cake slice i d already ordered about half the tables were occupied with people talking and eating it s a neighborhood spot i m so sad yet so glad it s not closer to my house
57,luke s is awesome if your looking for some place that s a bit fancy but still has friendly vibe this is definitely the place i had the shrimp and grits and it was awesome there s a drink named something 75 that ll give you the right amount of tipsy for the meal and the hummingbird cake was worth every bite definitely a bit pricey but it works well for a group of friends or a fun date word to the wise make a reservation
58,excellent food service servers prices i had 100 people at my event and everyone is still talking about how good the food was look no further if you need a caterer
59,such a great local place never get tired of going here never too long of a wait food is sooo good cuban sandwich is my favorite
60,amazing place by far my favorite restaurant in the new orleans area the food is wonderful my favorite is the bbq shrimp and the staff is so friendly great location on the edge of the bayou right next door to jean lafitte swamp tours really fun with a great view of the swamp and occasionally some alligators fun relaxed atmosphere and a really good bar
61,i got the best haircut from kirstin she even took the time to teach me properly blow drying technique and what type of brush to use she also taught me the easiest way to get those messy waves with a curling iron i walked away with a cool trendy haircut and the knowledge on how to keep it looking good
62,calie is the best she s always so sweet and does my nails perfectly she takes her time and goes above and beyond also her sister tracy is really good she s done my sisters nails and mine one time and they looked great if you go there ask for either calie or tracy
63,this is an awesome place service was great and i highly recommend the churrasco hanger steak with a side of crispy brussel sprouts substituted for the fries
64,i m so excited that this spot has opened up just a couple of minutes away from my place i stopped by with friends during soft opening feat an abbreviated menu for a charity event for frankie s friends and was blown away the food is fantastic but the cocktails are the highlight deliciously crafted my favorite was the f 18 i absolutely recommend
65,admittedly i think of take out joints as less than real restaurants in pikpon s defense they do have four tables but it is primarily a take out pikpon has totally obliterated my feelings on take out places their food is excellent not greasy and not salty my fingers did not swell to the size of grapefruits like they do after nearly all other take outs primarily chinese and including pizza places we ordered the chicken and shrimp shu mai steamed tom yum soup chicken pad thai and red curry with tofu nothing let us down the shu mai was simultaneously dense and delicate with a sauce that rivals any other dumpling sauce i ve had the tom yum soup had the most potent of lemongrass giving it an excellent spring like flavor my partner cannot eat spicy food so the chicken pad thai was perfect the noodles were done perfectly and the seasoning was perfect you could really taste the crushed peanuts we will be headed to thailand later this year and i m sure he will order this dish every chance he gets my tofu red curry was just the right level of heat without burning your throat or anything else just a nice spice in your mouth the sauce was not really creamy but nonetheless it could not have tasted any better what was impressive was the firm and browned tofu if i could make tofu like this i d probably make the leap to vegetarian because it was every bit as good if not better than any chicken dish i ve ever had what i also found best was it is not noodle based but bamboo shoots taking their place i remarked to my partner that i could see using these as a vehicle for spaghetti gravy so it was great to have such a tasty dish without the carb overload one of the reasons i consider take out subpar is because the texture changes in the take out containers i m unsure as to why we did not have this problem with pikpon i would say in my case it could be because of the bamboo shoots replacing the noodles but the pad thai had noodles and they did not become altered by the containers thankfully pikpon is local to our residence i can see becoming a regular visit here since the price is quite reasonable for the elevated level of their food i had stopped eating chinese food a while ago mainly for health purposes but i ve missed it now i have a far superior alternative to that
66,love this place old world charm things you don t see every day huge wine and cheese selections bakery to die for wonderful gelato and homemade raviolis pasta sauces meatball mix is great prepared foods wonderful just don t go the day before a holiday because you ll never find s place to park
67,came for lunch and sat outside scenery was awesome and service was good ordered the grouper platter and the fish was dry and tasteless asked for home fries but got french fries my wife ordered a cheeseburger and it was also dry and bland my assumption is the breakfast food is much better
68,super convenient location but be ready for incredibly loud music until about 4 am if you stay on bourbon street obviously this isn t the hotel s fault but the extremely narrow balcony on bourbon street is great spot excellent coffee shop and no complaints about service or quality just need to widen and connect all balconies,the food was good but not great but the service was absolutely awful they really weren t all that busy so it was surprising that our server literally only came over a couple of times during our 90 minute lunch had to walk up to the bar for my second drink and again to get a to go cup in addition we were shocked that they charged us 14 50 for a coffee with 1 shot of bailey s the rest of the prices weren t bad this one just came out of left field they had an apple pie tini listed as their drink special and it was fantastic trust me it s not some dainty drink in a martini glass it s a 16oz glass of straight vanilla cinnamon apple whiskey give it a shot
69,pleasant place great service parking can get difficult but roadside parking with a few parking lots are available came here for restaurant week loved the salads fresh buttery foccacio bread sticks we asked for extras and pizzas cauliflower pizza was our favourite wood fire taste to it delicious loved the deserts devoured them antipasto platter was good first course but they mentioned roasted veggies as part of the dish but only thing roasted was cauliflower there was olives and roasted red pepper seemed out of the can nevertheless very tasty and finished the plate pasta was decent not outstanding
70,i love getting a mani pedi at the salon de belleza i always schedule my appointments with cindy she is wonderful and rose the owner is conscientious to every detail in the salon
71,our party of 6 arrived on a busy sunday afternoon so there was a wait to be seated and a longer wait to get our food we were hungry so any wait seemed too long the food was good and the margarita pizza was very good fresh and made for really good leftovers the quality food saved the day
72,we came here originally to try the frozen yogurt from the self service area or the boba tea but we were intrigued with the rolled ice cream so we got that instead we ordered the cake walk flavor strawberry cheesecake and received an unexpected amount of ice cream for 7 it contained 3 large rolls that was filling for 2 people it comes with whipped cream and the choice to add more toppings they even have an area for vr gaming that we tried out my boyfriend tried a couple games and so did i but warning the vr headset has a smell in it probably from the accumulation of people s head and face sweat we had never played any vr games before and was lost most of the time but the younger boy behind the counter was shouting out tips and instructions which was nice we will be back to try the boba tea and self service frozen yogurt
73,legit i m a huge fan of mexican food and this place tops the charts the chili relleno was to die for i m a texture eater and normally they can be soggy because of the egg wash but this was perfection i got the special combo i believe it was called it had one of everything everything from the relleno the crispy beef taco fluffy tamale to the rice and beans were absolute perfection i m not one to rant and rave about a restaurant doing their job selling good food but this place is definitely an exception give it a shot you won t be disappointed
74,buddy brew is a very trendy coffee shop based in tampa their coffee is flavorful and their presentation is nice i really liked the fact that their lattes and cappuccinos have beautiful latte art on top the store has a beautiful modern design that reminds me of coffee shops in new york this particular location is in hyde park village the benefit is that parking is free the down side is that seating is limited the store is also extremely cold so it is uncomfortable to sit and socialize for very long you may be better off getting your coffee to go and walking around hyde park village instead
75,from the first step you take in the door this place is top notch clean shop really professional and personable barbers this was my first time here and got my hair cut by ish and i have absolutely zero complaints the man knows his stuff and makes sure your cut is perfect i will definitely be back
76,ok my initial disappointment has been somewhat eliviated but the opryland resort is still lacking a world class resort feel perhaps it s the purpose and theme of the hotel there are some really nice amenities especially the shopping the restaurants are somewhat disappointing although many choices it kind of feels like different versions of the same choices pricing is a premium but food is not finally i still don t think the resort understands what is necessary to be world class it s not the property rooms or even the pricing it s the lack of that special sense of being taken care of as a marriott spg property benchmark the phoenician camelback inn or desert ridge in scottsdale to see how it should be done
77,we came here a few times and loved it when our baby was still small enough to keep her in the stroller now that she is a toddler we were looking forward to bringing her here and having her sit in a high chair and eat with us unfortunately they did not have any high chairs and we had to leave we were really disappointed and very surprised bocconcini is a little nicer that a pizza joint but not nice enough where they should be turning away families with small children yelp says they are good for kids don t think so
78,had 42 very good i like being able to add all the sauces to tweak the flavour and add heat we also had spring rolls and salad rolls both yum fast service even though restaurant was full would come again
79,i thought it was so cool having these guys represent me they are on tv and that how i found them they do very well on dui i called they were very nice and had a very professional team its a big law firm but they assign certain people so they get to know you questions concerns anything they would answer promptly and in great detail i would call really late at night and they would still answer i am writing this review because i got off the hook i learned a great lesson but this place is amazing
80,i walked in for a beer it was good but what was better was watching the hostess and manager help a man and his elderly father get back to there hotel it was very hot out and the 90 year old man did not have the energy to make it back to his hotel their hotel was very close but it took them 30 mins just to get to landry s they tried uber and accessing the hotels shuttle but both attempts were unsuccessful the manager than contacted security to bring a wheel chair and gave them few short cuts to help them get back to their hotel that is true humanity and says a lot about what type of establishment landry s is
81,my wife and i were on vacation in nashville and we love historical spots civil war battleground check so this was where the battle of franklin was fought https en wikipedia org wiki battle of franklin 1864 the confederates screwed up and let 20 000 union troops slip past them while they were asleep the union said to the carter house home owner this is our headquarters now they dug in and the south attacked the south had 7 500 casualties and the north had 2 500 the house is still standing with its 1 500 bullet holes still in it great tour and very interesting to hear the history one of the carter boys were actually killed during the battle at his own house,my wife and i were on vacation in tucson and we tried out this new taproom in a strip mall on the way home from tombstone the place is fairly large inside and there was a family in there that brought in a pizza meal and seemed to be enjoying themselves we bellied up to the bar and they have some cool monitors that show their menu and people that have checked in on the untapped beer rating app which i thought was pretty cool i ordered the ipa and the bartender was a pretty young guy who was funny and he and his co worker had a lot of fun banter going on the beer was a solid ipa at 6 a little pricey for beer they make right there but i was pleased with the hoppiness of it i only had one but i have a feeling these guys will do fine just based on their attitude and quality quaffs
82,yesterday was a nice to sit outside very lively crowd out and my macaroni and cheese with grilled chicken was just enough service was a little slow but like i mentioned it was kind of crowded so that was understandable
83,stayed here for one night definitely a place i would return to the staff was great the front desk was very accommodating the atmosphere is very relaxing and still fun
84,great fast service the shawarma was very good we went for a quick dinner the bread was great but could have used some warming up the nap fries were the best staff were friendly
85,we had an early dinner rez at 24 and were seated promptly after a friendly greeting the menu is great with various apps a great selection of pizza and pastas and various mains we loved the scallops entree and pesto pasta the pizzas were good but nothing exceptional we greatly appreciated the service and overall had a great dining experience the drinks selections were great as the wine list wasn t vast but we loved every drink we ordered will be back
86,we were very sad initially to find out that the mushroom bacon benedict and red velvet pancakes aren t on the menu anymore but we went with the biscuits gravy with eggs and the molten chocolate pancakes both were incredible along with our usual breakfast beignets we also had the same server donna jean who might be half the reason we always have a 5 star experience she s exceptional wrapped everything up for us to take home she is super funny personable can t wait to try the other new menu items soon
87,impressive piece of architecture kind of scary that there s no nails and glue holding this thing together but if anything it just makes it a stable structure because it can wobble in the event of an earthquake that s how the forbidden city has survived through the centuries quite fascinating actually it s a free sight seeing stop i wouldn t go out of my way to see it but it is in chinatown and there s plenty to see and do there
88,fabulous food started with the glorious fried zucchini blossoms the gnocchi gorgonzola was rich creamy and cheesy the cannoli shell was nice and crisp such a great experience we will definitely be back for more
89,we hit the buffet for friday night seafood dinner line was reasonable and we were seated probably within ten minutes food i think needs to be kept in context of the price it s not the cosmo buffet but that s also about double the price given similarly priced casino buffets i think it s quite good the brisket and ribs are winners for sure great crust and tender the hot crab was also quite good if anything i d say most food was good quality but underseasoned on the desert side the gelato was icy the cookie got rave reviews from friends and the rest of the pastry was okay but nothing to rave about if you re in downtown reno this buffet is worth a visit but if you re not downtown or don t mind a quick trip the buffet at the atlantis is better and only about 10 more
90,ok this place is kind of an market experience do not expect fine dining you need to go to the opposite side of the oyster crawfish bar and get a ticket yes there s some wait then you go back to the bar and give the ticket to the oyster and or the crawfish dude and they ll work on your ticket if the crawfish isn t ready it takes 30 min for the new batch the oysters are ready whenever the oyster guy gets to your ticket all in all we waited 45 min so worth the wait
91,my wife said the crabcakes were the best ever i had a chicken caesar salad which was very good as well
92,what a fun place it s where everyone in town seemed to be we had dinner and keeli was phenomenal with her perfect recommendations she made it a fabulous food experience we wish were in town longer so that we could come back again don t miss this hit spot see if you can sit on keeli s section because that gal knows the menu so fun
93,star wars drink served with a glow stick if you get another bartender other then the shorter fella with the long slicked back hair who wears rigs on his fingers he s usually there every other bartender sucks
94,easy to find right there in the busy craziness of bourbon street the beignets are delicious the coffee is good this is all i needed and wanted i got it twice during my stay in new orleans the courtyard has nice bistro seating and they bring your food to you after you order at the counter its easy on the travel budget a delicious order of 3 baseball sized fresh beignets w tons of powder sugar is only 3 99 there s always a nice trio jazzy band playing right there in the courtyard as you gobble up some yummy beignets
95,everything we have had has been delicious and service always spectacular as well charcuterie lobster mac burger sliders and a huge chocolate chip cookie all have been great can t wait to try more things
96,this place never disappoints fresh veggies meat sauces noodles or rice the home made bread is addictive so be careful or you ll fill up before your food arrives and don t forget to tip the chef
97,sublime came here on a recommendation from a nola native friend and was not disappointed everything we ordered was incredible and our server gary was excellent great cocktails amazing appetizers tuna tartare hamachi curry marinated shrimp i strongly recommend this restaurant definitely will go back next time i visit new orleans
98,incredibly excited to have this a couple blocks away extensive menu with lots of different options all reasonably priced we were there for lunch on a sunday seated quickly maybe a bit of a wait to order but nothing bad everyone was very friendly and it has a nice atmosphere and outside area i had the lunch taco salad and i was honestly amazing the shell was fantastic crunchy but flakey i ll probably get it every time i go for lunch my fianc got the pollo sabrosos and he said it was really flavorful we need to come back on margarita nights but definitely a place to check out i was surprised by the negative reviews here since it s been getting glowing reviews on the nextdoor site
99,i have used mark wenclewicz for my homeowners and auto insurance for the last five years and could not ask for a better and more customer friendly insurance company mark is extremely personable thorough prompt and informative his office staff are always very courteous and respond to my questions and or messages right away every year he goes over my policies to make sure they are the best deal i could get and he informs me if he finds something better explaining why he would recommend changing companies truthfully this company provides excellent customer service they always take the time answer my questions thoroughly however minor they might seem to those experienced with insurance terms policies and procedures i have never felt like he is pushing me to purchase something i do not need i m not familiar with the agents other than mark but if they are half as good as he is you won t be sorry
100,stay here 1 2 times a year room prices are good many restaurants to choose from relaxing day spa descent fitness facility and large pool area downfall some of the rooms need updated
101,amazing i was so skeptical to spend money on something i could do myself however i was so wrong i could not have cleaned up my gardens as well and quick as they did plus it was super affordable i will definitely use them again and again and again who knew landscaping could be so affordable

105,a typical refined oyster bar with friendly staff well portioned dishes the service however regarding pacing of dishes is off needs refinement as main courses were brought while we we still working on our appetizers then we were expected to make room overall though a good place to perhaps meet friends
106,the food was on point as always but due to how busy this place was still here just paid our check cam was superb he was attentive informative never flinched when we had questions far too often people only post the negatives this was a major positive we ll be back soon and we ll be asking for cam
107,most delicious bison burger and sweet potato fries i have ever had service was great even though i walked in 20 min before closing
108,chicken kabob pita with a side rice hit the spot they re always timely with having orders ready oh and the hummus is really great i d also recommend picking up a smoothie
109,5 minimum on card the frozen yogurt is 51 cents per ounce which can add up if you don t really pay attention to how much you re putting in the cup i like the flavor offerings but they re pretty basic toppings are also limited too but there are candies and fresh fruit plenty of seating and they have cartoon network on a tv set running all the time
110,my favorite bar in all of new orleans neighborhood af and with an awesome well executed cocktail menu homey divey and the bartenders really know their stuff rotating food pop ups outside for your late night drunchies
111,this place is awesome love the food and the workers they always seem to make my day better cachow
112,friendly efficient staff the food was wonderful lots of fresh vegetables are used the noodle beef dish we ordered beef chow fun was not over sauced and the noodles and beef were thin and tender
113,this place is like no other i have found in florida i am originally from new england ri and this place reminds me of home very authentic italian deli restaurant and market if you re a snowbird and missing home don t miss this place the deli sandwiches are outrageous the hot italian is my favorite
114,a ways from the funk zone but probably more worth a visit than anything there it s insanely hip with high ceilings a huge patio and long spacious bar it d be a really fun spot for a large group even more so than fig mountain or topa topa skip the funk zone come here really extensive beer menu plus free pretzels and mustard so there s a cool winery next door too with a semi shared patio area so there s something for everyone bring all your friends and get over to this place asap
115,once i found out about this place and heard that they had cheesecake stuffed snowballs i knew i had to try it sure enough their snowballs are delicious i ve tried the sno la favorite and the oreo cheesecake flavors and i would highly recommend both they are a little bit pricier than most snowball places but it is definitely worth it
116,the food is amazing place is pretty but the staff is unbelievably rude i cant believe this type of customer service is even allowed my suggestion is to order your food and leave becasue you dont want to miss out on their delicious pastry
117,they were so sweet when we came in to get luna s nails clipped and didn t even charge us for our first visit luna can be a bit skittish around new people but she was very comfortable with the ladies we will definitely be going back and recommending them
118,i cant say enough good things about brunch here feels like a home cooked meal in a super relaxed and great environment awesome drinks the bartender siana is so good at her job and she s always smiling i dont know what the managers name was but he was really tall and super friendly he made sure my friends food was free of gluten and personally brought the food to us we will be back
119,i ve made several comments over the several hours following my earlier meal and how good it was if that says anything i had a cuban bowl ropa vieja the meat is pulled with black beans sweet plantains and yucca fries the entire meal was excellent i would definitely go back and i d definitely order that again though a friend s pollo a la plancha smelled amazing so i might try that the plantains were nothing special not bad at all good in fact the yucca fries so good it was like a mix of a french fry and a mozzarella stick it was probably my favorite piece of the meal i would definitely recommend friends to this place
120,great place to grab a quick coffee a snack or lunch with friends can sit inside or outside and i highly recommend
121,delicious walked in late on a saturday night but we were welcomed with as nice smile the atmosphere is nice a bright little restaurant that shows attention to the details now to the food the pork buns are amazing not fried light and super tasty a great starter the unagi sushi was really really good same for the margherita roll the best for the end the ramen is exquisite bold flavors but not greasy or heavy the pork is super tender the ramen at the perfect consistency and the broth simply amazing great to have this little gem in old city ps byob so don t forget your beverages,went back after the first time same great atmosphere and outstanding service this time we tried the chirashi and the hako roll both are outstanding the chirashi gigantic is very tasty the great variety let you try different fish all delicious and for sure you ll not walk out hungry the hako roll a house specialty is incredible i m quite traditional regarding food been half japanese and half italian i grew up with incredible flavours surrounding me and i love the clean traditional flavors but the pairing of strawberries unagy and other incredible fish is so well balance fresh sweet tangy that will blow your mind kudos to tomo s chef

124,we re in town visiting and found the silverspoon through yelp it s a very charming restaurant we came for brunch and we were hesitant because of the limited menu choices we ordered the chicken and waffles the banana bread french toast waffles with chocolate and banana special request a salad and fruit platter all the food was delicious the french toast and the waffles were truly outstanding if you are a local there s no excuse of not trying it
125,justin is the best he s been taking care of my 92 gallon corner tank at home for years now and works on my co2 system at my office as well super responsive and can get livestock plants or anything else you want he s always ready to answer my questions or take care of any problems i have he s my go to guy for all things aquarium and has made my life so much easier i can t imagine him not taking care of my tanks

131,we went to nauti mermaid on a tuesday evening no reservation two people and were seated immediately the space is quaint but really cute the food came out quickly and it was excellent the salmon potatoes and veggies were so tasty i also tried the fish club mmmm i ll definitely be back
132,i love frozen custard but i was tentative about this place b c many people tend to equate rita s custard as frozen custard which is an unforgiveable offense anyways after gawking at the overwhelmingly vast menu i found out that ted drewes has one base flavor vanilla and the other flavors toppings fruits chocolate are mixed in to order i got a strawberry and peach blend and i was very pleased with it the fruit was chunky not just a syrup blended in and natural tasting sadly it was so hot that day the custard was melting fast so i had to eat it fast just meant i wanted more fast
133,we had the white pizza last night and it was excellent this is a great place and a welcome addition to our neighborhood
134,great customer service friendly staff veggie pastas are my favorite in this place and lots of desserts options in the menu
135,first visit today had the chorizo taco and fish taco very happy with both chorizo w their red sauce had my mouth burning for 20 min but oh so delish great service very pleasant we ll be back
136,absolutely spectacular we called for a reservation but they were full house it was recommended we try walking in for the bar seating which is for walk ins there was about a 30 minute wait which is understandable given the wonderful experience our drink order was taken we sat on the patio and received excellent service and attention whike we waited meal was positively delicious service was outstanding so quaint and inviting we made new friends with other patrons will our waiter and bartender was so courteous and warm and made great suggestions we made reservations for our next dinner before we left

138,i have gone to discount tire for all of my tire needs since i became a driver every discount tire i have gone to was a great experience but the one on tanque verde exceeds them all todd the manager and fred were incredible in getting my tires done i called at 5 45pm to schedule an appointment for sometime in the next week i had just bought a new used car and wanted them to check out the tires for me they told me to come on down that evening so they could look at them as expected the tires were going to need to be replaced in the next 5 000 miles or so they did not have an available appointment until the upcoming weekend but still managed to sneak me in the next day during my lunch break i had all 4 tires replaced in less than 30 minutes it was unbelievable thank you todd and fred so much for all the help your staff has excellent customer service keep up the great work
139,a hidden gem indeed if it s your first time don t stray off the beaten path do yourself a favor and go with the classic havana cuban original you won t regret it finish your meal with a cuban espresso for the ultimate cuban experience so much yumminess
140,even after visiting nola this is still some of my absolute favorite cajun food joe is the man and has me coming back time after time for 13 years
141,yum yum yum so many flavors to choose from the best frozen custard in town don t be discouraged by the long lines the people who work there are so efficient that the line goes really fast the only worry i have is that both entrances to the parking lot are right by the stand which makes it pretty dangerous for people who are standing around eating their treats if the entrances are by the far end of the lots that ll be better we always park on the street instead
142,the spanakopita was incredible the hummus and pita was also good i got the steak wrap off of the specials menu and to be honest wasn t a huge fan everything else was good though
143,i loved it that s all there is to it it s one of the best places to go for some of your favorite frozen treats and a long line of friendly faces and that line moves quick so if at the end of the day and after dinner and you want dessert or if you want a frozen treat in the middle of a hot summer day this is the place to go
144,can always count on them for a delicious omelette potatoes are amazing perfect thick cut and golden brown wait staff is friendly as well
145,i really enjoyed my meal here the pierogi were wonderful i loved the scallops with the tangerine butter i m very picky about scallops and these were perfect service was friendly from greeting to table however it was very slow and i waited a long time for drinks to be refreshed etc all in all i d return in a heartbeat
146,the ambience and set up of the place is amazing our waiter was very warm and welcoming i was looking forward to their ramen soup so i had the chicken paiton in mind the soup and appetizer came out so quickly and the presentation was beautiful unfortunately the ramen was way too salty that it was hard to finish i ended up pouring my water into the bowl to help make it salvageable maybe it was this batch bc my sister said it was too salty for her as well
147,stopped by after a trade show with a coworker the food was very good had the crabcake as an appetizer and a very nice bone in ribeye for a main dish needless to say i was not able to finish it but it was delicious and the service was very good walking distance to pretty much anywhere in downtown st louis if in the area i would try it
148,super friendly and helpful staff and be prepared to get dirty as you re provided a bib gloves and scissors to tackle the hot delicious bags of seafood that come out you can choose the type of cooking broth spice level and order seafood by the pound we rounded out our seafood boil with corn sausage small amount of thinly sliced garlic sausage and potato seafood rice a decent amount of shrimp and scallops in buttery rich rice and crispy calamari if you prefer not to have a mountain of seafood carnage on your table you can ask for a bucket to toss it in almost everything is composted so you can feel good getting messy and filling up on seafood only downside is this place is smaaaaaall so they dont take reservations try to pop in during an odd time and you may luck out and get a table without waiting for hours
149,good all american food the brisket was great with crunchy cole slaw my husband enjoyed some craft beers nice bar area indoor or seating and bar outside
150,a stl staple if you visiting town this is a must stop location for frozen custard along route 66 on a hot day it s well worth the wait but evening lines will be easier to bare
151,food was amazing came for breakfast had the shrimp and grits and the southern breakfast shrimp and grits were delicious the coffee is amazing service was excellent
152,i enjoyed the entertainment and the food our waitress was excellent i felt sorry for her she had to walk so far i don t think the restaurant is setup in mind of the servers
153,friendly bakers and very cute treats i would be in big trouble if i lived here their treats are priced well and if you have questions they re more than happy to explain the ingredients we ordered citrus bar gf and everything croissant everything croissant was just perfect a little bit of crunch on exterior but soft on the inside with delicious cream cheese citrus bar was light and refreshing for a dessert bar
154,i m just in love i think this is one of the most magnificent places i ve ever been the quality of everything from the staff to the rooms to the food to the experience this is a magical place and i was so excited about this 3 night stay that i booked another for december with my family i have a destination that i want to visit regularly and it s the gaylord opryland hotel amazing doesn t do it justice
155,nice find near tulane we had three items fried eggrolls pho sirloin and lemongrass bahn mi all were really tasty and i m hard to please when it comes to vietnamese restaurants the portions were rather large and that s not a bad thing the space is well decorated and the service was totally fine
156,this is my go to place for brunch the voodoo crab cakes benedict is out of this world usually you get minimal crab in a crab cake but here the crab meat is ample and the brown butter hollandaise sauce may make you cry the service is great and the bloody mary s are incredible
157,overall i would classify the love as more of like love is a strong word and i had high hopes for the dinner our service was very slow took them 45mins to get our cocktails granted when they finally did they realized they were giving subpar service and comped the drinks so kudos for doing something right the lobster pasta was mediocre at best somewhat fishy and expensive for a tiny portion the trout was delicious and the lamb dishes were decent but nothing amazing i wouldn t rush back talula s is amazing along with so many other steven starr spots this one unfortunately did not impress me
158,we wandered into this venue and were treated to a very enjoyable lunch food was great and not run of the mill service good music good
159,great food great atmosphere a must do for anyone traveling to the french quarter the history is very interesting

165,i am so mad that i did not discover this place earlier in my trip after a disastrous job done at a shop that shall not be named i was referred to buff i got excellent conscientious service from whitney i was sad to learn that she is moving away this summer i was planning to make her my go to every time i visit new orleans she swears however that everyone in the salon is as good as she is and that we both are very picky about our nails
166,i really like the holy shiitake pie although this is a chain resturant the pizza is pretty good and the service is good as well the decor inside is a bit trippy and interesting
167,by far my favorite restaurant in indianapolis we have never had a bad meal there we recently did the chef s 5 course tasting meal with wine pairings and it was excellent we started with the shrimp corn dogs and then followed with a smoked salmon salad foie gras sole venison and then dessert course it was one of the best meals i have had in a long time the staff there was also excellent we had an issue with the weather and our babysitter couldn t make it so we decided to go with our toddler in tow not only did the staff tell us the restaurants was kid friendly and reassure me it was no big deal for our 3 year old to be there but they also went out of their way to make us feel comfortable having him there including doing a magic trick for him and chef even talked to him and gave him some ice cream it just helped us have such a great experience what a wonderful place with the best food in indy we plan to go quarterly for a 5 course meal
168,comfort food at its best huge portions always take home eaten here for years as a tourist my only complaint is the sweet cornbread if i wanted cake i d order it service can be spotty but i go for the food enjoy

179,two and s half stars not a fan of most chains as they are nothing more than controlled mediocrity this location is the same service is painfully slow orders are not accurate and anything sent back again is a wait and wonder if it will ever come out or if everyone will be finished be the time it s finally replaced my recommendation is drive 5 miles down the road and get your pizza from wegmans,head and shoulders above applebee s and classier than hooters typical sports bar grub served by perky college girls
180,a true hole in the wall with authentic middle eastern wraps i love to go to this place i used to go more often about 5 10 years ago but i got the chance to revisit a month or so back boy didn t i miss it i had the mediterranean wrap amazingly well done and cut meat to perfection with all the necessary adds on such as feta grape leaf dolma to make sure all the middle eastern flavors dance in your mouth i enjoyed it so much the portion is perfect not to big not too small you want to top that with a really awesome desert you have to try the pistachio burma god i am coming to you,solid 4 start amazing bread good concept fast and tasty i will go again their bowl is quite filling chicken is very tasty
181,love this farmers market lots of kind vendors that care about their products if you re in stl and like a good farmers market this is a must stop i have too many favorites to list parking can be a bit annoying but it s well worth it
182,my family chose bluewater grill to celebrate our parents birthdays my father and i love lighthouses and found ourselves gravitating to this restaurant despite its heavy tourist location the food was delicious we had the crab artichoke dip mahi mahi tacos grilled octopus with potatoes crab louie salad and a lobster roll dani our waitress was a doll she was patient clear and just lovely i greatly appreciate her kindness and patience to my older parents the crab artichoke dish was hot bubbling and delicious the seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked dani brought a birthday sundae for my parents to enjoy towards the end of the meal everyone who worked at bluewater grill was exceptionally polite thoughtful and welcoming i applaud all the great people working at bluewater grill and look forward to coming again
183,great food great service had a ribeye hey i was hungry for red meat ordered the iceburg wedge upgrade added a couple sam adams summer ale and i left very satisfied cooked perfect tender and well marbled and seasoned
184,great place and atmosphere huge portions you need to be really hungry for only 10 dollars two huge pancakes 4 slices of bacon and 2 large eggs where can you truly go wrong pancakes are very fluffy the bacon is perfect and not fatty they have them all over so don t worry find a location near you
185,i have this new thing where the hubs and i try a restaurant dining establishment we have not tried every other week we are successful sometimes and recently so when we drove into town to try maico i had it bookmarked can t remember why but i know i wanted to try it ordered a few different items all excellent sonoran dog rolled tacos carne asada taco combo plate and a chile relleno burrito the guy in the window where we ordered was incredibly nice and friendly he actually brought us our food it was over 100 out and they have outdoor seating only but they have misters which makes all the difference and we were comfortable the place was very clean food came out delicious and hot we enjoyed it a lot even though i am obsessed with finding the worlds best chilaquiles i have a side project in sampling the worlds chile rellano burritos maico s was impressive give it a try if you find yourself here,so it is a dentist and how excited does one get about the dentist right i am mustering 4 stars but could eventually go 5 after some more visits to start after a recent switch we decided to make in dentists we had been with our last dental office for over ten years but needed a change and landed here based on community reviews and it not being a fast food dentist or chain the office is really lovely the waiting area comfortable there is a play area for kids as well which is nice for people who want to keep the little ones entertained the receptionist was very welcoming super nice and genuine getting us checked in the hygienist that did all the intro stuff and gave me some perio maintenance was very sweet knowledgeable and easy to connect with the dentist came in and did a quick exam he seemed very nice but the jury is still out on him given he didn t actually do any work but so far so good my husband had an appointment at the same time and really liked the staff that he interacted with so we are going back and will hopefully become long term patients of aeris
186,we have come to love king s garden and we order from them all the time and pick up our food ourselves we also enjoy having a meal in the restaurant sometimes highly recommend our top faves the hot and sour soup the house fried rice addictive we order this without pork but it has big shrimp and big pieces of really nice lean chicken in it and the vegetable spring rolls are yummy also the grilled norwegian salmon with black bean sauce is really delicious and unique a lovely family runs this restaurant and the food is very fresh also on the one occasion there was a problem with some watery soup they cheerfully gave me a credit for it toward my next order good customer service is clearly a priority for this establishment thanks king s garden you ve made very loyal customers out of us
187,this gym is cool and is in the middle of channelside downtown you must workout during the day cuz after 500 pm it s crazy busy in there the employees are mostly friendly but not overly friendly i love all the options it has to work out i love the free massage chairs for after my work out parking is a pain and is not very convenient overall i enjoy it and will continue to come to this gym during off hours
188,the staff here is amazing michelle was fantastic and kind to a co worker and me i wish i remembered the cashier s name because he was incredibly friendly too they both delivered world class service my favorite panera ever
189,located at the farmers market in the french market district you basically order at the counter then pick up your food there are a few patio tables chairs where you can dine in as well definitely get the peel and eat boiled crawfish and bbq shrimp freshest crawfish i ve ever had and doesn t have an aftertaste that lingers if you ve never had crawfish make sure you research how to open em up before you try em cause you ll be missing out these crawdaddies are cooked with some vegetables celery and onions and it does have about a 6 10 spice to it so i wouldn t recommend it to those who can t handle spice very well i believe the market price was 12 lb so a bit pricier than other crawfish joints in nola the bbq boiled shrimp was very tasty as well it came with bread drenched in garlic butter my boyfriend and i also shared the crawfish beignets which were okay it felt like they were sitting out for awhile waiting to be picked these crawfish beignets resembles a hush puppy with a few pieces of crawfish tails inside i would probably pass on them next time make sure to order yourself a side of fries too to sorta help fill your tummy up if you re trying out the peel and eat make sure to bring some wet wipes hand sanitizer to use right after restrooms are a bit tricky to locate i believe the closest restroom would be in the flea market area of the french market district
190,iyanna roberts was our waitress and she was fantastic yaya was very knowledgeable in reference to the food and drink menu yaya anticipated our every need she checked on us continuously throughout our meal she kept our drinks topped off i look forward to having iyanna as our waitress again iyanna is a valuable asset to the landry s team

192,we came in for a wedding the wedding started at 4pm and the hotel was nice enough to allow us in our room a little early so we could change and get ready in time the room was very nice very clean and rather spacious too our beds were comfortable and the blankets looked nice and white and clean the pillows were soft and there were plenty of them the bathroom was clean and we had enough towels for our family of four the breakfast the next morning was great the hot offerings were scrambled eggs and sausage gravy for biscuits they also offered waffles with a million fun toppings that my kids loved cereals oatmeal yogurts fruit and breads pastries actually on the fruit tray there was a red sliced fruit next to the pineapples that my husband loved but we couldn t identify now by my age i had assumed i d come across most typical fruits but we couldn t figure out what it was it was cut in long strips and a very dense sort of a fruit if anyone knows we d appreciate the info my kids spent some time in the pool and hot tub area both were decently clean and the room was nice i found it to be a little chilly in the pool room but nobody else seemed to mind it much it was a good stay the staff was very friendly especially the gentleman who checked us in on arrival sorry i don t remember your name
193,i was so excited to have a new restaurant that s so close to home also looking forward to some good mexican food i was kinda disappointed service not so great but it s brand new i hope it get better the food portions are huge for the price but no flavor chips and salsa and queso amazing i would go back for drinks and queso and chips
194,i m so excited about this new addition to the indiana avenue food plaza the official name i ve given it we tried this place for the first time the other day and both agreed we re going to be here a lot it was 11 for my chicken tikka rice bowl and two large masala samosas drinks are an additional 2 i think i love the way you order and specify exactly what fresh veggies you want on top i got chicken with saag and tikka masala curries with cilantro sauce it was fantastic spicy and flavorful the staff were all very friendly and patient too
195,what a great place for breakfast healthy options that are yummy other options that look yummy we love the atmosphere service and food

197,i ve always experienced great service at this discount tires yesterday aaron was especially helpful
198,husband and daughter and i came here for saturday brunch it was pretty empty when we first got there around 10am so we were seated right away husband and i ordered our endless mimosas and daughter got her juice daughter ordered the fresh toast husband ordered the huevos benitos and i ordered the bagel and lox i loved the bagel and lox the salmon was really good and we definitely got our moneys worth of mimosas our server was great a to of people have complained about the service but our server was lovely i forgot her name though i plan to keep coming back
199,i adore biscuits cafe the service is always wonderful the staff is warm and friendly i will often stop here to just grab a coffee to go they serve the best coffee in indianapolis,i am the mother to three girls girly girls made of glitter and sunshine and that is exactly what the cake bake shop is made of the key lime pie is beyond amazing so amazing that i have indeed paid the very high price for the whole pie the sipping chocolate is divine but what we continue to return for is the atmosphere it s precious and pink and decorated to the nines it s magical gwen has an eye for the details from the aprons to the decorations to the to go containers she spares no expense this place is worth a visit
200,i ve dubbed this place my new favorite burrito spot my favorite is the mexi burrito with asada flavorful unique and worth every penny i make sure to come to alderto s to get my fix every time i visit reno i almost don t want to leave this review to keep this a hidden spot but they deserve more business food is great and the service i ve received ordering to go has never been an issue
201,after exploring about 6 different shops to try and find someone to sew patches onto a leather vest i found saji on yelp here i gave her a call on a saturday morning and she told me to bring it over she had the vest done in a day and charged me a very good price compared to the other places i have talked to she met me on sunday her day off to give me the vest i would highly recommend her for any alterations or sewing work you need done she seemed very experienced and passionate about her work
202,suraya was beautiful all the colors decor and space was amazing there s a cafe section and a dining section as you walk in further my friend and i were looking for a place to eat a quick breakfast and work through lunch we came upon suraya and it was a wonderful experience i don t think i would ever say this because i am not much of a sweets person but their rose and pistachio cruller is probably the best pastry i have ever had in my life my mouth is still watering thinking about it since i had it five days ago on a trip to philly the staff and servers were all great one of them was so attentive and made sure to clear our plates and refill our water we then moved over to the dining area for lunch and we ordered the braised lamb hummus a beef tomato flatbread and a chicken sandwich the fries were phenomenal and we really loved the braised lamb hummus the flatbread was good but nothing out of the ordinary i d definitely come back to suraya just for that cruller
203,i was lucky to find eric at mystickal tymes i had inherited some loose twin pearls from my grandmother and didn t know what to do with them i brought them to eric to see what he thought eric did a design on the fly and i was amazed at what he came up with he then sent the pearls and his design to a very talented jewelry maker silversmith amazing artisan and i could not be more thrilled and pleased with the end result if you have broken family heirloom jewelry or jut loose stones you don t know what to do with i offer you some good advice when i say you should stop by mystickal tymes and let eric take a look it s a guarantee he will come up with something beautiful fyi my profile pic is of the two pieces of jewelry made a gorgeous ring and a fabulous matching pendant great shop great atmosphere don t miss this place if you are going to be in new hope pa best shop for spiritual needs i ve ever found and i ve lived all over eric knows his stuff is friendly and very down to earth
204,the best chicken sandwich ever i am addicted to the big mary combo i get tatters and macaroni salad this location has the best chicken poppers and the best dipping sauce is the honey mustard the gravy is drink worthy lol seriously lol
205,great nail salon very relaxing everyone is so nice and is very experienced compared to other salons it is a lot more quiet and relaxed
206,this delicious ramen really warmed me up i had the miso ramen and i loved the flavor profile of the broth the noodles were tasty and the picked vegetables added a great contrast to the heartiness of the broth that kept the flavor balanced and not too savory i also added on the black garlic wings because they were having a lunch special add an app for 4 i was not a huge fan even with lime juice sprinkled on the top the fry on the wings was too heavy for me i wonder if they were twice fried while i appreciated the crispiness i would pass on these the next time around i would add a caution that the restaurant is small and filled up for weekday lunch by about 12 15 they only have 4 2 person tables 1 4 person table and then the seats at the bar however this is a great place to come for a solid bowl of ramen especially if it s cold outside
207,pretty nice set up at this casino i like how they have different rooms with walk ways through each one different types of tables in multiple areas so you are not just stuck in the middle of a giant room with slot machines they had a live band playing and the music was very good the crowd around the band and bar was pretty filled up soda and water are comped for all people alcohol is not smoking is allowed everywhere except bathrooms it s very cool how the high roller room is separated with glass and a bit more quiet in their food and gift shops are sprinkled throughout the walk ways along with a buffet that i ve heard is very good parking was a little hectic because they are redoing half their parking so we had to make a few loops around the parking lot until we found someone leaving to get their spot i think this one is the best casino in the tucson area for gaming and tables was on a nice run on the black jack tables for over 2 hours until the infamous change up occurred and a different dealer came into the rotation and changed the vibes at the table still walked off with a nice stack of casino money will return here and check out the hotel along with the buffet next time
208,tim did an awesome job for our annual fundraising event at watkins college of art glimpse he is very responsive punctual and professional we would love to work with him again any song we requested he had ready tim was also very helpful in suggestions for the set up so that the music was better incorporated into the event you won t be disappointed he is old school cool and has years of experience thanks tim for helping make our event a fun engaging event
209,had the tenders and chicken mix and both were great the tenders were not processed but pulled chicken breast fries were perfect crispy and slightly thicker than your average fry and the honey biscuit was really great their daquries are good and large as well apple mango pina colada hurricane hypnotic margarita and more i had the mango hurricane mix definitely good drunk or not
210,i love this place as someone who has eaten a lot of indian food i can say that this one is really good there are a lot of veggie options too and the place has a nice atmosphere i ve never been for lunch but i ve heard they do a buffet which would be a great time to try new things if you re not sure what you like yet the only thing i found unusual was putting a little bit of shredded cheese on top of my dish for garnish which i d never seen done at an indian place before overall 5 stars give it a shot
211,going with 4 stars for a few reasons first off i have been here twice around the same time of day around 4pm on weekdays happy hour is 4 7pm and the specials are 50 off of liquor beer and wine most of them and 6 appetizers i ve enjoyed a little bit of everything here and i respect their beer selection great crafts on draft as well as many choices for wine anything 9 or less is half off the bartenders were great and really willing to help the first time i stopped by here i had the oysters and they were so awesome that my friend and i ordered a second round the second time i visited my friends and i split the spinach artichoke dip and hummus plate plenty of food and we were given extra pita bread because there was so much dip to enjoy the view is really what brought me here right on the bay next to jackson s plenty of seating inside or outside at the bar validate your parking with the hostess at the front and your first two hours of parking in the garage are free my only woe it gets super crowded once happy hour starts to crank up you ll need to be dressed nice to fit in after 6pm my best advice is to arrive just before 4pm enjoy the view and the happy hour menu for a bit then check out with your validated parking pass but overall a nice addition to harbour island,five stars is not nearly enough to describe how i feel about this restaurant it is wonderful on so many levels from the service to the food to the decor i recently was searching for a brunch spot near the beach that could accommodate my group of friends and had a good mimosa deal here it is i made reservations for 8 people easily on open table we stopped by on a sunny saturday afternoon and were seated immediately in a private back room i must start with the service because above all it was the best i ve ever had at a restaurant you read that right our waitress caddea was so amazingly wonderful she handled our group with ease filling glasses before they were even empty bringing accurate orders and simply acting like a good friend of ours service with a smile doesn t even begin to describe how she treated us i had interacted with the owner ruthie on facebook prior to arriving to make sure we could secure a deal and there would be room for us and she showed up to greet me at the table a fun and enthusiastic woman with a heart of gold so the food and drink awesome selection and something for anyone menu items are priced very reasonably and they have so many options to suit your dietary needs gluten free healthy vegan etc i went with the egg white scramble and it was a nice big portion fresh ingredients and it came to the table quickly other food at the table looked great and everyone enjoyed their meals for drinks we got to enjoy bottomless mimosas which were made perfectly and filled often 14 95 is a steal for this deal please note this is actually a deal only available on sundays i can t wait to go back to this restaurant not only for the food but to support the wonderful people that work here they made my day and everyone at our table agreed this was the best brunch we have ever had together go
212,hellas is where i go to get great greek food especially when they have there greek dining music and dancing outside by the marina i like the atmosphere and there food is always consistent which is very important to me sponge docks is a great fun place to go out for the evening
213,it s a place to go if your hungry and have a big appetite burgers are good and come out quick there onion straws are to die for with the sauce the service was on top of things right away thanks zack made us feel welcomed and was that way to everybody even helped other servers when he probably didn t have to would recommend this place to others in a heart beat however we came to early to hear the live music but was outside with a great breeze can t ask for much more
214,they were very professional and did a great job i have a dog and anthony was very respectful about his safety i gave them a wrong count on my registers in my home by accident and they honored the quote which was close to 200 00 less i would totally recommend them
215,yolk had the hustle and bustle that you would expect from a brunch place on a sunday morning the wait wasn t terribly long and we were seated relatively quickly they have a wide variety of things on their menu that good my favorite thing about the menu was that you could substitute a normal side for one of their sweet specialities for only 3 so i was able to get an omelet a side of grits and i upgraded to banana bread french toast overall the food was good but it wasn t amazing the french toast and grits were my favorite thing about the meal for some reason the omelet just didn t do it for me i would go back and try a few other things off the menu but i don t think it makes my list of top brunch places in indy
216,live this place my husband and i were looking for a place to have lunch and maynard s caught our eye i ordered half sloppy joe with a salad and my husband got the corn beef my sloppy joe was great and brought back childhood memories of the sandwiches my mom made only this was way better the salad was light and refreshing and i liked that the dressing wasn t overwhelming but complimentary my husband said the corn beef was amazing one of the best he s had the staff here is very friendly and made us feel very welcome
217,my husband and i went in for a late lunch early dinner on a saturday it was a very nice experience we ordered a few different items off of the happy hour menu and they were all delicious they have a large beer menu and the cocktails were very well made nice atmosphere and good service the best part was the banana chocolate cake
218,normally i m not a bar person but i heard the food from this pub was legit and on mondays the burgers that are normally 10 bucks for only 5 bucks i always like a deal my wife got the cheesesteak she wasn t feeling burgers first we decided to split the order of parmesan garlic wings outstanding they were cooked nice and crispy and were meaty my wife really enjoyed her steak and she let me try a bite and it was very good meat was very flavorful and roll was super pillowy since the burgers were only 5 mondays only i decided to get two of them because what accompanies a burger better than another burger i gluttonously ate both of them the meat was very flavorful and perfectly cooked medium the bun was perfect and the accoutrements were fresh still very shocking of how good their burgers are and i did not expect to be so wowed all the food here was excellent will definitely be back for more
219,favorite caffe from now on green apple ade plus banana walnut honey bread wow out of this world omg the smell of the banana cake is wow and did you see the packages presentation
220,it s above average for a walmart with some things you just simply wouldn t see stocked in other walmart s they also have a great selection and everything is always fully stocked however the bathrooms are very filthy
221,alway s very friendly staff and clean environment with a nice patio i always order the turkey gobbler burger which is very good i would rate this place a 5 but there s nothing else i like if your into salads organic food or a vegetarian you ll probably love it here
222,perfect location to walk to everything in the french quarter the room was small but efficient for what we needed we even had a great view of the mississippi river 16th floor the staff front desk bellmen and housekeeping were great and had nice customer service skills the hotel is 3 star level but the price for what you receive you just cant beat
223,delicious and savory pizza i ordered 6 pizzas aloha chicken bbq chicken hawaiian chicken parmesan jet 10 and veggie i also ordered two salads caesar salad and garden salad it was for work lunch for a group of 30 people first of all the delivery was earlier than expected the lady was super nice and brought so many utensils plates and napkins second of all the pizza was absolutely delicious my personal favorite was chicken parmesan the salad was fresh and the dressing was extra tasty my co workers all enjoyed the pizzas and salads and i will definitely be ordering from you guys again thank you for such wonderful food and amazing service
224,good food and good solid service my wife and i loved the complementary bread too we had the langostino lobster artichoke and seafood dip as an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious so tasty so good for our entrees we had tuna and shrimp tacos both were very good we got the lobster mashed potatoes and it was out of this world a very good meal
225,the breakfast menu and pastry menu changes so some visits i have liked more than others but i love the way they do there menu the overall quality is top notch the food is funky and creative i would not say its an every weekend brunch spot with the old reliable eggs florentine pancakes but it is fun and i love coming here from time to time beware the line can get long but they have very good coffee and pastries to hold you over while you wait p s the restaurant vibes are great
226,my niece and i decided to come here for some dessert this was my first time here and wasn t sure what to expect of course i had to order the ube be baby and my niece wanted the vanilla vanilla strawberry the machine for the ube ran out so my serving was a little short but they offered me more when it was back up i do have to say it is a little overpriced for some dessert
227,a casual dining experience that exemplifies everything santa barbara great food great atmosphere great service sit out on the patio and the place just lets you exhale and literally enjoy a little spot in paradise we have never had a bad meal here there are so many great specials salads etc on the menu you may bypass the burger don t they serve up one of the best burgers you will ever taste
228,went for a sunday jazz afternoon what a terrific place for a gathering i highly recommend the basis and merlot was amazed at the complexity of all of the wines wish it was closer to me so i could go back more often pizza is not to be missed
229,this will be all over the place because it s not simply a straight up review of an eatery let s start on positive side the food it s good maybe even really good depending on the time day almost great at times i ve had several of the burgers and they are usually good i ve had with bun and as a wrap both good but if you get as a wrap tell them to serve on a plate instead of the tray with paper you start cutting into a juicy burger on paper and you end up eating a lot of paper the fries are good but they are hit or miss hard to find a hotel eatery that is this good normally they are substandard even for fast food standards with that said the fact that it s part of a hotel is one reason for the inconsistency in quality and the consistent issue with service the not so good service it just isn t good from bartenders who are more fixated on their fiends who are visiting to wait staff that are inattentive absent minded or untrained unaware if i could pick something they are consistent with it s service issues the price this place preys on being convenient for guests of the hotel it s an expensive burger the apps and sides are expensive the beer is expensive you get the drift it s expensive this makes the above item even more amplified there are better alternatives to this place in the area unless you are at the hotel and just don t want to go anywhere i d try something else if your stuck patience and prepare to pay it will be a good burger but ultimately you ll walk away unsatisfied
230,love this place introduced almost 25 years ago when i enrolled at the ud and have loved ever since for longest time it was basically just a delaware treat but so happy it is so many more places now just want to know when you are coming to the huntsville al area sorry this review is not about this specific location but if it is half as good as others i have been to it will be great this location has plenty of seating was real clean and playing good tunes as i waited about only negative is it doesn t have herrs chips like the delaware locations but that is not really a problem
231,holy great sandwiches we discovered this place at the end of last season and i can t wait to go back everything we tried was incredibly tasty don t be discouraged with the long line outside it moves quite quickly you will not be disappointed
232,these cakes will be the death of me they are soooooo good they are rich and filling for even just the smallest cake could feed a bunch of people as dessert the pricing isn t too bad and the options of flavors is never lacking my absolute favorite was the carrot cake it had chunks of pineapple in it which provided an a perfect amount of acidity to the cake oh and their frosting is the best cream cheese frosting i have ever had
233,awesome place very hospitable hosts a must visit
234,good quick and local smog place does only smogs so you re in and out in a jiffy everytime they take competitors coupons so hold onto those coupons
235,absolutely wonderful service food amazing if you are in clearwater you need to try this place home cooking southern hospitality wow amazing
236,we had a terrific experience with jaguar of nashville working with josh muraira was such a pleasure he made us feel so appreciated and well cared for throughout the entire process we had no idea we would end up leasing a new car but we re so happy with our choice and with the experience josh worked tirelessly to help us find the car we wanted putting in time after hours and on the weekends to make sure we were happy we talked to a number of other auto dealerships when we were looking for a new vehicle but we received the best treatment by far from jaguar of nashville i also want to thank art anderson for helping us get all the bells and whistles set up in our new car i know he stayed late to accommodate our schedule and we are super grateful i m looking forward to a long relationship with jaguar of nashville
237,meatball sandwiches are fabulous great flavor the bun was fresh and crisp the counter girl was warm and welcoming but not yet professional enough she undercharged us but we corrected her mistake maybe there are too many tables and chairs why not put together the tables into the italian long family tables with red checkered plastic table cloths love chef cheries cooking and breakfast lunch menu
238,pleasant experience decent sushi clean environment and efficient employees just want to say thank you for the free birthday dinner i feel that most ayce sushi in the reno area is the same give or take i will be back to this restaurant due to their generosity that others do not offer
239,jacob provided us with prompt service to quickly troubleshoot a couple of bathroom light switches we will definitely use him again for all of our electrical needs
240,our server was wonderful so polite and nice mannered the food oh my goodness enough said portions are a great size prices very affordable i had the jambalaya and catfish bites and the food was moist and well seasoned the bites were so light and flaky and hot the cornbread is sooo fluffy and warm still and moist visit this place
241,okay the food is amazing love their vegetarian lasagna it is a bit over priced honestly especially for their portions but that s just me their biggest problem is honestly the lack of air in that place they need acs or like windows or something it gets super stuffy
242,we went close to closing time and i was worried the buffet would have limited options as sometimes happens with a buffet that was absolutely not the case there was plenty and it was all hot fresh and delicious we took our daughter because she had never had indian food it was a hit
243,you want to talk about some good ribs al has them nice chill vibe in his restaurant sides are great will be going back very soon here s my half rack
244,hard to find a sushi spot with good quality ingredients service was amazing as well the waiter accidentally forgot to take one of our orders and later gave us complementary dessert to make up for it got the fishtown roll dynamite white tuna and green tea cake with chocolate ub ice cream
245,if you love plants you need to visit this place it is both nursery and gardens and both score top points i love the way they organize their plants for sale by climate and feel so if you are going for a shabby chic kind of look you can browse in the cottage section if you are looking for more of a palm springs look shop in the succulent section we were able to get two hard to find plants native to australia that i had been searching for afterwards stroll through the lush gardens that include a tropical south african and asian section it is also near some orchid nurseries which are also open for visits a great weekend outing
246,great coffee pastries and wide ranging of unique menu options situated in a wonderful neighborhood fletcher place and filled with eclectic patrons waiting for a table is fun purely from a people watching standpoint
247,trying something different tonight we had the wings garlic with cheese never had them before very good taste our waitress was very friendly and she suggested the wings found out that her grandfather vietnam and father air force were veterans she thanked me for myservice theyalso gives veterans discount here that s why i gave them a high raining
248,one of the best mexican restaurants in the old pueblo excellent food excellent service 2 thumbs up
249,i ve been going here for 5 years now and they re just great i don t understand those reviews who don t understand what the lunk system s for we don t call them lunks because they re buff we call lunks to those who slam weights down don t wipe their equipment make sound etc i think it s a great idea and it s apparently working because i ve never seen one in a long time true they have old equipment but it s not like you re going there to play with the equipment you re there to work out and it works perfectly fine sadly i m looking to go to the northtowne one because they re closer to my house hopefully they have great customer service there if not i d be happy to come back here
250,this place continues to deliver excellent food and menu options it s simple tastes great and welcoming environment we have been coming here for the last 3 years and never had a bad meal i recently went vegan and the menu has options they are will to modify ingredients without any issue prices are more than reasonable for the portion and quality beer options don t disappoint even better during happy hour here s to keeping it real and local
251,nights here are hit and miss for me will the be a band a dj kareoke who knows i have had some very fun nights here when there is a good band playing as a local i m not a huge fan of partying in an overcrowded casino and brew brothers is one of the more popular places if you happen to be at the el dorado or silver legacy maybe swing by to check out what s going on drinks are average priced but not very great
252,don t be deterred by the line it moves fast and is an indication of how great the select of sandwiches are at this place it was very hard to make a decision given the awesome variety of both hot and cold style sandwiches but i went with the hot beef and was not upset with my decision many of the sandwiches are served on the type of bread you find in new orleans when you order a muffuletta so it has a good balanced mix of both soft and chewy texture the beef was piled high so you get your money s worth and i recommend washing it down with a beer from urban chestnut or 4hands which they have cans of if you are eating in next time i m in stl i will make this place a top of my list to return to and highly recommend you give it a try if you want a high quality sandwich
253,well for starters i enjoyed breakfast there for the first time clean inside outside the restrooms were clean i like the decor it was like a tropical scenery for breakfast had shrimp and grits with a waffle i had the seafood omelette with 2 pancakes it was like homemade pancakes the sweet tea and orange juice were so good the service was quick and hot our food and service was awesome i gave it 4 stars bc the shrimp and eggs just don t go together to me those 2 things are not compatible but i would recommend this place for breakfast now i would like to come here when it s warm outside for dinner there is outside seating with a pond view
254,i love this place great fresh pasta made on site and a very complete wine offering i will continue to support this place we always bring friends here when in town from other places around the country all are impressed
255,i love this place i m actually shocked that i ve never done a review i ve been to both philly locations and this one and it s delicious the food is fresh the service is impeccable please be prepared to wait on the weekend because this place is popular whenever we have guests in town we take them to them to sabrina s to guarantee a great time if i can find pictures i will edit my review
256,this food is dam good the sliders were amazing i recommend getting the brown bag special two sliders fries and homemade soda if you have a small appetite consider sharing don t let the size of the sliders fool you they are filling and don t you dare go without getting a donut they re the best donuts in new orleans
257,amanda was very helpful and friendly with answering all my questions with contacts and glasses
258,went to the spa today for a day of relaxation here are my thoughts staff 5 5 everyone from the receptionist to the massage therapists to the cleaning staff was warm and welcoming coming into a spa with friendly people definitely adds to the experience facilities 3 5 the massage beds were amazing comfortable and heated but the rest of the spa was somewhat lacking in my opinion for the price the relaxation room pictured while super comfortable was small other than the massage facilities the sauna and steam room were pretty small locker room was clean but also relatively small they did give you a choice of beverage including champagne in the relaxation room in between treatments facial is 10 out a 5 and option i had the 80 min purify facial with courtney she was absolutely fantastic she took the time to ask questions about my skin and what i wanted out of the treatment personally i have sensitive acne prone skin in the past with facials i have left very irritated or found the facials hard to enjoy because the products would irritate my face all the products she used were great and the massage with the facial was also great she really listened to my skin needs couldn t have asked for a more relaxing experience i would a million perfect recommend courtney for your facial needs massage 2 5 for the price i was expecting more i had a 50 min swedish massage with nancy maybe i just didn t like the style of the massage that much but this wasn t my favorite massage the areas she focused on were not what i had requested and the pressure was a bit too firm i think you would enjoy nancy if you liked a medium to firm massage
259,amazing food great atmosphere we sat at the bar due to a full house the bartender mary was a bit uninviting she told us we will be waiting a very long time if we ordered at the bar because the tables were first comers which made absolutely no sense to us another couple sat on the side of us and they to received an uninviting welcome we still ordered our food with mary where she again told us it was going to be a long time but we did not change our minds our food came out at a reasonable time leaving us a bit confused as to why she was lacking her customer service we will be back for the food just not sit with the bartender dining out is all about the experience and we hope to have a better one next time
260,given the recent flooding and fire activity we decided to try a maid service we landed on nancy s given the other reviews it has been a couple of weeks since the service and we thought enough time had passed for an honest review the service was at best average we paid scheduled a deep clean with stove cleaning the stove cleaning was missed as in we paid for it but they didn t do it and several spots were missed as dust bunnies can be spotted behind the bed dresser and behind the foot locker dusting under the beds would have also been missed if my wife didn t check before the team left our home to be fair when told about the misses nancy and team wanted to return to the home to make it better right but in our view there should not have been these misses to begin with we declined the offer our advice if you decide to use this service would be to double check behind the team to ensure all spots are clean and double check or suggest provide the cleaning products used to ensure your home has that bleach smell we all know and love
261,first time here yesterday and we loved the donuts we loved the build your own concept which is great because you get to try different combinations of the things you like here are my thoughts something to consider when you go pros 1 long line packed with people but the wait for the donuts weren t long considering the amount of people there 2 when you get to the counter you kinda already know what you want because they have order forms for you to fill out while waiting in line so the lines move pretty quickly 3 you can let them know if peanut allergies and they can accommodate 4 donuts are made fresh constantly cons 1 if you have a nut allergy your choices are limited in what you can order for example you can t get the s mores one which is the one we wanted 2 the order forms does not list all the specialty donuts that were available so you ll have to make that decision at the counter 3 i wanted to order iced coffee on the menu but was told that they didn t have iced coffee i would have to get a cup of ice and poor hot coffee over it you can guess why this wouldn t work all in all we loved the donuts and had a pleasant experience with the kids the pros do outweigh the cons for sure the cons are more for fyi if you re a first timer like us
262,went into store with my headphones needing some assistance chris took a look at them took his time and repaired them then to my surprise despite his trouble and my offering did not charge anything for the repair awesome store and staff would definitely return for any electronic issues
263,this is the best shrimp and grits i ve ever tasted the cornbread is unique and tasty the service was amazing i will definitely be going back
264,i love their mobile grooming service elizabeth brings the grooming bus and all four of our dogs are groomed the same morning
265,very good chinese place some food was only semi warm but did not have any effect on the experience staff very attentive and i appreciated the ice cream machine
266,i haven t stayed there yet but if customer service is any indication they definitely deserve a 5 i phoned on a sunday at check out time i could hear they were busy but the clerk linda wanda was so kind she suggested i leave a message in sales regarding my issue which i did first thing this am i received a call from thuy i understand she is the director of sales at the hotel thuy could not have been more accommodating she patiently listened to my concerns and was super helpful i am looking forward to personally thanking the individuals for their kindness
267,the sub was great but the attitude of the cashier was not very pleasant she had a very rude tone the whole time as if someone ordering a sandwich was ruining her day that s what makes me not want to come back
268,i had an issue with the washer dryer combo as it created more problems than the manufacturer probably expected however after i expressed my concerns to the management staff of 930 poydras they immediately began to work on a solution their solution will now save me at a minimum of 200 month on dry cleaning costs i want to express my appreciation to the staff of 930 poydras for them taking my concerns seriously and immediately resolving them i hope to reside here a few more years while i serve the city of new orleans grateful monica soileau
269,this store has amazing products and very knowledgeable staff to help you find the product best for you i was especially helped by kat who showed me multiple options and samples for what i was looking for i always leave this store with exactly what i need and more i don t go anywhere else
270,healthy plentiful overall great my girlfriend and i were visiting sb and we shopped around downtown sb during black friday we were a little hungry but not for heavy food luckily we were able to go to this local acai bowl spot and got just what we wanted we both got bowls and they were pretty well sized absolutely taste full of fruit and there s actually a hefty selection of types of bowls to choose from there s different bowls for everyone so no matter who s in your party there s something for everyone
271,four stars for price i drive truck so i ve eaten bbq all over america this place is better than most but it s certainly not 4 star worthy i d say the food is more like 2 5 star the cheeseburger was quite large and the meat was tasty be advised if you don t stop them they ll automatically put that disgusting invention called mayonnaise on it i got it plain so i can t comment on their lettuce tomato game the pork bbq sammich was soggy on the bottom moist is good but this was just plain wet the meat itself was bland but not bad the bbq sauce is pretty good but not great the mac cheese tasted ok but the noodles were way overcooked it d be much better if it were baked and had a little crustiness to it if i lived local i m sure i d come here occasionally
272,i ate at this restaurant last night monday which is 1 00 taco night the tacos are good for the price they also have margaritas on special this night if you plan to drink beer you re better off for the money getting the 8 00 32 ounce mug if you plan to dine on monday get there between 4 30 pm and 5 15 pm because it s packed after that time they also have live music on monday enjoy
273,rachel is the best highly recommend her talents for creative solutions this is a great place to get a haircut in philly
274,kudos to this place for providing a much needed late night snack while i was visiting nashville didn t have to wait on delivery because they allowed pick up at 2 am pizza honestly looked like it wasn t going to be all that great but looks were deceiving the pizza was delicious and my only regret was that i didn t order a bigger one
275,i honestly think i have found my new favorite taco stop in center city sure el rey is delicious but their prices are pretty high unless you go to their happy hour which is usually so packed you can barely get an order in i ve gone to this place twice after church and have enjoyed it both times i think i might have found a new sunday tradition ambiance a pretty small joint with bright colors that really liven up the room while the restaurant can only sit about 20 people the lively colors and open garage door window really opens up the place food 9 for three tacos and a side of chips might seem expensive but they are loaded up with the protein of your choosing you can choose your topping too but don t go overboard aka keep it simple stupid these tacos only need a few things a bit of salsa pickled onions and maybe some lettuce if you are into that sure you can pile on cheese guac and sour cream but you will lose the flavor of the meats speaking of which the al pastor is by far the best option they have it on a spit and slice it off fresh and sear it each time you order you get just the right amount of citrus in each bite the carnitas are good but if you want to go with pork stick with the al pastor the short rib barbocoa is super juicy and savory but can be too heavily salted for some people service since this is a fast casual restaurant service is pretty much limited to that behind the counter all the employees i ve interacted with have been considerate and kind especially when i ask for more toppings drinks selection of american and mexican coke soda products so no complaints here if you need water you can ask and the employees can bring you a glass for free
276,dawn patrol is a pretty average brunch spot with higher than average prices i chose to build my own hash because i noticed that you can do so with sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes i asked that my sweet potatoes peppers and onions be tossed with sage sausage mushrooms spinach and tomatoes and topped with poached eggs the eggs were cooked perfectly though i had requested hollandaise sauce on the side i ended up smothering my hash with the runny yolks my dad ordered the patrol combo and some oolong green tea he was satisfied with his food but didn t end up drinking his tea because it over steeped and tasted very bitter my biggest complaint is that the traffic picked up around 11am and made it difficult to have a conversation or hear the music on the patio try to go before then for a quieter more enjoyable meal
277,although i feel the price is a little high for the food it doesn t stop us from going on a regular the location and the feel of the couch and chairs makes for a comfortable setting for us with our daughter who likes to be on the move while she eats
278,i showed up here with 5 kids and 5 adults and the staff was so friendly accommodating and super patient the chicken cheesesteaks are amazing and the fries are crispy and seasoned well they had chocolate and vanilla ice cream for all of the kids too
279,my boyfriend and his friends go every year for his birthday and it s always a great place to stay with a large group even with kids they ve got everything from arcade gym with a room to do yoga stretching etc pools spa club etc i m not much of a gambler but definitely enjoy the rest of the amenities rooms are definitely a tad older then others and i would say food quality could improve and the crowd is interesting i ll leave it at that it s definitely not vegas but you re also not paying vegas prices
280,loved besito s the food and service were amazing we will definitely be back freshest mexican food i ve ever had andy was a fun waiter
281,this place is right around the corner and i m sooo glad that it is delicious barbecue that s decently priced will return
282,sure there s dunkin and wawa and all that other mass produced store baked product tempting you but nothing like a freshly freshly made cake donut federal donuts is slowly spreading across philly like chicken pox with people itching to get their hands on one of the homemade concoctions the flavors of the day ranged from snow cap to coffee cake to peanut butter malt at 2 75 ea they re more than you d pay for at the gas station but but also significantly more satisfying the hot fresh flavors include cookies and cream cinnamln brown sugar and strawberry lavender since this was a mto item it also needed to be consumed immediately having never had a truly right off the line cake donut specific because krispy kreme and yea they re best when fresh i was normally disappointed with most cake donuts because they tended to be heavy and leaden and not that satisfying this one was superb light fluffy and still very warm the strawberry lavender sugar may have been the only tick containing definite floral notes from the lavender i would have preferred a stronger strawberry flavor nonetheless the donut itself was the best one i ve had even if the flavor was not shortly thereafter consumption of the fancy donuts commenced all donuts were cake donuts and the flavors and glazes added while they were warm allowed them to make that sugary outer crust that i love favorites of the mrs and i were the snow cap peanut butter malt and the coffee cake far from fancy but spot on delicious it s definitely worth a trip next time we ll get some fried chicken too
283,it s going to get four stars three for the perfectly cooked delicious cheap lobster an extra star since we had great service and you get a bib all restaurants should have a bib option if you want lobster this is the place for you they have 1 pound 2 pound 3 pound and any mix in between if you re coming for anything else or expect fantastic side choices this is not the place for you they have a fresh seafood counter with good prices the fish dip must be delicious but they ran out insert sad face the soup was pudding like but such high potential with fresh lobster piled on top of your mug of chowdah although it says only beer and wine it looks like a full bar to me good beer selection served in a bottle if i want to eat lobster this is my place
284,just so good my group tried two different cheeseburgers and two of us got phillys the sub sandwich bread was delicious the burgers came with steak fries that were so good it was an interesting experience to go into the market and pick drinks and order at the counter there was plenty of seating with indoor and outdoor the only thing that was a bit tricky was how knowing when to grab food if you sit outside but staff said they were working out a new system happy eating
285,easy glide into tuesday evening cooler buddies dipa capped with the shade tree ipa fold in a perfect playlist and you re good to go love this place
286,great food the chef uses true latin ingredients fusioned in an interesting and delicious way the servers are attentive polite and friendly and the music is very good overall delicia is one of my favorite restaurants in indianapolis
287,handlebar is a great a great two hours and would recommend any night of the week arrive early grab one of the seats without pedals or up front that take all the work the stops were spot on the drivers adds to the great time too
288,absolutely delicious pizza breadsticks were good and both the cheese and marinara were delicious too this would be a 5 star rating if it wasn t for their extremely slow service and rude employees i went at 3pm and there was absolutely no one in the store but me the guy that came to help me made it seem like i was a big inconvenience to him i ll definitely go back because the pizza was great just hope they figure out how to get some good workers in there
289,the idea is cool but the tacos were a bit of a disappointment we got the chicken carne asada and fish tacos the chicken was dry and carne asada was salty so it wasn t full of flavor the fish taco was good though tender juicy and crispy i don t think the tacos are worth the price especially since tacos are supposed to be a cheap simple and delicious food overall i wouldn t go back but it is a cool atmosphere and right in downtown which is convenient
290,4 and a half stars a lovely little italian seafood place not far off i 95 south of the airport they have many meat dishes too but we did not get to try them had lunch there and we had 2 specials the grouper special and the pasta with seafood shrimp lobster tail and crab both were excellent fresh seafood beautifully cooked with nice sides vegetables and potatoes the restaurant itself has some old world charm to it i believe it is a byo place so if you go for dinner be prepared
291,one of the best indian food spots in town don t let the outside appearance fool you the food is absolutely amazing and the staff is friendly get there early due to the size it fills up quickly enjoy and ya welcome
292,this is such a great breakfast spot to eat in the gulch neighborhood area parking is located directly across the street and the first hour is free if you arrive early you will more then likely get seated promptly the place itself has plenty of seating for small and larger groups if you re looking to order and grab and go there is that option as well for starters i was highly impressed with the service and hospitality my drink and meal order was taken promptly and brought out even faster i ordered a vanilla bean latte made with coconut milk and the hot mess the aroma of the latte alone was mouth watering overall everything was great and had amazing flavor this place is definitely a must try if in the nashville area
293,park on the pier for free if you can find parking if not just do valet and tip the guy the wait here on a saturday late afternoon wasn t too bad for 2 we just want something to snack on before dinner we got the crab for 22 was disappointed because they crab was so small the slaw that was given tasted so bland and even have crab shells in there probably from the guy chopping up the crab in the back we tried the clam chowder and it wasn t anything spectacular will not be coming back
294,never stayed here in a room before but have been to the bar many times the carousel bar is very cool and historic even if you re walking by stop in and have a drink
295,i love this place the seafood is always amazing and you can t beat the view gabby was great highly recommend if you re ever in the tampa st pete area
296,awesome place for weekend lunch great discovery of californian was treated to this place before flying back to the bay area after a weekend sojourn
297,nauti mermaid is a cool new restaurant with a great ambiance we went on a friday evening and it was packed had about a 20 minute wait but we went upstairs to the dueling piano bar jolly s for drinks the restaurant did just open and it appeared they were under staffed for a friday night we ordered the bookmakers salad and colossal crab cakes the salad was good but the menu called for grilled shrimp and what was served was cocktail shrimp the crab cakes we re phenomenal cooked perfect and great portion size the fries and cole slaw that accompanied the crab cakes were also delicious the fried were crisp on the outside with a soft center and the cole slaw was very light and not overpowering it was the perfect side dish for the crab cakes and fries overall the food was great and we will be back because of it on food alone i would say it was a hard 4 5 the reason for the 3 5 was due to service which can easily be corrected with more staff looking forward to our next visit
298,great food great customer service small little authentic taco joint with all the fixings so many choices to choose from and you can t go wrong with any choice you make i think i ve had about everything they have to offer i love the elotes cup and the sopes you must come here oh everything is made fresh
299,tj is a life saver and she is worth every penny she has already come to my rescue twice now with the help of breastfeeding my son who has a tongue tie which has made things much harder than i had ever imagined she has given me so many tips and tricks been so patient and brought me a lot of peace and confidence in breastfeeding him mama s latte always gets back to you right away and comes out for a visit almost immediately the service couldn t be any better and i couldn t be happier with my choice in getting help from them thank you again tj
300,my favorite place downtown great rooftop great food great cocktails and wine list
301,my visit to nook was quite pleasant the service was super but the food was just okay i had high hopes for this diner but i was let down by the quality of the food i got the paleo pizza and the crust was very dry and didn t hold its shape the flavor was good but i probably would not get this a second time overall i enjoyed the experience but i wasn t a fan of the paleo food
302,i made a reservation for a bridal party of 7 people to have manicures and pedicures the evening before the wedding everyone at imperial nails made our evening fantastic we had the place to ourselves all evening and had an absolute blast i cannot thank them enough for helping to make the night before my friend s wedding a wonderful memory
303,we stayed at peddlers village for a wedding decided we liked the looks of earl s we went in just as lunch was ending but before dinner we were told we could make a reservation for 30 minutes later and come back a little strange we thought the woman at the desk seems to think she is the gate keeper much like the soup nazi lol we returned as instructed and waited with six other groups for the clock to read precisely 5pm at 5pm she asked who had reservations even with the restaurant empty and sat us all in order of reservations then non reservations she made a very loud general announcement to this effect we all chuckled amongst ourselves oh and the food was good
304,last night me and 24 others were visiting from houston texas and we had jabari as a waiter and mike and billy cooking grilling our oysters our service was superb and the food was outstanding anyone going by ask for jabari you will not be disappointed
305,in short vetri cucina is worth the hype it s rare to attend one of the most well acclaimed restaurant in philly but when you snag that available spot on opentable then get ready for a culinary experience that will loosen your belt and rock your socks off unfortunately this review is many months post the vetri experience so much of my memories are piecemealed together through my photos however while vetri cucina is a tasting menu extravaganza you should definitely consider a daytime fast for the epic amount of food that you ll be encouraged to consume in a 2 hour feasting session oh did i mention the 6 dessert finisher just saying everything at vetri cucina was thrilling from the hand made pasta to the expertly stuffed lamb sausage to the roasted duck breast even the olives were to dine for i will say that the service felt a bit off only because we were served by an inconsistent number of people and the wine pairing came at odd intervals and the unclear explanations of each dish made the experience falter but i think it was excusable overall overall food 5 stars price 5 stars service 3 4 stars ambiance 5 stars,we had a great time chowing down at this little italian pizza joint be warned that while all of my friends tried their pizza and loved it i did not partake also there is technically parking available but it gets filled up super quickly so be prepared to wait awkwardly if you come during busy dinner time as a large group we pretty much ordered all of the appetizers including greco salad the broccolini caesar salad the roasted bronzino crispy artichokes meatball chicken parm asparagus octopus short ribs and a multitude of pizzas including margherita eggplant mushroom and zucchii and cipolla while i can t speak much about the pizza but heard great things about the cipolla i really enjoyed the two salads especially the broccolini and the spicy chicken parm the asparagus and artichokes were a bit too over oiled or fried for my taste the short ribs were decent but just also a bit too fatty the octopus was a tad bit on the chewy side and given how much it cost with how little were on the plate i d likely not get it in the future i think if you want to eat frugally the pizza and salad combination is likely the way to go as the antipasti can add up but overall it s a decent but expensive little italian joint food 3 4 stars service 3 4 stars price 2 3 stars ambiance 3 stars
306,everything was wonderful comfortable bed clean room great food pasta real eggs sausage chicken tortilla etc three free drinks friendly staff will stay there again next visit it was close to acme seafood and hardrock cafe two blocks from frnch quarter
307,working out with adam is awesome he not only has great knowledge and knows perfect form but he also has a fun personality and i really enjoy the workouts adam knows how to teach and gives everyone the attention they need you will be impressed with your strength gains if work out under adam and do what he says i would definitely recommend him and this gym
308,my mom and i were in town for the day and i looked up the best lash places on yelp and found this one it was a miracle we were both able to get in same day there was a fortunate cancellation while it was more expensive than any other lash place i ve gone to to get a full set i have to say i am so happy with them i had jared and he was phenomenal easy to talk to kind to my son that i wouldn t normally bring to something like this but it was necessary and finally did the most fantastic work on my lashes my mother is tempted to drive 3 hours every few weeks to come back to this place she was so impressed you get what you pay for and i payed for the most beautiful lashes i ve ever had
309,i definitely check the bathroom to rate the cleanliness of a restaurant and of all the pho places i ve been to this has been the most clean thus far quiet well decorated friendly staff that i m not accustomed to from the pho places in san francisco this restaurant surely deserves the rate that it has
310,call ahead for seating especially for brunch luckily we did this for our large group and we did not have to wait for a table we had a group of 9 and they were able to put tables together easily the location is also handicap accessible as our group had one member in a wheelchair one note though is it is next to impossible to get someone in a wheelchair to their bathrooms if you are on crutches or more mobile you should be good to go the food was excellent and so were the mimosas however do not come here for brunch if you are in a hurry it took about 40 minutes for our food to arrive after ordering if you are alone it is possible you will have a faster turn around but not guaranteed don t say i didn t warn you the reason i do not leave 5 stars is due to there only being two non gender single bathrooms the bathrooms not being wheelchair accessible and the excessive wait for our food
311,amazing place the atmosphere and the food is just amazing the beacon was just melting in our mouthes jillian treated us magnificently she s great super recommended
312,visiting philadelphia on a college visiting trip and was wandering with the tribe family and got hungry we just finished visiting the liberty bell and independence hall around 5pm ish so we picked the red owl tavern on a whim toftt and won the place is a little cozy downstairs and the chairs were the solid steel chairs with no padding i kind of like the padding on chairs and thought this wasn t going to be a good choice there were lots of patrons at the bar which i took as a good sign small plates worked beverages were cold and the service was fine ordered the grilled octopus carpaccio and steamed mussels since the tables weren t too busy the turnaround was quick the octopus was severed on a bed of potatoes with chorizo and puree chili the tentacles were prepared so it was soft and tender the only gripe was there we re only two tentacles hardly what i expected in quantity the carpaccio was tasty and well presented the best dish was the steamed mussels in garlic and shallots great tasting and by far the best value it was paired with slices of sour dough baguettes and it was fun to dredged it in the juicy sauce there was plenty of mussels to share oh i forgot rot offers charcutier and cheese boards with looked great too overall we could have easily tried the typical limited burger bar food establishment but this place had a little variation i would try it again
313,had so much fun here went on a tuesday night for the 2 tacos and margs margaritas were strong and tasty the tacos were amazing the veggie one was surprisingly my favorite of all of them the place was pretty empty so it was nice to not be packed in our service was also amazing tyler or taylor i think was his name overall it was so fun and i can t wait to come back
314,food was good but service is extremely slow i have been here twice already and both time it took a long time to get our order don t come here starving
315,this was my family and i s first time at cheddars i heard it was good from my cousin but i didn t expect it to be this good the food was amazing the service at this restaurant was great my family and i are definitely gonna come back
316,had my graduation dinner here and everything from the service to the ambience to the food was stellar definitely recommend
317,bought a specialized type of cake for a holiday and it was delicious their pan dulce was fresh and delicious a bit more expensive than i am used to but worth it
318,always like trying to find a craft brewery whenever i travel stumbled upon the depot and was impressed great selection of beers and a cool atmosphere staff was friendly and helpful also came in on a saturday and got to take a look at there brunch menu 12 bucks for a 750 ml manmosa that s a steal anyways it s certainly a spot to stop by and have a relaxing time glad i found this place
319,our new favorite pizza place in reno the food was great the service was fast and the employees were super nice
320,this class is taught in a beautiful airy space and the teacher nina gives clear alignment based instructions as a yoga teacher i thoroughly appreciated her thoughtful instructions
321,hands down best sushi in town i order the salmon roll everywhere i go and this one blew my mind it was measurably better than any other one i have tried all the rolls are very fresh and packed with ample amounts of fish wonderful well balanced martinis crispy gyoza friendly staff highly recommended
322,great beignets and chicory coffee this location is closing it s doors after 40 years this will be my first and last time here i would have liked to have come back i think i am now addicted to beignets
323,super fast turnaround of my car but you d never know from looking at it they removed several scratches on my car from the drive through car wash mister i was so worried id was permanent and they got out everything i owe them big time they did such a nice job my boyfriend wanted his car detailed the next morning great place
324,one of the best places i tried while in nola came in for dinner and then came in again a couple of days later for happy hour i would highly recommend taking advantage of happy hour from 3 6 if you want to get some raw or fried oysters it is a great deal and there are drink specials as well also for dessert try the hummingbird cake
325,fantastic food prompt service and great bloody mary cinnamon roll french toast was possibly the most indulgent breakfast treat i ve had in years
326,another thai place in sb we had to go try it we went on a wednesday night and the store was adaquately packed we were seated right away and the service throughout the night wasn t that bad we ordered the creamy crab ragoons and the pad thai there are reviews here that were raving about the ragoons and honestly i liked them a lot they re pretty good however i usually wouldn t order it because the meal itself was so big the pad thai is good not the best i ve ever had in sb but it tastes just right ask for a spice rack to spice it up i really enjoyed it i also had the thai tea which came in little mason jars and was pretty inexpensive my items added up to 22 including tip but it was a good experience
327,pros great service and the staff is very friendly the decorations in the place is very modern and charming the food tastes good cons appetizer sizes are far too small and really expensive the ramen has a normal portion size but it still expensive to pay 14 dollars for soup
328,honest competent and their warranty is 100 good we had to take the old truck back three times to find a mysterious problem after those 4 visits the problems has been taken care of and the truck works perfectly now lots of stuff was replaced the charge after the original charge zero that is as it should be a warranty should mean that if the problem is not fixed they repair and replace parts until it is and that is exactly what they did i almost felt guilty that they had to do so many things and replace so many parts and that i paid nothing else but i m happy this is like the old days when people meant what they said and didn t try to fool you,friendly staff great coffee and snacks wine new art displays on the walls every month tables and lots of space we love this place thanks for making it homey and funky the not starbuck s small local human place
329,i was working in collegeville and couldn t leave work to get lunch so i searched for some restaurants that delivered very few restaurants offered lunch delivery and tony s menu looked decent i ordered an eggplant sandwich which came with a side of fries garlic cheese bread and a greek salad more food than i needed for lunch but there is a 15 minimum for delivery and i planned to save the salad and garlic bread for dinner the greek salad was really good all the ingredients were fresh and they didn t skimp on the feta the grape tomatoes were sweet and very flavorful the salad came with a garlic knot and it was delicious i had expected garlic cheese bread to be just one piece but it was a whole loaf sliced in half with loads of garlic really tasty the eggplant on the sandwich was very thin and not much of it the bread was thick the ratio of filling to bread was off definitely could have used more eggplant some mayo or sauce would have helped as it was rather dry delivery was very good the driver was very friendly and he was right on time
330,i m so happy i tried this place on a whim i love street style tacos but it s hard to find them on the southside for some reason the chips were so fresh the salsa had a creeping heat but not too spicy the sope was awesome and the corn tortilla for the taco was perfectly crispy on the outside our server was great she had the entire place to herself but we never had to wait for anything as she checked on us often i loved they offer a bigger kid menu than most my toddler had arroz con pollo they serve it with cheese on the chicken but i asked it be served on the rice instead and it wasn t an issue my little one inhaled it i can t wait to come back and try the rest of the items in the homemade section be sure to review the last page of the menu to see what else they make from scratch
331,i ve had the luxury of traveling all over this world and i ve been to some really great places and i find it so interesting that i can t find anything as good as what s in my own back yard f t longley is an outstanding example of what a pub should be like upon walking through the front door you ll be greeted with a friendly hello fast friendly service consistently good food and a guaranteed good time the staff is wonderful they all have great attitudes they are very friendly and johnny on the spot with their service kevin and andrea are fun engaging bartenders and their wait staff is over the top my servers name was amber and she was a rock star first class all the way put this place on your speed dial you will not be disappointed
332,this was the best restaurant our server cindy was amazing we had the sirloin ribs and prime rib we had reservations and we were seated immediately we definitely will return
333,update one of the co owners of spa aria read my review and contacted me she let me know that protocol whenever a customer expresses concern to any staff member at the spa is to contact her or the other co owner so that they can try to make it right but that this had not been done when i had expressed concern after my treatment she apologized for my experience especially that my concern had not been passed on to her when it happened and she offered to refund the cost of the eye treatment add on and 20 of the body scrub i appreciate that she took the time to reach out and make it right it restores my belief that this spa really does care about providing a good customer experience i still hope that they square their advertised treatment times with what is provided but appreciate that she took time out to reach out to me and that she was willing to adjust the cost to reflect the treatment times not provided i decided to get two services for my birthday i got a 60 minute sugar scrub and a 30 minute express facial with a 20 30 minute eye treatment add on first the body scrub lasted 45 minutes from start to finish including the time i was in the shower despite being advertised as a 60 minute treatment i expressed my confusion to the receptionist between appointments and she told me she would look into it then concerned about what had just happened i told my next woman who was providing a treatment how i had called ahead and was told that the eye treatment was an additional 20 30 minutes on top of the 30 minute mini facial and i wanted to confirm that she said that actually it was probably only 15 20 minutes on top in the end the 30 minute mini facial plus 20 30 minute add on eye treatment lasted 40 minutes so the add on was neither 20 30 minutes as advertised nor 15 20 minutes as stated but only ten when i spoke to the receptionist again when it was time for me to check out she sincerely apologized that my first treatment had only lasted 3 4 of the advertised time but did not offer to adjust the bill this was a truly disappointing service they should not advertise that services last longer than they actually do and it is disappointing that they did not stand behind their service and make any kind of adjustment for services not rendered the services themselves were fine the products didn t seem special and i didn t come out feeling as fresh as i usually do after a facial treatment as i write this i still can t believe i spent 50 on a ten minute eye treatment that consisted of putting one cream on and then holding ice over my eyes
334,attending the nbm big show convention center is always a great place to attend an event in the city big venue very clean and well kept for the most part most of the people working there are always pleasant it is places like this that make indy a great place to do business at

341,i try not to judge harshly when it comes to sushi since the bay area is especially spoiled anyhow i was looking to kick a sushi craving and was needing to try this place out it is average and i would go as far to say it is a first time sushi eater place cons it is so loud in the restaurant it is a hole in the wall with walls that won t absorb a single sound and this was when it wasn t jam packed i love shrimp but goddamn half the stuff on their menu is shrimp and cream cheese we didn t touch anything with cream cheese and i am glad we didn t also they put or garnished a lot of stuff with lemons lastly everything seemed to taste the same no matter what we ordered which made the ayce experience more of a aycs all you can stomach again it is okay service was reasonable and chefs and servers were nice but i will def be looking at other options for sushi in the future
342,good coffee on the pricier side but any alternative to starbucks in newtown is welcome fast and friendly service and lots of seating the ambience is pretty good for working but the wifi can be spotty or extremely slow
343,we ve been in the area for 2 months working and found this gem early on have had nothing but excellent food and service wtg guys this kind of business can be daunting

353,delicious delicious delicious our server was kind funny welcoming accommodating everything was absolutely perfect from the drinks to the bread to our main highly recommend and a great thank you to alex for making this experience so wonderful
354,this is a really good little place though the menu is really confused we both had the bibimbap and i just wish they would focus on that instead of the ton of random salads stopped here while traveling from tennessee to michigan and our food was ready in very little time the bibimbap was a good portion size with plenty of addins and a good sauce the waitress asked me if i really wanted to put that much sauce on of course i did bubble tea green was good as well and reasonably inexpensive for a large container
355,the food here is good but i feel it s just a little over priced for 2 adults and 2 kids i spent a little over 40 for 3 burgers and a hot dog i think it was a bit much
356,this is a great addition to the neighborhood great place for grooming and great prices
357,ordering paying is a bit of a cluster during lunch time but the warm chicken tinga bowl is delicious i will definitely be a frequent flyer at chopt

362,we had such a great time with mint julep the driver matt was very knowledgeable about the area and the distillery s we went to and just a fun guy to take us around got to and from the location in a timely manner the price was great for everything they had included with both tours and the luxury of not having to worry about transportation and lunch thank you for making part of our tennessee a memorable experience
363,got a reading made me sit up and think everything told to me was very wise and on point the actual shop is very small and can get tight with all of the tourists i wish they were located in atlanta or maybe biloxi because i have no intention of returning to new orleans i wonder if he does phone readings
364,service was slow we waited about 45 minutes to get our food while the wait staff sang and danced to ymca once the food got there it was good although most of my mussels were still shut and we couldn t open them a little overpriced but i guess you re paying for the fun atmosphere we were hungry and just wanted food
365,this was by far my favorite cuban sandwich of all the cubans i ve had to date we were treated to a free coffee after the meal as well as a spin of the wheel which led to a free dessert over all the experience was excellent i can t wait to go there again

374,i come here at least once a week i vary it up from salads to stir frys if you are a healthy person then you will appreciate it if you are use to salty fatty chemical food you won t like this most of the complaints talked about bland flavor dude it s a salad if you want more flavor out dressing on and salt pepper now i can t speak to the tofu or other proteins flavor so that s up for debate i think things that would help this place are fresh juices and smoothies like not in the mixer machine but they actually make the stuff in front of you also the staff never really talks to anyone so they need some social outreach or something for me though it s always a nice healthy lunch
375,best gelato we have ever had the staff is always friendly and courteous very creative and delicious combo of ingredients they have flavor combo you will not get anywhere else never had a flavor that was not perfection the bubble gum has hard gum balls i would caution for kids the dark chocolate is to die for combined with a fruit of your liking it was just amazing
376,i love this place i feel like their food is more flavorful than most of the places around staff is friendly price is very fair my go to is their chicken lo mein
377,ok if you love trying food this is your place to go the menu tasting is by far my favorite i love that you can try so many different things the chef does not disappoint with the selections i will say my all time favorite dessert is the pistachio flan that s a big deal coming from someone who loves chocolate

382,so this adorable little secret fancy parlor themed lounge was the 2nd stop on our anniversary night out in philly finding this secret gem is no joke if you are in the area of 20th and chestnut and its around 8 pm you may see people looking at the gps on their phones walking back and forth in front of a spice shop this may be your first hint that you are in the right place because there is no sign upon first impression after patting myself on the back for finding this hidey hole all the while pretending that i knew it was there the entire time duh to my hubs i am transported back in time to 1974 in my grandmothers front parlour couches with the wooden scrolls for arms portraits of unknown family members leering down at me from the walls and dusty knick knacks of mysterious origin we are the 2nd couple waiting for a seat the place is half full and the hostess if completely perplexed on how to seat 2 groups of 2 that want to sit separately she scans the room loveseats couches club chairs window seating the options are endlessly charming however beyond overwhelming for the hostess after the other couple decides to cross the street for an entree 1 tippling only serves munchies up to a certain time the hostess heaved a great sigh of relief and sat us in a quiet corner overlooking the bar the waitress was in no hurry to get us fed and out as some places are when she finally took our order and we got our drinks him a frothy gentlemans buck and for me dragons tear that khaleesi drink we settled in for people watching drinking and enjoying our time together there is a relaxed homey hang out awhile vibe to this place the decor matches the vibe of this joint sit down relax drink laugh drink a bit more really relax into that comfy chair oh there s the waitress well ok maybe one more of those dragon tear things all served in fun vintage glasses hubs and i were definitely the oldest in the room it reeks of yuppie and tory burch yet we had a great time drinking cocktails that went down way to easily guessing what the stories behind some of the groupings were and showing the young in s how to date after being married for 27 years 1 tippling is like being welcomed into a new yet familiar ritual fancy cocktails before or after dinner at your aunts house if you can find it go
383,took my 12 year old son yesterday for a cut walked in sat right down beca cut him and she was spectacular she recognized what the previous barber did last time he got a cut and offered suggestions on what she can do to correct his cowlick gave him a sharp curved part and perfect shape up of the sides asked our opinions before doing anything huge because he won t speak up if he s unhappy with what someone s doing in fear of hurting their feelings the other barbers chairs were all full every single client was happy and laughing the entire atmosphere was relaxed and laid back and the barbers themselves were clean and happy you can tell the barbers love their job and respect the company they work for and that s a huge deal
384,i was craving some good italian comfort food but didn t feel like venturing too far from my center city digs little nonnas was packed so of course i yelped it and came across this place pleasantly busy but still a number of tables open byob which is a huge bonus for me and pretty common at a lot of restaurants on pine score after a lengthy debate i got the chicken parm special and my fianc got the pasta carbonara chicken parm was massive the whole chicken breast moist and perfectly cooked carbonara was also amazing big pieces of bacon oh and they served bread knots with garlic infused olive oil with roasted garlic cloves in it also crazy bomb so long story short go here the food is delish and portions are huge so you can def share an appetizer and share an entree with another person and be stuffed by comparison much better than giorgio s on pine you won t be disappointed

390,looking for a funky little place to hang out this is it its got a huge wine selection and a cooler full of unique cheeses you can ask them to do a custom cheese plate with cheese you select or ask for the cheese plate of the day they also have fun bites of food like barbecue shrimp and bacon wrapped dates to accompany the live music in their cozy little courtyard this is more of a local gem than a tourist joint it is one of my favorite places to spend an evening

405,this place always has really great deals they hold all jewelry brands including alex and ani i usually come here for interview outfits or when the seasons change and need some cheap new fall clothes the only reason i m giving four stars is because the store is always a little messy the unorganization is a bit overwhelming and you have to loom hard to find the great deals but each trip i always leave with something and i leave feeling satisfied
406,if you ve found terra malia designs look no further we hired terra for our wedding a few months ago after seeing some of her work firsthand among friends and family not surprisingly terra blew us all away from the floral arrangements and general decor to the intricately designed pieces for the wedding party to the main wedding ceremony arch everything was stellar the colors were vibrant and set the wedding venue on flower fire guests couldn t stop commenting on the beauty on top of terra s natural design skills and those of her team terra went above and beyond to meet our needs her customer service was top notch for us and you can bet it ll be the same for you and if her customer service don t get ya her warmth and laughter will when you hire tmd you ll find more than a vendor you ll probably find a long term friend
407,2 words the cure i ended up here after a night of one too many drinks it happens a friend recommended this place for a hang over cure she was not mistaken after reviewing their menu which seemed a bit obnoxious i m talking quirky names that require you read the description to be able to decipher what you re eating i settled on the sandwich with an egg on it im a sucker for a runny egg on just about anything messy eggs bacon mozzarella jalapeo aioli on toasted cuban bread this holy grail of a sandwich is called the cure i have been back a few times to this establishment just for this sandwich the mimosas too oh yea they have liquor so you can totally have drinks here the ambience is very chill there are a good amount of tables inside and bar seating no outside seating i have been here on a sunday for brunch and found it to be pretty family kid friendly the whole place and most of the staff is painfully hipster but it works the bathrooms are clean and there is a small back patio with mural art
408,awesome spot with delicious slurpy booze aka daquiries it s all about the pims cup stacey was a great waitress we ll be back for sure
409,i love everything about tired hands and look forward to going every time i am home my mom first noticed the long lines of people outside of the original location and we were curious about what could draw such a crowd after going once we knew it would become a regular spot for our family the beers are funky and flavorful the original location is tiny while this new location is huge i would recommend the original location for a small group and the new location for a larger party

421,if you love aesthetics and are a fan of art then plat 99 is the contemporary fit for you i m from la and had the pleasure to stay at the alexander hotel and this bar plat 99 is apart of it the mixologists are amazing yes i said it mixologists and these guys know how to make a drink not only are they good at it but each individual participated and added their own style of cocktails to the menu if you ever stay at the hotel or just wanna grab a drink definitely stop in because you won t be disappointed there s hardly a wait never crowded and very intelligent and properly mannered 5 stars is definitely what they deserved and would say more if it were an option
422,my boyfriend and went for the first time i was excited because i have only heard great things about this restaurant we were not disappointed everything was great we ordered the cauliflower and chicken wings for an appetizer and the chicken beef and queso empanadas and the churros for dessert the drinks were amazing i had the margarita we will definitely be back

424,a delicious italian byo that takes reservations can accommodate large parties and caters to gluten free and vegan diets say whaaaaaaat i had been wanting to try bocconcini ever since it opened as i had heard nothing but rave reviews finally got to with the fam on a frigid winter s night which of course goes perfectly with a bottle of red and some italian am i right i should mention the staff here went above and beyond even calling us back several times squeezing us in last minute on a busy friday evening despite having two incredibly large parties that night highly recommend reservations oh and they will close down for private functions in case anyone is looking to throw a party of any kind be prepared for a more lively environment if they do have parties however a smidge loud nothing we personally minded 20 gratiuity is automatically added to tables of six or more our bottle was opened immediately after being seated and we were presented with knotted rolls and garlic oil right away our server jenny was incredible through the entire meal quick with ingredient lists recommendations and water refills friendly and efficient we started with the arincini which were huge and the cauliflower both very well received the cauliflower despite being very lightly breaded was indeed vegan no egg wash it was served with a tasty perfectly spicy fra diablo for dipping i had this as part of my main meal and couldn t get enough of it i ate a ton and still had some to take home incredible side there s also a vegan pie brussels and zucchini which are all dairy free too can t wait to return and try them as well the table also ordered chicken parm pie which was a bit more than individually sized the penne vodka with seasonal vegetables and the porcini ravioli the ravioli was a fan favorite and said to be one if not thee best mushroom ravioli we ve ever had a must try we also couldn t help but noticed the insane towering impressive slice of lasagna our neighbor was diving into wow the creative slices at the front were pretty tasty looking also i personally loved seeing chef crystal fox formerly of giorgio on pine their sister shop just next door behind in the semi open kitchen doing her thing with her pig tattoo and all the random placed piggies throughout the space didn t go unnoticed by me cute great for date night family dinners celebrations slices for a quick lunch dinner to go or even delivery uber minor complaint which may seem so silly to some would be the stained dropped ceiling and the overflowing trash can in the restroom this is me being very picky but i couldn t help but notice either excited to return i would uber it here parking isn t the easiest
425,after checking out the long line at ruby slipper we were happy to find creole great regular breakfast plus creole favorites i ll pass on the crawdad cakes next time but my brother s grillade was great very good and quick service
426,debated between a 3 and a 4 but the good pushed it up the food was phenomenal get the catfish get the pork ribs the twice cooked wings were omg just amazing what brought this place down from a 5 is that the service was not the best our drinks were made incorrectly i love a strong drink and rarely turn one down but the drink i received was just nasty it was a friday night and the bar got busy quickly but i overheard the customers next to me complain about their drink as well we will definitely be back regardless because the food is really good
427,dmitri s is our family go to restaurant as we have been coming for the past 15 years the food has been consistent always fresh we never miss soft shell crab season with them the sauted mussels are like no other the hummus hands down best i ve ever had we frequent the best restaurants in philadelphia this is definitely one of our favorites the restaurant has servers that have been there for years and that s just icing on the cake we love danielle always a comfort eating here oh and don t forget the greek coffee and rice pudding the best
428,my boyfriend and i tried the love for the first time saturday evening of memorial day weekend the city is usually pretty empty on holiday weekends but love was still packed nothing on the menu really spoke to me as something i just had to have but he had really been wanting to try this place i m glad i listened we started with the duck salad fantastic we had the lobster spaghetti and the crab pasta special as entrees both good but the lobster spaghetti was the winner we also finished with a cheese plate and the cookie tray i was skeptical that a cheese plate could be 20 good but it absolutely was definitely a pricier dinner but all high quality ingredients and worth the money good service as well paced the different courses well and check on us just enough will definitely be back
429,jesus this place is a sleeper the food life changing the service couldn t be any sweeter the fried pickles are so good they disappears before i could take a picture
430,this is becoming our favorite breakfast place they have the best breakfast food around hands down i always order the corned beef hash with 3 eggs and split a side of home fries with my wife two things i would approve on is service and cleanliness the service is just a little slower than it should be it takes to long to get a coffee refill and way to long to get the check especially when your just sitting there with an empty coffee cup the second thing is it needs to be a little cleaner inside the dust on several surfaces is deep and you can tell hasn t been cleaned in a while the fans light fixtures and blinds were just piled with dust waiting to fall in your food everything else was clean the food is so good you can excuse the slower service despite the dust this is still on the top of the list for favorite diners
431,honesty hour we went out in nashville after 10pm apparently there are limited options at that time when it isn t the weekend we decided to try out this place after walking to a couple of other places that were not like their descriptions this place has a nice ambience nice staff and a ton of beers and ciders on tap the prices weren t bad for the drinks or beer between 5 8 for the beer cider around 10 12 for cocktails oh and the kitchen closes at 11 now on to the food we got the burger and the chimichanga we were splitting them so we went for something a little different with the chimichanga we also got the cheesesteak egg rolls sounds fantastic right unfortunately the burger was the only highlight everything else got a huge fail the chimichanga was super soggy the rice and beans were ok the cheesesteak egg rolls were just bad no taste at all now on to our drinks we first ordered their take on a margarita they used silver tequila so it had a very heavy tequila taste it was ok he wound up with the punch it was ok mind you we were traveling all day and ate everything so it was edible all and all if you need somewhere to go late then try it just stick to very regular things the staff is nice so that is worth a visit based on that alone
432,this is a tradition in the medford nj area christmas light display is awesome excellent quality food esp produce fresh corn in the summer and their pies prices are high but my family is always excited when i bring a johnson pie to an event very family oriented place always has enough cashiers for quick check out
433,best ice cream in reno my favorite is the matcha ube swirled the inside is super cute too

435,i wish i could give more than five stars these guys help you out in a jiffy super friendly good work
436,expect a long wait period these monster pizzas are made to order with limited oven space plan to arrive before you are ravenous come in to place your order and sit down to have a drink or 2 while you wait an hour or two let the anticipation build your hunger or call ahead if you don t want to wait establishment has been remodeled throughout to include a nice patio set up we almost left thinking we walked into the wrong place what hasn t changed the service and the food the toppings were 2 fingers deep and cooked to perfection there was no muddling of flavors and the crust was flaky crisp bring friends these pies are made to feed the masses we were a party of 4 adults and took home half a pizza there is a service model here and patrons are generally aware of how it works without having to ask or be told don t expect to be fawned over it s just not that kind of environment the service is friendly however and the set up is efficient edit the 5th star was almost granted here i was at a 4 5 and rounded down i might bump it up when i eat the other half for breakfast i just hafta see how it re heats
437,first timer nice clean modern establishment great experience with cecilia she s amazing sweet quick and genuinely makes you feel as comfortable as you possibly can feel while bare and spread eagle
438,we booked our morning swamp tour online pretty easy to do upon arrival we parked in their free lot checked in at their front office gift shop and waited on the patio for our tour time led by captain chris we ventured out to see gators egrets and trash pandas the pigs boars didn t want to cooperate that day while taking in the lush swampy landscape captain was engaging fun and knowledgeable accommodating to all in our group which included children and a bachelorette party trying to explain gator sex with children present is no small feat
439,charming hotel the rooms are charming and cozy i loved the fireplace the bathroom was spacious and clean very nice tub breakfast was delicious and the wine and cheese were a nice perk shortly after check in the only things that weren t so great were the extremely noisy revellers outside the window the oilers had just won that went on until well past 2 am no fridge i am one of those people who always needs cold drinks especially water during the night and we often have leftovers from meals some medications also need refrigeration this would be the only change i d make to the rooms
440,thai legacy is amazing tom yum soup with coconut was incredible watch out for the red peppers pad thai was great with a lot of chicken and a large portion yellow curry was the best we have ever had great service and reasonably priced i can t wait to go back
441,got there right when it opened phone was fixed in less than an hour i hope i don t need to use them again but if i do then i know my phone will get fixed
442,things have changed taco prices are higher 2 tecates are gone at some point the menu stopped advertising mahi tacos and now just says fish and the quality has noticeably dropped my last taco was fishy tasting the bad kind of fishy understuffed and lopsided the stuff was in one corner and i had to shove it around and get everything all messy in order for it not to all fall out i m sad
443,enjoy fishing with hubbard s so much we ve gone 2 times in less than a month the captain and crew do a great job finding fish and helping with fish and issues with fishing gear each time we ve gone they have recommended which day would be best as far as calmness both days the water was calm and perfect

447,this place was good food overpriced for the type of service you get and it was hot inside the restaurant
448,we ve had this bookmarked for awhile but finally went for a late lunch today and so glad we did everything was delicious the soups were amazing hubby had kozy which is lamb based soup and i had the lentil soup the soup and hot tea come with the meal as well as a small salad the chicken kabob was so flavorful and well prepared and came with a generous serving of rice i had the kubah halab rice balls filled with meat onions and spices so good mom is the cook and after we asked if we could take her home with us she came out to meet us very nice people we will be back

450,great selection ordered the happy herd which was more than enough for 5 people food was a bit cold but overall great taste will definitely be coming back
451,food was decent i ordered the chicken with potatoes the potatoes tasted weird and had like a weird tangy flavor chicken was dry and salty waiter was charming but bad with filling up water he would fill one cup up and leave the others empty for no reason also had a very small selection though i tried my brothers hamburger and it was outstanding children may not like this place but it ll be fine for adults unless you re picky
452,sukho thai is one of those dive y places that is a hidden gem you don t know about it unless you ve been with someone else it s very unassuming since they outside looks like it s an old dry cleaner drive through attached to the co kart place looks are deceiving my husband used to work for gaylord so he would come here for lunch all the time and got hooked the place is run by ms kim and her son alert do not come here when you are already hungry the service is very slow because it s just the two of them i learned my lesson the hard way on this expect at least 30 mins of waiting for your food to come out if you want to avoid this order food to go the food here is great i ve always been pleased with the quality and the flavor the meat is not fatty which i love and the veggies are fresh there s nothing worse than a bunch of gristle in your food in my opinion overall the quality is good and the owners are sweet i will keep coming here another word to the wise they are closed on sundays
453,a happy accident found on our way to another restaurant in clearwater beach good was excellent and i would recommend this place to anyone pasdoing by our shrimp burgers were delicious with toppings of avocado tomato lattice and a really great sauce adrian our waiter was very helpful and provided excellent service i would recommend this place to anyone passing thru clearwater
454,peppermill has done it again with service and accommodations that are second to none gaming at the mill i only play 1 dollar or 25 cent slots seems to provide better outcomes and i know reno spent a lot here and found the peppermill is the best food is some of the best and reasonably priced
455,our daughter and family moved from seattle to sacramento and had a terrible experience they weren t sure they would ever see their belonging again that was until they were put in touch with rose olsen from olsen and fielding mayflower immediately the moving van with their items showed up we decided to follow them to sacramento and didn t think twice about which company to use rose olsen was held our hand throughout the entire move we managed to fill 13 units making this a large move we had wonderful movers in seattle and the same in sacramento all the while rose was helping us out answering questions and offering encouragement in addition to providing a skilled and experienced staff if you want a trouble free experience olsen and fielding mayflower are the people to call ask for rose
456,the pancake plates are definitely a good value under 10 for the peach and the banana bread pancakes however we did not feel that the pancakes were special or worth the wait the line wrapped around the restaurant even at noon on a wednesday i wish the pancakes were fluffier and that the banana ones had actual slices of bananas with the plate we thought the quality was on par with ihop the sausage links were clearly not made in house frozen service was friendly though and the price was right for a diner breakfast
457,very crowded place food was ok waiters were friendly pork chop was not cooked properly shrimp po boy was good the building is old but beautiful pricing was acceptable
458,can t say much wrong with this place they have many donut choices and are always making them fresh they also tend to make the same ones everyday so something you like is always there i love the maple bars and the old fashioned ones donut holes are also great grab a drink milk or some coffee and you ve got a pretty amazing treat on your hands because they re fresh cooked which tastes better anyway you want to check this place early after a certain time they stop making them to avoid a lot of day old donuts the donuts are great and cheap so pick up a few
459,visited burger study during the 2018 winter devour got seated immediately at 6 30pm on a thursday without reservations very impressive we were given water quickly and placed our orders within 5 minutes the staff was quick friendly professional and attentive my friend and i split the devour menu so we got an appetizer and two burgers for 30 we selected the beer cheese tater tots for our appetizer and they were amazing added twist broken pretzel pieces we also both got the stanford turkey burger without sprouts with the cucumber tomato salad as a side the burger was absolutely delicious except the mayonnaise i was not a fan overall experience was great and i will definitely consider visiting again when i m craving a burger,convenient location in nora reliable and friendly service standard menu overall good quality food and service one of my go to chipotles,this is my go to nail salon as i live and work on the north side of indianapolis i have never had to wait more than 20 minutes i ve had several gel manicures regular manicures and pedicures usually i m very satisfied but this last time i went my gel nail color has become discolored after 5 days very frustrating however my experiences are always so great that i m confident they will be able to assist me with fixing this current issue update just went again and had excellent service

462,i started with caleco s on laclede and continued to follow it the owner manager is very passionate about this establishment and i greatly applaud jim he brings a personal flare to the place you won t find at any other restaurant i wish him further luck and success on a st louis landmark
463,we came for dinner they had a special of the day the lobster seafood pot it was on sale for 25 normally 39 we both tried it the seafood was too soft it must have been in a big pot and simmering for a while we also had the octopus appetizer it was also to soft the cooks need to do a better job on the seafood the restaurant is located adjoining to a hotel it was clean with a large bar with one tv don t think we would be going back
464,everything we ve had here has been delicious my favorites are the steamed dumplings egg drop soup and boba teas
465,had to meet a friend on the east side and needed to eat we chose phan s after reading yelp reviews thank you trusty yelpers phan greeted us while we were checking out the menu she invited us to sit down and she would bring us drinks that was unexpected for a restaurant inside the mall she brought our drinks out and took our orders she apologized that it might take some time because she let her help go and she makes everything fresh we weren t in a hurry and i was happy to wait for fresh food we started with the fresh spring rolls every bite was exactly as i had hoped the peanut sauce topped them off nicely too i had the pad ke mao hope i spelled that right big flat noodles with bok choy and sauce yum my husband ordered the ginger beef she asked how hot 1 5 she was surprised when he said 4 but she seemed to be happy with his choice he was also happy with his choice even though his face was completely red our friend had the house fried rice he made sure to finish every single satisfying bite she refilled our drinks a couple more times and told us to let her know when we were ready to pay but no rush she told us on the way out that this was her first restaurant and she hoped we all loved it we definitely did all my east side friends get in there and eat sorry that there are no photos we were too busy devouring every last morsel
466,they did an excellent job of fixing my ipad cover glass very happy with the service
467,i recently started becoming a regular here i normally try to see yu for my services the salon is clean and she does a great job i prefer to make appointments vs walking in so my one issue is that they don t really have a good system in place for managing appointments i called several weeks ago to schedule an appointment 3 weeks out and was asked to call back in a couple of weeks to schedule the appointment the time before that i made an appointment while i was in the salon already and saw them write it down on some little piece of paper i recommend a better system particularly in a computer because they can easily miss out on business this way
468,food service seating was all great i do think it s stingy for restaurants to charge a 1 for a side of sauce
469,food at hipcity is always pretty good the nugs are good still wish they would offer a potatoe form for fries as well as sweet potatoes are not my thing great design inside one of the bigger hipcityveg s i have been in
470,i love carmelita s the restaurant is nothing fancy and the food is nothing fancy they just serve solid home cooking at good prices their combo plates are great i usually go for a chille relleno enchilada and mini chimi with rice and beans for around 12 this is a bargain and can feed two people the chille relleno is solid as is the chimi the brown enchilada sauce can be different for some tastes but i also enjoy it ask for the homemade hot chille and you are good to go
471,popped in somewhat last minute with a table for 4 and they were able to get us a table within a reasonable wait for no reservations which had me pleased right at the start considering it was a saturday night we had a drink and an appetizer up at the bar first excellent bartender and crab cakes dinner was excellent steaks lobsters and sides prepared perfectly with a very attentive staff our bill was almost 400 however given the quality food and service as well as the proximity to our hotel keystone i can t complain thanks for a lovely saturday night
472,great food great service will definitely come back the next time i m in new orleans the alligator po boy was amazing
473,loved penang during my time in boston so i was excited to see one in philly s chinatown quality of the food was about the same too the menu is fairly diverse and offers a variety of thai malaysian indian and chinese dishes definitely try the roti canai probably the most ordered item in the restaurant you get a huge blanket of roti wrapped artfully into a sculpture it is only a couple millimeters thick and strikes a perfect balance between crispiness and chewiness it goes great with the accompanying curry sauce which also contains some pieces of chicken and potato i also tried out the indian mee goreng on my most recent visit it certainly had a lot of taste and went well with the other dishes i ordered but a warning that there is a strong seafood taste they use dried squid sauce another favorite of mine is the beef rendang the beef is super tender and the curry sauce it is cooked in is delicious tastes of coconut milk and lemongrass with hints of cinnamon order a bowl or two of rice to go with this finally i would order the spareribs malaysian style these pork shortribs are lightly fried but the meat is juicy and goes really well with the accompanying sweet and sour sauce service overall is quite good and the food comes out at a reasonable pace this place does get crowded though
474,i ll be honest i did not want to try this place because i am a burger maven and i have had burgers in what are reported to be some of the best burger joints in america and have been disappointed and i saw the review that said their burger here was burned but they have changed from a pan fry to a grill and i had an impossible burger that was superb and with the recommended follow your heart vegetarian cheese the burger was cooked perfectly medium with grilled onions and a side order of salad that had organic romaine lettuce everything was excellent including the warm and gracious owners lucy and her daughter ashley i ll be back
475,my meal was tre delish this is one of those places you might be inclined to overlook but you are missing a real treat for starters the price is reasonable i got the chicken with mushrooms and cognac sauce oh man it was good the reason for four stars rather than five is that one of my table mates was not as satisfied as me he ordered the lasagna which was loaded in meat and fewer noodles than one might expect with this dish one appetizer we got that i highly recommend is the bruschetta such a fresh starter for my meal i ended with cheesecake great meal and super price we will definitely return
476,we were supposed to wait 45 minutes but it was only a 20 min wait the service was quick and the rustic environment was mixed with a sporty vibe the food was very good and moderately priced the pickle chips were really good will definitely return edit returned several times since the service is relatively slow even when there aren t many people here seems like something has changed definitely not on the a game with speed,we were supposed to wait 45 minutes but it was only a 20 min wait the service was quick and the rustic environment was mixed with a sporty vibe the food was very good and moderately priced the pickle chips were really good will definitely return
477,it was okay but nothing special for the price a dozen oysters were 36 dollars and they were incredibly small they were stuck to the shell so you had to loosen the little guys up with your fork or they wouldn t come out the wings were okay but the portion of vegetables was very small i had 2 pieces of cauliflower and one green bean
478,i thought my experience here was so exceptionally awesome that i had no choice but to leave a yelp review which i ve never done before but once i read the reviews i realized my experience was no exception or unique at all this is the norm here amazing ice cream samples and service the best will be back often
479,really cute cozy place the chocolate gelato was good and it was nice enough to sit on the back patio the gal at the counter wasn t exactly friendly which was awkward i appreciate the bin for the plastic cups and spoons to recycle them,really cute cozy place the chocolate gelato was good and it was nice enough to sit on the back patio the gal at the counter wasn t exactly friendly which was awkward i appreciate the bin for the plastic cups and spoons to recycle them
480,excellent carrot ginger dressing salad one of the best tempura ive ever tasted including dipping sauce nigiri sushi pieces were small but very fresh and tasty rice was a bit dry and some were hard as if it was old but tasty nonetheless excellent meal overall especially for chinese chefs looking forward to trying their chinese food i was salivating at the other diner s chinese dishes i would definitely come back perhaps on a regular basis
481,we love livery recently had dinner for my birthday there and they we super accommodating for us after our party ballooned from 12 to 16 our food is always great there and the carriage house margarita hits the spot best part even with a large party split appetizers and people moving around like crazy all the checks were right the first time and all the staff are great thank you to everyone there for maintaining a great standard of service and quality
482,i ve been trying to eat my way around the world here quesadillas aren t quite enough food for me a wrap is just right and chos aka nachos i typically need a to go box very clean store consistent food and friendly service i think the far east dishes are a little plain my favorites are the pangea feeds 2 the buffalo wrap and thai peanut but i ve enjoyed nearly the entire menu at some point
483,last week me and one of my friends were looking for a place to eat at around 3 00pm and we found that everything was closed or didn t open till 4 00pm we went into biscuit love because the door was open and asked if they were open and he said no sorry after checking all of the other restaurants and finding them closed the gentleman from biscuit love got our attention and handed us a bag of wonderful treats and 2 coffees it was so sweet and nice of him i will for sure go back and recommend the place to anyone
484,i think the experience was good my steak was a little under cooked but it was juicy the crew was very helpful and nice it was busy so the ambiance was a little hectic the reason i didn t give it a 5 star a little too expensive my steak cost 23 and i was expecting it to be a little bigger my wife had half a rack of ribs and my son a burger everything tasted great but i felt over charged they don t offer prime rib disappointing i just don t like paying for bone,this place is unique and amazing if you have ever been in a berlin cafe in germany this place will bring back memories i was stationed in germany and was lucky enough to experience the berlin wall coming down they have a amazing selection of wine and beer on draft if you enjoy sauerkraut potato salad wurst and schnitzel this is the place please visit little piece of paradise trust me you will be pleasantly surprised
485,this is just a shoutout to devyn a truly phenomenal hairstylist i did a terrible job of explaining how i wanted my hair cut and she still gave me by far the best hair cut i ever had she is simply incredible
486,a safe walk from downtown rewarded with interesting views lighting and great cocktails worth checking out
487,i love their donuts first tasted them in duck nc so glad they re here the kids working there did a great job pretty darn quick considering they re assembled
488,awesome cinnamon rolls i highly recommend the cinnamon roll with pumpkin frosting when in season if you don t like overly sweet then don t go for the ones with a ton of toppings the simple ones are the perfect sweetness for me vegan family members have even been able to enjoy them though i would ve never guessed that the cinnamon rolls were vegan
489,two things best shrimp n grits i ve ever had i live in tx and best pecan pie i ve ever had literally melts in your mouth that is all
490,top notch street tacos great service and hand made horchata made this a top notch stop
491,today s lunch was a visit to ted peters my wife had a wonderful fish spread sandwich along with an excellent german potato salad i had a bowl of the manhattan clam chowder and potato salad soup was a bit bland which i spiced up with hot sauce and lots of pepper the outdoor location was noisy as usual complimented by bulldozer work next door at a construction site despite this the food was good as was the service
492,our first time at brick mortar small space cozy food was very good nice wine selection started with the poutine wow two of us had the espresso ribbed short rib we were told it was the first dish chef designed for the restaurant excellent teder flavorful and not overpowered with sauce polenta cake reflect combo one in our party had short ribs over noodles very good one ordered the b m burger fantastic with the truffle fries will return when back in st pete
493,this is such a gem for brunch my friends and i must ve gotten lucky to have gone early on a weekday morning no wait and not too crowded the special menu changes everyday and sounds fantastic i had my eyes set on the goat cheese spinach and caramelized onion omelet and it did not disappoint i replaced fruit with chip fries while my friends ordered shoestring fries both are amazing and what makes it better is that they re served with a spicy aioli sauce i tried their spider drink which was nothing short of delicious i will definitely be returning to try other things on the menu great food and great service
494,this is my go to nail salon in reno they are always very nice and they do a great job i tend to go right after work around 5pm and i never have to wait longer than 10 minutes their prices are average but they have a loyalty card so your 10th visit is free
495,stopped here based on the reviews service was good as were the prices food was served fast and was good this is much better than chain area mexican restaurants in the area i would go here again before chipotle or the other chain down the street
496,went here for my brother and my birthday our group was a table of 12 on a saturday night we had great service great food and great drinks we had the shrimp tacos pork and beans both burger options filet ordered and we all loved out meals definitely will be coming back as often as possible
497,my experience was not bad like the other reviews food was fresh portions were generous toppings were plentiful salsa bar was fresh and everything was clean they have lots of variety for toppings it is too noisy from the music and the speakers are right above the line area so it is hard to place your order there is no reason to avoid the location as far as i ve experienced we ve come here about 4 5 times
498,i ran into two friends who were on their way to pizzeria vetri and i tagged along it was a short walk from the hotel it was a warm spring day and the outside seating was full so we took seats inside the wood fired oven was in the rear center of the room the server arrive quickly dropping off menus and taking our drink orders a nice selection of beer and wine is available as well as cocktails we each ordered a small pizza i opted for a margherita while my friends got a pepperoni and a sausage the pizzas came out in minutes thin neapolitan pizza crispy crunchy with a few charred spots on the risen crust excellent pizza with plenty of toppings if i lived here i d be a regular

504,delicious food i personally loved it i was surprised to see 3 star reviews here but when i read it i understood the reason everyone loved the place the food but the prices let me tell you something if i don t want to spend 200 for dinner i don t go to barkley prime if i want to get a good quality lunch i don t expect it to be less than 25 unfortunately life is expensive here in philadelphia especially for people with good tastes and yes you have to pay for a good quality meals so if you are aware of that i m sure you will totally enjoy suraya
505,the food was great the service was quick and the drinks were delicious the servers have tablets now and it makes the food come out faster someone actually brought drinks to our table while our server was still telling us about appetizers how cool
506,kimpton hotel group is always fabulous my first stay was in seattle at the monaco in 2002 and i have also stayed at the hotel rouge in dc this was a surprise treat for me as i had purchased vip tickets to a concert at the foundry club within the confines of the fillmore a review on that later everyone was so dang nice sean the valet was the first person i met and he was so awesome we arrived at around 1230 and they allowed an early check in the room was neat we had been selected as the vip guest of the day and we were treated to a bottle of wine and a cheese plate wow anyway after the show we stopped by for a drink at the red owl tavern and my friend actually met someone at the bar who he basically grew up with in oregon she had been at the concert too the next day we found out our check out time was noon but we packed up and left our bags at the front desk while we went to independence hall and visited the liberty bell and then went to get a philly cheese steak i have never had one really a great city and a great hotel thank you for such a nice experience
507,be prepared for a long wait during lunch food was so good and fresh very accommodating switching proteins for me from meat to tofu love this place i order more from uber eats than dining in here and the food is always delicious and consistent
508,i need rehab i need rehab i order 2 original banana puddings on uber eats every weekend it is consistently delicious the best i ve had thus far
509,what a great crew had my wedding there and it was perfect leila frankie great job couldn t have asked for more
510,amazing bakery as you walk in you get a draft of fresh baked bread one of the best guatemalan bakeries within california and nevada i recommend you also try the tamales
511,i ve now been to margaritaville in nashville and the bahamas i enjoyed both places even though the menu could use some refreshing from time to time the only reason i didn t mark this as four stars i don t know where they buy the shirts they sell but the one from the bahamas had a hole in the back within two months and the one from nashville i noticed before washing it the first time for the money i spent on it i wasn t happy with it but the spirits were great
512,the guy working there was very helpful and the women making them was very sweet we loved the beach and legend aa bowl and ate the bowl clean you ll definitely want to try this
513,ordered a large pizza 1 2 pepperoni and 1 2 cheese the crust is not too thin and not oily at all i subtracted 1 star because i found it a little too salty otherwise not bad
514,i took my girlfriend here and she got food poisoning lmao but the food was bomb tho
515,amazing ambiance and flavorful aromatic coffee i ordered americano and my friend got latte both perfectly delicious cute little spot with eclectic decor which features local artist s work where you can relax study read a book or get some work done
516,great service and ambiance you have indoor and outdoor seating area waiters are well trained and very very friendly and attentive we had the eggs benedict s with lamb and the burrito together with the feta cheese dip a must ac is a bit cold everything else is perfect
517,good hours complimentary beverages friendly service my only request is to be a little more sanitary ex please don t touch phones and tools with same gloves as being used on wet pedicure feet and for more modern on trend colors
518,nice atmosphere delicious beautiful plates good service smaller servings than expected for the price but again delicious
519,the food was pretty tasty nothing outstanding though it reminds me of any mediterranean food truck that i ve been to it s a nice late night spot definitely hits the spot at the end of the night to me the amount of food you get for the price could be improved but i would not say that i feel ripped off the amount of food you get is fair but i think it d be easier to justify if you got a little more there s plenty of seating despite being near a whole bunch of bar club scenes once you re inside it s easy to take a break and have a nice conversation it is all very clean and well kept the servers are quick and friendly when i went there were only two guys working but they weren t busy so it didn t take too long the entire restaurant is very dimly lit and the atmosphere is a bit of a hodgepodge of things on one wall there is a mural of outer space and the music that plays seems to have no rhyme or reason to it it s a bit of a strange place but i would definitely go back
520,you will feel like you were transplanted suddenly to europe i love mazzaro great place to come to fill up your fridge with healthy and not so healthy goodies fair prices and excellent wines and cheese heaven
521,went here thinking it was another cracked egg in daytona beach shores both are awsum huge menue started off with strawberry and mango marmossas split a florida omlett then traditional waitress was perfect only stopped a couple of times decorations very cool and thought provoking
522,great wine selection and great service highly recommend shrimp and grits they have a very good dessert selection as well
523,the service always seems to be slow or in different the hostess was by the kitchen to keep warm she asked if we wanted to sit at the bar even though we said to seat us away from the door while sitting 4 tables were left dirty for 10 15 minutes by the time we left the food was just placed on the table even though one person has a food allergy i ve been to all of the bailey concepts were great service not sure if we will return
524,ohhhh where to begin this place is an american treasure it s like stepping back in time warm romantic and unique the food is as unique as the restaurant i have been to this tavern for a meal during the day and night the only thing i would suggest but it s not the fault of the tavern is at night you might want to put some bug spray on if you want to linger outside after all you are out in the beautiful woods
525,honestly came here with the folks and was taken away by the nostalgia so glas i got to come in and see all the forrest gump references also i got a shrimp platter to kind of get a feel for the place they were surprisingly really well done this place is like the swiss chalet of all things shrimp we dont have one in toronto so it was great to try out the gift shop was nice as well
526,working with the company was a stress free experience kim worked with me from start to finish they replaced five glass windows in a timely manner you want to know the best part very reasonable would recommend and use them again
527,this place was unreal the chips and queso were so warm and delicious the burrito i got with fried shrimp and cauliflower in it sounds weird but it was incredible the food was so flavorful and such a good mix of tastes the churros were to die for the staff were all super friendly and nice if you are looking for some amazing mexican food go here,i thought this place was pretty good we started off with a small cheese pizza to share which i enjoyed and found to be good wood fire for this area as my meal i had the penne pesto which was just alright kind of lacked flavor but was a decent portion size my boyfriend also said his pasta dish lacked flavor but he liked the pizza i liked the bread that came with the food a lot the prices were good and the staff were very nice
528,great addition to the neighborhood friendly employees light and open space and an extensive menu bonus for cycle beer on draft i haven t tried the pizza yet but everyone i have spoken to has given it positive reviews enjoy the ability to share small plates and try various items
529,i d been dying to eat here i had the tostones rellenos and ordered the hemingway cuban with garlic tostones to take home everything was amazing this is my favorite spot at armature works
530,great quick dinner got the pulled pork and fried egg totally delicious great french onion soup too
531,very nice deco friendly staff took a little staycation sometimes u need that room since and clean had a wonderful view went shopping at the fashion mall nice
532,excellent food excellent service what an amazing staff we came in during mardi gras at happy on the parade route the resturant was sooooo busy they had every excuse to drop the ball but instead amili sp and jamie made us feel so special they treated us like kings and queens they made my 80 year old old man feel special for his 1st mardi gras hats of the ownership and leadership of this super awesome resturant your commitment to quality and service excellence is refreshing shout out to the most amazing bar staff in all of nola you guys are awesome definitely the highlight of the trip we ll be back
533,i m a regular here and for good reason the food is excellent and they service is great they are very friendly and always make sure you leave with the special sauce the sauce is amazing their pizza easily beats the chains in the area i highly recommend napoli
534,omg had dinner last night and the food service and manager annmarie were amazing there was a wait for 10 or so minutes but that s i guess the price you pay on a friday night at 7p the wait was worth it the two italian dishes we ordered were hot and better than expected and although it was crowded it still felt intimate we will be back next month again and this time we will share a plate 2 50 and save room for dessert if i could rate six stars i would have
535,so different from any other boutique in new orleans the perfect place to shop for dresses and accessories i feel like every other boutique carries the same stuff but babe is refreshing and unique the owner is so nice and personable and really creates a very enjoyable shopping experience
536,my wife and i stopped by on our last day in town to check out some voodoo dolls the store has a rustic shop feel straight out of a movie you walk in and instantly smell the incense and see the tarot card room off to the side they have a great selection of dolls and other voodoo products the shop owner was very helpful in suggesting some incense and oils for dealing with specific issue as as well,the beignets are fantastic and the wait was virtually nonexistent i highly recommend venturing here instead of wasting time in line for the slightly more popular places in the french quarter i also had the crawfish bread which was not so good the crawfish and cheese on top made the bread very soggy
537,great brunch spot i ordered the liquid gold juice a great mixture of pineapple mango orange and ginger mmmmm
538,the wk cheesesteak was fabulous a lil salty the rueben cheesesteak was good too not at boring was fun to eat nothing heavy great service spoiler alert no free refills but tasty lemonade with rhubarb
539,i went to cafe at the square 4 years ago someone was recently asking me about the wet food in new orleans and i had to let them know to visit this place they have the best fried green tomatoes years later i m still thinking about how amazing their food was xoxo
540,as a california girl i ve been dying to get to parnassus books for a long time and it didn t disappoint as a book blogger and avid reader walking into this store was like magic the staff is really friendly and sweet everything about this store is fantastic from the book selections to the children s area to the gifts and they gift wrapped my book because i had said i loved their wrapping my experience here was absolutely wonderful and a treasured memory
541,food is decent slow but ok service asked to watch a golf tournament on one of the tvs and it took them 45 mins to change the channel asked 3 times we would have stayed longer and had more drinks etc if anyone bothered to accommodate paying customers
542,had the pizza delivered to the hotel that i was staying and it took 45 mins the pizzas are large slices and very good my only problem was it was very oily
543,food was awesome and customer service was great we had to wait 2 hours for a table which was a bummer but if you have to wait around for a table it s not a bad place to do it on the pier we all agreed that the wait was totally worth it and we will be back
544,a fantastic experience the best greek salad ever it s my favorite dish and all of eat every time my family has had the lamb chops lamb shank chicken skewers meatballs and octopus all very good but we don t like the rice or greek potatoes we prefer the potatoes to be crispier the best part of this restaurant is the dessert shop attached to it omg it s just worth a trip the cookies and pastries sweet and savory are out of this world
545,to the passerby this place is the structured like mediterranean love child of chipotle and subway but once the food is brought to your table zos steps it up reasonably priced and fresh meals it s not the same as a legit dining restaurant but is worth the stop for an easy bite shout out to eric the manager not only brought a friendly presence to what could have simply been an order and move on but he provided suggestions on the dishes and offered us humor behind the counter
546,visited the diner when they first opened unfortunately i thought they were shut down because the two venues owned by the same people were closed for renovation this year food and atmosphere were great
547,i m not going to say that i enjoy my visits here because i don t enjoy the process but it s not all bad the staff here is friendly and gets the job done quickly and efficiently i ve donated at the blood center and at a few different off site locations my latest donation was at lakeside mall i happened to be there and the giveaways were pretty cool a tricentennial tshirt i ll take it a box of russell stover s chocolates yep that s me the brick and mortar location is sort of dingy looking but it s clean there are drinks and snacks for you after you donate take advantage and have some to ward off any lightheadedness the phlebotomists here know what they re doing so follow their instructions if you re a first time donor they won t steer you wrong i feel like i m giving back when i make my donation and always hope that if i or my family is in the situation to need blood that it will be available bravo to these folks for doing what they do and helping out the community
548,been there are few times and each time they were excellent i ve had all of the different tacos and sides they offer and it s all good great for take out and eating in had one slightly off experience with the delivery but not bad enough the drop a star the burritos are huge if you get one it is plenty of food i made the mistake of try into eat a burrito and a taco and it was way too much
549,i have been here a many times now great service the food is delicious their shrimp soft tacos are very good family friendly too,delicious southern comfort food i enjoyed the mac n cheese and the deviled eggs which were awesome i also tried a rib which was sooooo good too the beer selection features some small batch selections and the craft cocktails looked well thought out and executed to perfection the decor is open and very welcoming a great addition to the grove
550,i ve been here a few times now i ll be honest i m caught somewhere between beer nerd from that one commercial with danny trejo and i still won t drink bud light i m no expert but i know enough about beer the more beers i try the less great they become i loved sofa king but all the others are just kind of okay to me also i want to note that when they kick run out of beers they weren t replaced with anything so there were just fewer options on the menu i really wish they had backups ready to take their places because of the fewer options they had this last time i wasn t thrilled with any of them of course the ones they ran out of were the ones i wanted to try i understand they are small but they can t be that small to not be able to produce beers to replace the kicked ones because they have canned a few beers and were able to make enough to have them distributed to the suburbs the only food i ve had here is the beer batter fried pickles which were good i d come back if i were in the area but i m not gonna make a special trip again
551,had the sicilian salad with a goat cheese truffle covered in pistachios and it was so yummy the owner is also a chef there and is so friendly he walks around to the tables and makes sure his guests are enjoying his food and if they need anything the ambiance is so nice and location is impeccable it is a small establishment so make sure you get in when you can because it will fill up fast
552,the food here is bomb its so delicious one of my fave places to eat in indy chicken satay pad kra prow and the fried rice are some of my faves sometimes spice lecel is less than what youd expect i usually up a spice level here over most other places to get the heat
553,i eat lunch here 1 to 2 times a week and have very good consistency in the quality of the food and service they really do offer fresh food items and breads oh your sweet tooth can also be satisfied with their pastries i only do the pastries on the weekends as one of my coworkers has told me that calories don t count on the weekends
554,very nice quiet lunch for four of us today seafood gumbo was outstanding and the monday special red beans and rice with a pork chop was equally good oh the bloody mary is special there service was spot on
555,the best mexican food the food is fresh and the salsa can t be beat the service is excellent as well you will not be disappointed
556,super bowl sunday super food and and even superer service had great etouffee and the train wreck much better than any cheesesteak be sure to go to the sit down counter for great service ask for margaret she rocks take away is for losers
557,we had an unexpected layover and the airline provided us a room near the philly diner we walked over and we were immediately greeted at the door and invited in the waitress was very friendly and helpful and the cheesesteak sandwich was delicious the service was excellent it is worth the walk
558,really chill atmosphere had the special sandwich for lunch which was delicious fianc had a couple of good beers bartender was super friendly,the cinnamon roll is to die for seriously must get also loved the breakfast buns stuffed with sausage and bacon
559,great pulled pork sandwich i ve never actually eaten at the store but i ve had their food at several fairs and events and the pulled pork has always been delicious it has great texture and is nice and juicy however their mac n cheese was kind of bland and their pulled chicken was dry but again that was at a stand they had at a fair i would def try their ribs and other options in the future
560,the best tom yum on the planet absolutely my favorite place to eat and so far my friends have all agreed they even send me pictures of my favorite dish the tom yum soup with coconut milk and medium spicy they have the most delicious rice cakes with a special sauce yum yum preeda and the rest of her wonder staff even know us by name they have a full vegan menu and a full non vegan menu giving you so much to chose from every time i visit i notice everyone in the restaurant has a smile on their face my good friend the other day tried their chicken basil and could not believe how delicious it was our compliments to the chef every city i visit i compare the thai restaurants to thai legacy and so far nothing has come close so when you visit preeda let her know greg sent you and that you ll have the tom yum just like he has it lol but seriously nothing compares to thai legacy
561,the thai basil is my favorite and if you don t order the thai donuts for desert you re missing out on life,chain restaurant but their menu options are good service is great and everything fresh
562,cool place i got the french toast which is thick cut and double battered at jacksons that means that they really just take two pieces of bread stacked together and fried it was delicious but you should know to expect the farthest thing from french toast when you order it at jacksons still delicious
563,felt like a little piece of the keys great new spot fish was on point as well as the shrimp tacos even took the pup will def be back get there early cause it does get packed
564,i went there for dinner it was amazing best restaurant i have gone to in my life food was amazing service excellent i would defiantly recommend coming here for lunch and dinner
565,mac and cheese is good but the toppings r kind of unspectacular corn bread crumbs a little too tasteless also overpriced for mac and cheese,quite good bibimbop dolsot maybe could be a little spicier liked the portion sizes i ve been twice it gets really busy at peak times so visit during non peak times
566,nice little wine bar in ferguson good selection of wines limited sharables menu but what is on there is really good they don t do a lot of different things like some bars but what they do do they do well will be back for sure
567,two words barbecue shrimp for real i would bathe in that sauce husband had the pork chop because the crazy man doesn t eat seafood his loss although he loved loved loved the pork chop so maybe not his loss also more seafood for me service was the best we ve had in new orleans so far and honorable mention to their bread pudding and chocolate cupcake with raspberry sauce if by chance the soup of the day is a red pepper soup with shrimp definitely get that or at least the soup trio it was on point so good you guys so good
568,i rarely go to indian restaurants that don t have a buffet so when i came here i was excited to see what they would have i let a coworker pick out the menu items because he has more experience in eating indian foods and has been here before everything was amazing especially apparent because i all caps this word when i saw each dish my eyes were overwhelmed by how colorful and vibrant they looked when i tasted each dish my tongue was overwhelmed by how delicious each dish was the garlic naan was especially delicious too we got the spicy and it was just the right amount even though this place is 30 minutes away from where i live in nashville i will definitely be back for more,there are about four pho places you d generally go to if you live in nashville and kien giang is one of them the last time i went they had poor customer service which severely impacted our experience so i didn t come back for 3 years came here because vn was closed now they are a lot better with their service and the food tastes a lot better unlike most other pho places you dont need to chug gallons of water after eating here i got the pho dac biet and it had generous portions of beef brisket tendons but only a few meatballs and one strand of tripe the bean sprouts basil and jalapeos were very fresh and tasted amazing in the pho only complaint about here would be the balance of ingredients in the pho was off so felt a little bamboozled overall great for the price taste and convenience bathroom was a little dirty and the pho could have more of whats advertised kien giang is a must try
569,only tried donuts from here recently when my coworker brought some back on the website they had some interesting flavors the donuts at softer since they are fresh my coworker said they moved slow in there and he had to wait a bit the donuts i had in the office were nothing special they were different but nothing about them really jumped out i d actually be ok eating my store bought donut
570,this place is outstanding best restaurant in tampa we ordered the caribbean plate with jamaican jerk curry and stew chicken the chicken was the most tender and soft the flavor was wonderful and unique delicious service by andre is top notch and he s attentive and genuinely cares about his customers i highly recommend to all
571,a wonderful experience service was attentive and friendly upon being seated we felt as if we were part of the family the food was flavorful and delicious we especially enjoyed the cheese naan bread atmosphere was warm and inviting all in all i am already excited to return to india caf and try more of the exciting sounding dishes on their menu
572,was recommended by a friend to try out this place when visitng santa barbara the wait was worth it everything they had was live price is pretty decent for the uni got the clam chowder uni with svallop and bisq bowl the uni was super fresh and not fishy i would definitely come back and try other food they have when im back in santa barbara
573,ordered via bite squad delivery food is good for the most part chicken i received was pretty fatty very unappetizing ordered a side salad with no onions or peppers not that it should matter but i have an allergy apparently no onions peppers means extra of both so in the trash it went delivery guy also got lost on the way to my house which is literally two miles straight up hillsborough ave not impressed
574,this was probably the best meal i ve had in a long time curried goat shrimp gnocchi where re that smokiness coming from
575,excellent hotel service is impeccable and accommodations are first rate we have stayed at this hotel three times visiting boise and have not been disappointed this year we stayed during the 4th of july and had a perfect view of the fireworks from ann morrison park
576,the only place in boise that does crepes that i know of after traveling and having them at other places it s nice to know that we have this here in boise we will definitely be back,my wife and i found this place while traveling in st pete the first night we tried going we were too late and ended up getting there 20 min before closing and weren t able to eat we were glad that we went back for a second try and found it was worth the wait we split the tomahawk steak and it was more than plenty and the split plate charge for the side and salad is more than reasonable
577,pikpon is a small clean and spicy little shop you could easily miss because the sign is too small thankfully yelp finds even the most hidden gems i ordered the spicy basil fried rice peppers onion string beans chili egg with chicken which is enough for 2 people the dish is medium spicy but plenty hot for the average palate chicken was plentiful in the take out dish i will definitely return for the lobster or pad thai or one of the many thai drinks on the menu
578,have come to the bricks a few times as i wait for classes there is wifi and it s a nice environment to sit eat grab a beer and do some homework if i m in ybor for an extended period of time and have to wait i usually try to make it here as much as i can
579,our tour guide bree knew so much about the history of new orleans and the tombs on the cemetery tour that we feel we learned much more than expected she was fun and charming and we enjoyed all the different things she spoke about as well as seeing the gravesites and congo square amazing history i know i never got in school we highly recommend this tour and this wonderful young lady
580,i booked an appointment with rebecca online not knowing what to expect when i arrived to this new salon everyone at halo hair was wonderful the ladies who run the place are very warm my haircut and color went great their prices are fair definitely coming back rebecca was very nice to talk to and work with
581,this place is in incredible really fun atmosphere we ve had delicious brunch before but that wasn t an option on monday so glad we had lunch the legend the boudreaux pizza and debris fries simply put awesome,food was wonderful i had the traditional egg benedict it was incredibly tasty good atmosphere and very friendly service highly recommend
582,my boyfriend and i came down to the beach from our orlando trip for the day and couldn t help but stop by they have a great outside look being right by the beach and they even had live music it was a sunday afternoon and not very busy our waitress sierra was very attentive and sweet i forgot the drink she recommended but they were super good my boyfriend and i had two each the food was the best we had while in florida it was presented well and tasted delicious i thought the avocado egg rolls were a must try and was not disappointed my shrimp and grits and my boyfriend s burger were great too great experience at salty s
583,i loved bailey s i wasn t feeling well before i went but once i got some food in me i wanted to try everything i wasn t feeling a burger so i got a cup of chili and fries with regular ketchup i was so confused about the chili when i first got it because it looked like it was potato soup turns out they put beer cheese on top of it it was awesome there were a lot of beans in the chili i m not normally a fan of beans but they tasted fine in the chili the fries were really good too i tried the beer cheese sauce homemade ketchup and the truffle garlic aioli the homemade ketchup was so interesting i think there was cinnamon in it i loved all three of them i tried the drinks and they were great especially they strawberry basil and cherry limeade the best part about our meal had nothing to do with the restaurant we were here for my sister s bachelorette party there was a convention in town so a big group of them were at the restaurant they heard that my sister was getting married so they offered to pay our entire table s bill it was 8 people so it must have been close to 150 they also bought us all shots and had the entire restaurant sing happy wedding day to my sister it was a really fun experience our server was super cool too she didn t write down anyone s order and got it all right
584,amazing anniversary dinner staff all wished us happy anniversary table was ready with a congratulation card when we sat all the food was excellent well prepared and without the need for any additional seasoning fast service and prompt attention at all times complementary dessert at the end was a nice surprise and really capped off a great night
585,best pancakes ever the pecan banana pancakes are a must have i m never eating pancakes again because no other pancakes could live up to the pecan banana pancakes
586,so happy to have this in my neighborhood we ordered lamb vindaloo chicken tikka masala and papadum for take away and were really pleased with the whole experience from the nice guy at the counter to the food quickly being ready the recipe they use for the masala sauce was a little different from and better than the typical one i ve had at countless places in different cities over the years the chicken was super tender that dish was the star of the meal the lamb wasn t quite as tender as i expected though not tough by any means and the vindaloo was tasty and satisfying the papadam wasn t quite crisp enough given that it was still warm and clearly freshly made but still addictive overall i d say 4 5 stars will definitely be back many times and look forward to exploring the menu
587,we were in town for vacation and we were interested in biscuit love gulch and the line was out the door we decided to try milk and honey instead we had a 30 minute wait but it went by fast since they have things you can look at and purchase to pass time once we got seated i ordered the dirty benny and it was outstanding the service was great and the orange juice is second to none the food was brought out in a timely manner i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone thank you for the great experience
588,my husband and i enjoy eating at vecchia osteria on weekends we bring our own wine and the homemade pasta is excellent the assortment of platters available suits our lifestyle eating out nice restaurant to relax and enjoy your night out or lunch
589,not sure how to feel about this place after waking up this morning with extreme abdominal pain and being stuck in the bathroom my boyfriend and i dropped by this place because we haven t eaten all day and this was the only place that looked less sketchy in the area our waitress was amazing and the food seemed to taste good i had the catfish basket and my boyfriend had the soft shell crab basket we both exchanged a couple bites of each but mainly ate whatever we had seeing that this is the only place i ate yesterday evening it must be the cause of my stomach cramping and bathroom visits which is why i gave it 3 stars,i only come here for their ice cream it s always been delicious but nothing that amazing for the prices but would be a nice place for a date or to escape the hot stl summer
590,love this place the food is authentic and the portions are generous and reasonably priced service and ambiance are very typical for a vietnamese restaurant comfortable and friendly i love that they have options for small or large sizes for their soups i also love that they have the option of brown rice noodles instead of white rice noodles that s hard to find overall this hidden gem is one of my top choices for vietnamese in new orleans
591,my wife and are are regulars at penca i love the language tacos and she likes the calabacitas we both live their classically made craft cocktails
592,i m on an atkins diet and i find the sausage and egg biscuit and the ultimate omelette biscuit at hardee s to be a perfect pow carb option excluding the biscuits of course the ultimate omelette has eggs cheese sausage and bacon and it is tasty with a good consistency the sausage and egg was good not great i went through the drive up at 7 am on a wednesday morning and had a 7 minute wait from my order they were busy the lady was nice who served me oder was correct although no thank you for the order
593,legit authentic mexican food it s run by a family and they never disappoint give it a try and you ll leave satisfied and full
594,without being accused of you just like jenn and billy billy and jenn so of course you are giving them 5 stars they are getting solid 4 stars the kind of 4 stars that in a couple of months as they iron out the kinks should move straight to 5 also we outsourced the selection of the plates to wonderful servers kitchen staff 0 maybe my standards for size are dropping thanks to the incredible rents nyc restaurants pay but this place is huge absolutely positively huge and it seems it is able to deliver consistent food 1 spiced yogurt this thing is absolutely positively delicious take it from someone who spent a lot of time in the middle east it is the bomb creamy garlicy and delicious and fried pita oh my god the fried pita or maybe it was not even a pita get it 15 out of possible 10 points 2 stuffed grape leaves definitely not what i expected i dont quite know how i feel about it being called stuffed grape leaves since one expects a rather specific middle eastern interpretation of what it should be it was not it was something else even though true to the form it was stuffed grape laves 9 out of 10 points probably because i cannot get over how it was something else than what i expected based on a name still excellent 3 dates yummy they could even be a desert less sweet dessert if someone did not want to have a traditional middle eastern desert 9 out of 10 4 peri peri shrimp i have no words just get it 10 out of 10 5 broccoli tabouleh i may have to reconsider my general antipathy towards broccoli it was that good 9 out of 10 6 merguez kebab absolutely positively delicious get it get it and get it 10 out of 10 i think we got two more things but i was so full by the time i dont even quite remember what they were food coma they were however very well done
595,they say there is a first time for everything but i definitely would not make it a second time we didn t have a horrible experience but it wasn t a pleasant one either we were sat instantly but i didnt see booths which can be inconvenient for a family like mine with a toddler who doesn t sit still in a chair yet our waitress wasn t she didn t seem like she liked her job or us either one the wait time for our food was ridiculous we had one hamburger corn dog and a grilled cheese sandwich i want to say we waited a good 30 minutes after putting our order in the hamburger was okay my husband said there wasn t really anything special or made this one stand out same with the corn dog but i was upset that my grilled cheese sandwich didn t have melted cheese the bread was toasted but the cheese was not melted at all our drinks never got refilled we didn t see our waitress after we got our food until she brought back our check so i couldn t even ask her to heat up my sandwich any more or to get refill on drinks we walked out with a 35 bill with no refills or melted cheese i wont be coming back to this place
596,i had awesome service at this spot they had a great wine deal on wednesday and delicious pizza caitlin was my server bartender and she was adorable will definitely be back popped into the bronx bar next door too and the music was bangin was thinking about going to ms maes but i felt way more at home at this place a little uptown gem
597,the donuts are delicious i loved that they were made to order style they come out so fresh you have to eat the donuts when they re warm it s so good i went with two friends near closing time and it was pretty busy so i would suggest going earlier to avoid the end of the day crowd there are thousands of ways you could customize the donuts i love that there are so many options great place to come
598,really enjoyed my inaugural visit this past saturday night it is hidden in an office park but is well worth searching out we were greeted with smiles by the friendly bartenders and the crowd was boisterous and fun although we didn t have a chance to enjoy all of their offerings we each had two beers and i took a few crowlers home as well the vibe was very cool there was a food truck outside in the courtyard and the service was excellent the sours and ciders were on a small board listed next to their main offerings so we initially missed them but everything was excellent helpful staff good brews good tunes excited to get back there excellent addition to the burgeoning wilmington brew scene
599,great tacos cozy atmosphere they have happy hour and taco thursdays staff are friendly affordable i think i ll be a frequent visitor
600,update best sunset in nola 2 for 2 fantastic spot drank mimosas on the stoop for 3 hours during mardi gras the service was impeccable extraordinarily accommodating thanks babe squa best stoop squad,fantastic spot drank mimosas on the stoop for 3 hours during mardi gras the service was impeccable extraordinarily accommodating thanks babe squad best stoop squad
601,the brick build atop pennsylvania field stones matches the interior detailed handmade hardwood floors a unique rarity you can t find anymore ms kathy was very sweet and more than accommodating with the specific features we were in search for i d highly recommend giving their leasing office a call
602,the budweiser campus is really quite spectacular my 10 year old daughter enjoyed the bud light tour immensely with all of the extra details pointed out by our wonderful tour guide she even got to stand with a clydesdale for a picture there is walking inside and out of buildings but very doable there was lots to see and learn buy tickets in advance when we arrived lots of times were sold out
603,great little place for hh oysters are huge service was great and the drinks delicious
604,a tucson original these guys have been in business for a very long time and they have really good fried chicken fried chicken strips fried steak strips and fried shrimp all of the food is really good just kinda pricey or would give 5 stars
605,we stumbled in here randomly to grab lunch and were blown away with the food everything we got was excellent from the first bite to the last it was great
606,the food was amazing we tried a little bit of everything had the crawfish beignet seafood stuffed mushrooms crab cakes crab cake po boy and seafood flatbread everything we had was delicious
607,love it food is always on point service is great we usually always eat at the hibachi side but tonight ate at the dine in side i think we will do that more often unless we are with a group of people lunch is always cheaper of course but also have early bird special i believe the hours are from 430 530 so a little cheaper for hibachi meal and have sushi specials then as well crunchy shrimp roll is always good
608,food was amazing the wait staff was so nice and basically made seats for us so we could eat it was very crowded the price was affordable and the atmosphere was really nice
609,fabulous experience today jacob worked his magic on my nails super service only a short wait i will be back
610,i had a quesadilla that was delicious the drinks was good also i just didn t like the seating was a little uncomfortable
611,the lobster roll has almost too much lobster delicious as was the lobster bisque and clam chowder if you re looking for great seafood this is the place not the cleanest place i d have to say the open kitchen looks clean and staff are all friendly many regulars there when we were
612,i had such a great experience at mass ave tattoo patrick was my artist and he was very kind and patient through the entire process this was my first tattoo and i was getting in honor of my dad who recently passed away i brought in a letter my dad had wrote to me and wanted his handwriting tattooed on my forearm it took a few sketches but patrick came up with resemblance of my dad s handwriting i absolutely love my tattoo patrick is the man the shop is super clean as well if i get another tattoo i ll definitely be back
613,this zoes kitchen is one of the best that i have been to in my travels the staff here is so nice and the food is wonderful my daughter is gluten free and the manager went out of his way to explain her options going back today for take out for the eagles game
614,it s a good diner i ve only had breakfast a few times good service great bacon great pancakes and you can get cheese and onions on the home fries they also have a selection of different grilled cheeses will try that next time they probably should take credit cards at this point but i always have enough cash to eat at a diner i m not expensing any meals so it doesn t affect me
615,my favorite go to spot the must have are the two for 1 bloody marys i have been dining here for the last 10 years and everything on the menu is superb i love the music they play i enjoy sitting outside on the patio it s almost a little tropical paradise in the heart of citrus park the oysters are always fresh the drinks are refreshing and the food is always delicious check out their daily specials you can t go wrong with anything you choose they also have live music at night on the weekends i say it s a must try
616,this is my first time visiting this steakhouse the atmosphere was really nice upon entering the building the food was tasty yet slightly overpriced in comparison to some of my favorite steskhouses in the indy area one thing that stuck out is that the chef added a heap of the yum yum white sauce into the fried rice that was bothersome because i m not a big fan of it now i know to request that it not be added for next time this place loses one star due to the cost and yum yum sauce in my rice special shout out to yelp for the free edamame deal through the app
617,wife and i decided to give this a try we are from southern california and we are mostly use to those kind of all you can eat korean bbq decided to give this spot a try and it was great and service was awesome only downside is that it isn t all you can eat so it can get a bit pricey but overall food was awesome really hit the spot for being homesick
618,burger up is my go to local burger restaurant here in town all locations are independently owned which is slightly odd to me the cool springs location is the one i usually go to the mac and cheese bites and truffle fries are a dream topped with the honey mustard aioli the black and bleu burger or the fried chicken sandwich are my top menu picks but they are not available at all locations really you can t go wrong with what you pick i have yet to have a bad meal here at the cool springs location there is an enclosed patio that is great at the 12south location there are community style tables and even the booths tables are extremely closed together and packed close so get ready for your neighbors to hear your entire conversation
619,family friends and everyone you are happy to meet all under one roof i have some feels for this place and they all come from the caring hearts of this establishments owners amazingly the staff all remember me by name each time i stop by i usually stick to the salmon dinners and wings but when i do indulge its the angel hair alfredo with sauteed chicken i have dreams about food when i diet heavy and this is one of my normal courses in la la land my favorite place for all that it is and will be thanks to robert and henry and their lovely family and staff for always making me feel important not to be confused with impotent
620,my family and i had a reservation here on a saturday night which i highly recommend and we all enjoyed our meals it states business casual as the recommended attire but there were people who dressed casual the staff are all nice and accommodating after we placed our orders we were given complimentary french bread and butter i tried not to get full from it but the bread was too good some of our orders included honey glazed pork chop bacon wrapped shrimp and grits gumbo burger filet mignonette and crab ravioli everything but the burger was a hit my father in law thought his burger was a little dry but he ate it all anyway which states that he liked it in a way when my mom s gumbo was too dry the waiter gave her another gumbo the place is a symbol of great dining i would recommend this restaurant for those visiting nola since it takes reservations it is advisable to do so
621,went here with my daughters and it was delicious we shared a few things the brussel sprouts kale salad and the ropa vieja were phenomenal drinks were also great and super friendly service what more could you ask for whenever i am back in town i definitely will come again
622,good food but do not go there on july 4th called in my order 3 days before for pick up at 2 00 not only wasn t it ready they had no record of it finally got the food 45 minutes later how a rib joint can be so disorganized beyond me they act like this holiday doesn t come every damn year
623,awesome take out great local place in bensalem food is hot and delicious it hits the spot
624,the food was amazing i paid 9 99 at lunch and got a delicious spicy soup crunchy buttery naan rice an awesome garlic chicken appetizer and tikka masala everything was delicious the restaurant itself is extremely clean both stylistically in the decor and just plain cleanliness the servers were friendly and kept our glasses full my only complaint is that there was no music playing which is a little awkward upon walking in i will definitely be back and bringing some friends
625,first time my girlfriend and i came here and it was delicious the french toast was just right the thing that did for me though was the hash browns absolutely amazing waiter was kind and was nice enough to check up on my girlfriend and i to see how we re doing great experience
626,loved this place and bywater interesting music neat food and wine choices seating is a huge pain in the ass not enough room and it is that fighting over a seat thing i hate no idea how they fix that i guess you have to show up at 5pm and wait
627,aaaaahhhhhmazing if you want the true flavor of new orleans in a neighborhood diner full of ambiance this is the place the sweet potato waffle is the best no wait the pecan pancake or maybe the banana pancake and crab cakes and chicken okay it s all great
628,first stop on the trip and it was absolutely delicious this would be my recommended spot for shrimp and grits every time i can t say enough about their delicious food friendly staff and speedy service
629,we were flying from lax to tucson on 5 18 18 10pm flight the flight was a bit delayed because the southwest airline staff were gracious to wait for passengers from another fight that arrived late to transfer to our plane this speaks to the heart of care of wanting to ensure passengers do not miss their connecting flight in doing so some passengers were concerned that they may miss their ability to get car rentals when the plane arrives later at tuscon the southwest staff called the rental car companies to remain open until the plane arrives for the passengers we were one of those groups of individuals when we arrived late we were able to pick up our rental car kudos to this group of southwest airline staff this is what caring customer service looks and feels like thank you
630,i can t believe we ve lived here 5 years and just discovered this place cool location next to a waterfront park plenty of room and a great tap selection i had looked at the menu before and that s what drew us in even better than expected we went in the afternoon and it was chill with a nice reggae selection on the sound system i got the turkey artichoke sandwich and it was delicious my girlfriend got the chicken cordon bleu sandwich and loved it we also had the pickle spear appetizer the curly fries are more like spiral fries and have seasoning like potato logs i can t wait to come back and try more of the menu they also do a sunday brunch with a bloody mary bar
631,good food served cold there s nothing more disappointing than to get good food served cold this place can get really busy but i usually go early before the rush in the evening my order was the stuffed lobster with salad garlic potatoes and corn on the cob i ordered an extra boil of melted butter to put on the crab meat stuffing just in case the stuffing was dry when i tasted the stuffing it was barely warm and the lobster meat was a bit dry and not as hot as it should have been seem like left over lobster reheated there was really no reason why the dish was not hot enough as there were hardly any other people there at the time that would have caused them to rush the order out some restaurants keep the serving plates hot so that the food stays hot longer i could have sent it back and told them to heat it up but didn t feel like doing that because to me there really wasn t any reason for it to be served cold
632,i ve never reviewed a restaurant on yelp before but my family s dinner at luke was so phenomenal that i felt compelled to write this meal was one of the top three meals of my life and i ve eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world our waiter richie rich was the best waiter we ve ever had the perfect combination of funny knowledgeable and compassionate he made us feel like part of his family the food was to die for the bread was warm and fresh the drinks were perfectly mixed the raw oysters were fresh and succulent i had the shrimp touffe which was excellent my wife had the chicken which was perfectly cooked and full of flavor my children split the chicken tenders which were obviously hand breaded and perfectly cooked the desserts were to die for this was the best meal i ve ever had in new orleans and i ve never had a bad meal in that town don t sleep on luke
633,my husband and i stopped here for lunch he has the tennessee and i had the west texas the fries were crispy on the outside and soft in the center like they should be i had the chili which tasted like it had been cooked down with beer and topped with crispy onion strings overall this place was really good the negatives would be that there was a wait at lunch this was easily rectified by sitting at the bar and avoiding the wait i am giving 4 stars because this isn t the absolute best burger i ve ever had busy it s still really good
634,i m a 20 year avis customer wanted to give a special thanks to allen b at 30th street i needed a vehicle that could fit a wheel chair in the vehicles available could not accommodate my needs allen went above and beyond to help me find vehicle i was happy with the vehicle he given me which was a jeep cherokee the wheel chair fit perfectly i will continue to use avis while my grandmother is in town
635,front end service was 5 stars and the space is elegant with an up scale feel wait staff was attentive and is well trained back end was 2 stars because entrees took very long and were unimpressive flavor was good but short on some ingredients the veal special was just a breaded fried veal cutlet no cheese no sauce pappardelle with pork had almost no pork tasted fine though chocolate hazelnut tort dessert took very long to expedite and preparation was inconsistent we ordered 3 there were 5 of us at the table and one came with chocolate shavings while 2 did not one was also stuck to the plate and the crust was like stone they did comp us on the dessert which was very nice considering the wait it s a nice place and they obviously put a lot of thought and money into the space cuisine and concept i hope they can work out the defects and execute on their vision
636,cool new neighborhood spot we walked up from our house got right in waited about 5 minutes at the bar while studying the long cocktail menu ordered 2 drinks quickly paid then popped out back to enjoy our drinks they had a nice vibe great cocktail menu cocktails the food we saw around us all looked delicious too so we ll be back to try it try more cocktails upon leaving there was a crowd outside the door waiting to get in good for you pearl diver welcome to the neighborhood from another new neighbor
637,we go here all the time to get awesome coffee just chill lattes chai tea are amazing environment is super welcoming
638,i go here after my daughters ballet class weekly its a pretty small location and i wish they had family night like they do at pyramids and plainfield locations food as usual is always great and service is pretty prompt,i rarely travel to this side of town westsider but my sister suggested it for our family bday sinner set inside a strip mall i couldn t tell if it was even open from the outside but once inside it was very clean and welcoming i ordered the cajun chicken pasta and they didn t skimp ok the cheese or spices it was delicious the toast was well seasoned as well our party of 7 loved all our meals and the prices cant be beat thanks
639,pretty straight forward chicken fingers fries cole slaw and some texas toast it s simple and good the sauce definitely makes it remember to get some sweet tea to wash it down
640,i admire breakfast for opening their space to all ages shows regularly featuring artists photos paintings even sculptures and hosting casual food pop ups i know many reviewers have said the left side of the shop is gimmicky and too hip branded merch surf skate mags and comfy chairs but the last time i was here kids were loving the connect four out on the table what s to hate about that that said their espresso can be hit or miss and sometimes my gibraltar milk is a little too hot and a little too fluffy but they use good beans and their drip brew is great yes their staff can be intimidatingly terse but regulated cheeriness that s the norm at shops that rhyme with candlejar doesn t have a place here i like that where else in santa barbara can you sit on a sofa and drink a cuppa find an outlet next to your table simple problems breakfast is a simple answer
641,our waitress mandy was absolutely excellent surprisingly excellent service i wasn t expecting this for a logan s thanks mandy we came in on saturday 6 23 lunch
642,the staff was super nice and let us try some samples it looked nice and clean in there they have all the speciality favors out in the front and the standard flavors are in the back i really loved my waffle cone with chocolate chip ice cream the cookie monster ice cream was good too
643,this place rocks came here based on recommendation and so glad we did the basil ryeman beer is a great compliment to the impossible veggie burger fries i don t even know what was on it but boy was it good burger fries was 18 so a little pricey but enough for 2 people to split don t miss tennessee brew works
644,great space not a big place so prepare to sit st the bar but the wait is worth it food is amazing
645,great fresh oysters ordered a half dozen and sat down enjoy them and people watch only thing that could have made them a bit better would to be a little more chilled i love my oysters cold
646,this is my first time to ever feel the need to leave a review at any restaurant i eat at granite city maybe once a month good beer and good service i ate here last weekend and sat at the bar great bartenders and service was on point this night up until let s just say a very unexpected experience for the entire bar i have never experienced anything like this and was not expecting it from granite city as i consider it one of the more classy establishments but i guess being next to a hotel you never know what people could frequent there out of nowhere the entire bar hears people screaming specifically one lady now i have no idea what was going on as i was adjacent at the bar but it escalated quickly the blonde bartender says she is going to get the manager and quickly after the manager appears behind the bar the lady is cussing at the manager and bartender yelling distracting everyone the manager was a young woman i don t recall her name but is there every time i have ever been in the building she tells her bartender that it s ok she would handle things and could tell her first concern was that bartender was ok i was pleasantly surprised by that then proceeds to get yelled at by lady and man which i assumed to be the lady s husband or boyfriend the manager is calm the whole time asking them to calm down but they refused mind you this has been going on for several minutes and she finally asks them to leave the manager remained professional and polite meanwhile being cussed at repeatedly i can not hear every word as i was not directly beside the people but she did ask them to leave and the man wanted to talk to another manager there was a man standing around watching and come to find out this was the general manager he was watching this happen and did not speak up until man requested another manager and that s when the lady pointed him in the man general managers direction being a man and finding out the general manager who is also a man was letting his female staff be yelled at and cussed is what drove me to leaving this review now i do not know what the general manager said to this man because they went outside to talk but the man came back in and had a margarita at the bar after he was asked to leave by the other manager how does that work is my question the young woman manager apologized to the bar for the disruption and asked if there was anything she could do before she walked away i have never experienced anything like this like i prior stated i would have thought the young woman was general manager by how the situation was handled i wrote this review not to scrutinize anyone but hope someone of higher power sees this and finds out what is going on in that place with upper management again restaurant is great and never have had any complaints just this weekend was out of the usual for this place
647,best food came from miami and realy good dominican food wao i recommend this place 100
648,great grocery for for everyday items usually no wait for check out fast counter should be more ready for items out of stock or need more prep time i have waited more than most would for items that need to be made due to being sold out clean friendly staff left publix for this 1 location on grocery store now has a tesla charging station
649,hands down the best alaskan crab legs i ve ever had and great beer the staff was awesome and the view is absolutely beautiful from the pier highly recommend
650,please note the coffee is excellent however you have to ask for cream and sugar i find this pretentious and intimidating it s coffee i want it how i want it it shouldn t be such a big deal
651,fritopiefriday and a plush clear bubblegum dreamsicle sno bizzle we went through the drive thru while trying to waste time in metry
652,this place is absolutely amazing the owners are very friendly service is fast excellent you ll definitely feel at home in this place the food is always fresh and seasoned just to perfection the only place i will eat middle eastern food from
653,not bad nice atmosphere not a lot of games i had to wander a while to find a free video poker machine payback was about equivalent to the strip no free cocktails
654,i love these apartments i just moved in two weeks ago and this place is great everyone in the front office is really nice especially crystal crystal got me approved and took care of everything i needed to move in plus she s super helpful every time i have a question i m super excited to get to know the area and everyone in my building
655,i used to love this place for their chocolate milkshakes but recently they ve made it super milky and very thin which i don t appreciate at all the food is good and flavourful but quantities are on the lower side for the price you pay
656,gin is uhhhmazin is what im sayin i felt like snoop doggy dogg on his euphoric level ate at gin sippin on soju juiccccccce soooo good i laid back prices are cheap family style environment atmosphere is soothing im lovin it 1 establishment makeup french quarter vibes all over with the iconic balcony windows screaming at you les bon ton roule 2 pass the entrance of french quarter doors you will see a garden patio with open sky corridor view just uppercut me gin why don t u so i can stare at the skies just a lil bit longer beautiful view 3 left side is crystal event hall for private parties with karaoke yes i said it karaoke just shut up and take my money and give me the mic 4 right is gin korean bbq let me tell you bayyyyy bay i walked in vietnamese man and walked out a vietorean man just call me sun bae i got koreanified beef beef and morrrre beef and it was bomb literally every bite was a kabooooom of yummay goodness all meat marination was a korean sensation ohh soo good would be understatement personal favorite was the steak kim chi ohhhh yesss plz bibimbop rice with savory ingredients topped off with an oozing egg oh my my and another my at your own kitchen table whippin like a stir fry was exciting can t wait to try out the full menu and have my mouth kabooomed with yummay goodness again and again gin im coming back for a full attack if you a local or a tourist this place is a must try if u haven t bayyy bay get your priorities together
657,i m from southern cali and i always come here when i visit i would never order crawfish back home but i always love the spicy crawfish here it s pretty spicy but you can t stop because it s so good my family and i were able to share 2 lbs between the 4 of us and we were fine for a small lunch they don t have different spicy levels fyi when we ordered we also got our food very quickly probably because all we got were the crawfish and it was already made
658,really good food it was super busy my order got a bit messed up but the waiter took care of everything had to wait a little more for what i actually ordered
659,holy ish y all i was in love with everything i tasted at this place i brought my kid sister in since we were both in the mood for some asian flare but were having difficulty finding anywhere open between 2 3 pm on a monday the crab rangoon were only 3 but came 4 to an order and the flavors were just amaaaaazing the cream cheese mixture had a perfect level of peppery spice a subtle sweetness from both the crab and sauce drizzled on top balanced everything perfectly their miso soup is not that watered down crap you get at most places it s full bodied and you re given a generous portion my sister had the beef donburi bowl which i tasted and and really enjoyed she kept repeating i can t believe i ve never been here before she d definitely go back for the donburi bowl alone i got two sushi rolls one being a panko bagel roll with smoked salmon cream cheese cucumber crab stick miso garlic a variety of sauces which perfectly sated my craving for a heavier fried roll this roll was huge too almost twice the size i was expecting the other roll i got was the angry hamachi which included regular hamachi yellowtail spicy hamachi avocado jalapeno cilantro roe y all this roll was so fresh and balanced i was so stinkin happy the lemon and cilantro made it a step above the rest for sure the service was pretty good but even if it weren t i d still keep coming back for their amazing food
660,great burger spot no frills great staff and amazing prices love that this is right down the block,always great service amazing fish tacos and the nachos are so good the tuesday deals are always great definitely worth the trip
661,perfect place with great soups and everything what we have food was delicious and also the sweets
662,pretty solid place the burgers are good though not quite as craveable as shake shack and sometimes cooked a little more than i like medium means i should see pink you can get an egg on them though which obviously makes anything awesome even though the burgers aren t top tier this place makes up for it with comfy seating super friendly staff and all around good vibes and the milkshakes are awesome and beer
663,we are from missouri and stopped at this location for lunch is this place an epicurean marvel no but is very good and basic good food for the price with an added positive decor thrown in our food was good with a generous portion at a fair price i had fish and chips and my wife had a pasta both were good with drinks our bill was in the low 20s no place in this price range is perfect but when the service is good the food is good and the place is clean a customer can t ask for more
664,i had the steak here and it was really good the service was a bit slow though and they got my order wrong twice the ambience is a bit odd as you have to enter through a gift shop and the room is actually so dark that the menus have lights clipped on them it s expensive because it knows it has a captive audience but at least the food was good
665,i m torn we moved here recently and tried this place last night folks that ordered after us got their food first which the woman behind the counter noticed and tried to correct had a delicious burrito really was good but it was straight up cold the chicken inside was as cold as if it came out of the fridge just then rice and beans were warmish i was bummed b c out of several mexican places around even in downtown media i thought the flavor here had the most potential i will say they kindly offered to remake it but i was in a rush and couldn t wait i liked the options and add ins to each meal and the chips and salsa were really good will be back and hopeful it was just an off night
666,we have actually ate here a total of three times this trip they truly have something for everyone staff are super friendly and accommodating very active at getting people in and out on the weekends there can be quite a crowd environment is clean and staff work to keep it that way
667,this place was new to us and we wanted to go try it out walking in the place felt very homely i liked how it smelled fragrant but not as much as other restaurants i ordered a yellow curry my partner ordered the thai basil and we got tom yum soup the curry was not bad but the consistency of the curry was not good it was very liquid y and not enough curry okay likely added too much coconut milk the tom yum soup was great amazing taste but only for those who enjoy fragrant and heavy tasting soups this soup is very strong in both sweet and sour the thai basil was a bit weird when we got it it was really watery which most thai basil do not have a large amount of liquid it also tasted a bit off the chicken did not taste great overall however it was food it tasted like amateur cook made the food tldr if you have not had thai food before this place might be okay for you normal thai food tastes like this however if you have eaten enough thai food you will understand that this place is a bit subpar
668,this restaurant is so great i can come here all the time and it s not that expensive so that s why love islands
669,what s good here i ended up with a large extended stay room that included a kitchen it s an upscale place that does indeed have a unique character although i was here for a conference at the indianapolis convention center and not the hotel s meeting space i could see that the meeting room areas were very nice all staff members were polite and helpful so why only three stars the hotel layout is odd when i first arrived i came in through the parking garage and wandered the second floor and then first floor until i found check in my room was in a building across a skywalk the elevator seemed to be broken in hindsight it s just that slow to arrive so i used the stairs the hvac in my room does not work i did not bother to complain since i know the hotel is 100 full so i can t exactly hold this against them they likely would be on top of it if i asked if you are in town for a convention be aware that not only is it a long walk but also you will need to go through some pretty rough dark areas under bridges inhabited by the local homeless population some are rather aggressive about panhandling and i wouldn t advise walking to the convention or downtown restaurants bars alone that brings me to the hotel s dining options there is an upscale bar by the lobby and a very costly and poorly stocked breakfast buffet the bar itself is obnoxiously bright in the evening in my opinion there is a yolk restaurant as well nothing fast or easy if you want to grab something and get on your way in the morning you d better pack your own groceries summary the hotel isn t terrible but for the price there are much better options i won t stay here again unless i have no other options
670,we were greeted as soon as we walked in very friendly staff our dinner started off with sushi caribbean roll and boston roll both were amazing jasmin tea was very enjoyable we shared the egg plant special with garlic sauce and shrimp with cashews nut sauce both very good and nice portions dinners come with jasmine rice both dinners came with different mixed veggies the dinners were not spicy at all but they have a spice tray that you can add your own heat
671,fun games kid friendly but if u want happy friendly staff u r not going to get it ma am go around the other side of the wall even though it ended up at the same place just puddle doff and angry not fun and vibrant as the games and atmosphere try to vibe this should be disneyland by the game vibe but wait staff hate they work here
672,portion size of the food is big i ordered the nachos with beef and cheese special needed a little salt but other than that it was good service on the other hand we had a new waiter not very attentive friendly but not attentive how to call him twice would come again to try other stuff on the menu and a different waiter
673,i was surprised by the food at this hotel bar and grill the reason we tried it was because it was on a night when we did not feel like going anywhere as we were staying at the hotel for a convention all the food we ordered was great and the bartender made the best old fashioned i have ever had i would recommend this place and the hotel is nice as well
674,this restaurant has traditional pub food overall i think the beers are hit and miss i prefer the oatmeal stout and apa not a fan of a lot of the lighter beers but that is also down to personal preference service has always been good for me the food is not my favorite though i have found a couple things i like i tend to go for the pretzel chicken which is pretty large though the potatoes often are lacking besides that most of the other things i have had i wouldn t order again it s not bad just not special and not that cheap for mediocre food sometimes they have live music so it s more a place i go to as a bar than a restaurant i will continue to go back occasionally for that chicken sandwich
675,excellent dog trainer knowledgeable patient creative great experience place to go to train your dog or just to make your bond stronger highly recommended
676,women on checking in were very very nice they were appropriately apologetic about the concierge lounge being closed when my cell phone he card wouldn t work very helpful in helping me figure it out they forgot to give me my bag with two waters this is such a big deal the rooms were standard carpeted poorly lit but the water pressure for a change was better than most places i stay at one thing i really liked wasn t having complementary sundries shaving cream razors toothbrush toothpaste and event deodorant it s almost the whole cvs right here my room just call them up and they will bring it to you the rooms facing the interior terrarium style pool area are nice big boy flat screen and an awesome number of charging ports clean and no acrid stenches the snack concession is a little thin no ice cream
677,the only place i will ever go for my hair needs every single person has always done a great job and the place is adorable they are awesome and never disappoint
678,southwest salad is so good clean nice play area employees were all kind and fast
679,visited this location for my brother s birthday dinner he ordered his steak medium rare it came out medium to well done they sent it back and it happened again without asking the manager refunded the money for the steak i thought that was really nice they take care of their customers and want to see them happy i was sad to see that they no longer have the steak colossal shrimp the food was good and the prices are great
680,if you are a vegan go here even if you re not a vegan go here this is a prime example of what vegan food should be they nailed everything from the food to the decor no detail was missed excellent flavors and great service sat with a group of four and we all agreed it was a delicious meal worth the price of admission
681,our first time at zimmer s and the line was wrapped around the store nice people and the line moved pretty efficiently it is a seafood place on friday in lent so makes sense we bought 2 lbs of crawfish 1 lb of boiled shrimp they ran out of crab some sausage and tried the marinated crab all were very good fresh and tasty but on the mild side i liked the marinated crab but not much meat in it as you dig through the crab pieces marinade was good though mild but flavorful and not salty which i liked we will definitely be back
682,very good calzone chilly in the restaurant very good service i recommend the calzones
683,i ended up at this location when i found out joe had moved to it from the sheldon location i ve trusted joe to advise me on needed repairs for years now he let s me know what i can put off for a little while if the budget is tight and he recently showed me that a 1 300 repair that was suggested at another location wasn t needed as a female going into a car repair shop feeling you can trust them is priceless
684,we loved our spooky tour with brian very articulate well delivered stories which caught both our attention and adventure seeking personalities a few good laughs too would highly recommend this tour for people who want to learn about the history ghost stories and interesting people that shaped new orleans
685,this was my favorite breakfast so far in nashville from nyc with husband and 2 children from the moment we walked in everyone was so nice and friendly we had eggs and biscuits delicious my son orders waffles and the other french toast by when he saw how good the waffles were and wanted to switch they did with no problem highly recommended

689,krystal and her team literally put together the wedding of my dreams being a bride from houston tx i hired a santa barbara local planner in hopes that they could connect me with some great local vendors she did not disappoint i barely know where to begin in terms of how amazing she is i honestly was lost in the wedding planing process before her by the time i found her we were already a little less than a year from the wedding date so from day one we hit the ground running krystal was so communicative so cooperative so patient so helpful so reassuring i mean the list goes on and on if i wasn t 100 sure or happy with the vendors she initially recommended she would always have an option that was exactly what i was looking for she knew my vision before even having to fully explain it she is that good in terms of day of wedding was march 31 2018 so this is still relatively fresh everything ran extremely smoothly i mean if there were any issues at all i didn t even know about them krystal checked in on us girls getting ready maybe once or twice just to see if we needed anything or how things were coming along and that was really it otherwise we were left to completely enjoy ourselves i was getting a little worried as we got closer to the ceremony time because we were running a little behind while getting ready but krystal was so calming and reassuring that everything will still run smoothly so i was not stressed about making it exactly to my timeline after the ceremony krystal had drinks in hand ready for us while taking photos she made sure we got some of our passed appetizers that were going around during our cocktail hour and she made sure we actually got some food and ate the rest of the night was just perfect the dj dj hectik someone highly recommended by krystal kept everyone on the dance floor the remainder of the night literally that day was my dream come true couldn t have been better i m gonna miss krystal it was amazing getting to work with her and i would do it again in a heartbeat
690,best shrimp and grits everrrr it s small so expect to wait to be seated but they are very efficient great staff great chefs
691,unbelievable sushi best cuts of fish i have ever had it s not cheap but dang it s worth every penny
692,if you are making a mexican meal this is the best store for it the meat is reasonable and there are so many things on sale here don t go by the ads on this place for sales there are far more sales that they don t publish i mean one month i got four stick of real butter for 1 49 a pack this is my favorite place to shop the only reason that i didn t give it five stars is because i think pulling their deli was bs
693,first time here in the area and decided to stop in for lunch the shrimp tacos were very good and had a lot of flavor enjoyable atmosphere and would be great for a small group to sit in the bar area
694,i haven t actually been to the location itself but i ordered off doordash and got the cilantro cream enchiladas and they were delicious the chicken was so good and everything was hot and fresh when it was delivered by my driver i would absolutely order from here again
695,i absolutely love going here for all my nail needs prices are great hospitality is even better they do such a great job i ve been going there for years i ve brought my mother and daughter here as well
696,never judge a book by the cover this place is just as distinctive as new orleans with its culture architecture and music upon arriving you will think your gps led you down the wrong road however once you get up the courage to explore around the shifty looking structure with jumanji like sounds coming from within you ll be captivated by its uniqueness each station brings an interactive and different approach to making music don t worry no experience necessary and you won t be criticized by your lack of musical talent this is a great experience for all young and old i am looking forward to returning to check out a live show or event there soon
697,great dry cleaners quick and efficient also had tailoring done here and they did a perfect job happy with the experience
698,definitely a good place for sushi on a budget i love to get the bigger fried rolls normally i get raw sushi at other restaurants but it s either a hit or miss here with the raw selection i ll get a couple of their sushi combos sometimes but the rice doesn t taste as sticky and fresh again can t go wrong with the fried rolls they are huge
699,their service is amazing i ordered a pizza for delivery love their pizza the order was inadvertently written as a pickup i called and they apologize however they offered to make me a new one and deliver it all free of charge i am really impressed

701,this is a good bar and grill with outdoor or indoor seating the food was good we sat outdoors at sunset and watched dolphins playing in the water as we ate it was a blast and the kids loved it cool atmosphere with our without children
702,hoe excited was i to find a gluten free vegan pizza up charge option staff was super accommodating and courteous when ordering gluten free it is common to be asked allergy or preferance but when i get down the line to add my toppings they actually switched gloves to prevent cross contamination which i have never seen before so thought full the price is pretty good for a personal pizza in this area the crusts are my favorite and are thin and nicely cooked lots of choices for toppings
703,fantastic i just arrived in no for the first time and made a stop at the creole house for a quick beer when i ordered a typical domestic beer my bartender beast refused to let me have on but instead suggested i try a local craft beer the beer was awesome i let him order my food and he brought me oysters and gator bites and both were spectacular beast was so fun professional and knowledgeable about the menu town and gave me many great suggestions i liked the experience so much i returned for dinner

708,this was mine and my fianc s first time eating here because it not only just opened up but i got a coupon for a free pizza so why not right we weren t blown away with the experience or the pizza but liked that it was fast and efficient the staff that made that pizza was very friendly but the cashier wasn t sharing that same enthusiasm wouldn t drive out of my way to go here but if we are in the neighborhood and feel like some pizza we may go back
709,excellent food and drink for a party of four the indoor atmosphere was warm with a southwest style but we chose to eat outdoors on a lovely florida day in the 70s amanda was an amazing server very engaging and on point with the food and drinks i had the enchiladas carnitas which were sublime in both taste and presentation i seriously can t remember what my wife had but it was a chicken dish that was amazing our two friends had skillet tacos one chicken and one pescado which they both loved we tried three different types of margaritas and all were tasty the only quibble being that the glasses are so small and the prices so high you only get maybe 8 ounces of actual liquid for your 10 or so next time we ll take it easy on the margaritas and enjoy some of the best mexican food in tampa
710,the first my hair was braided and i did not feel pain i have a big head my hair was completed in about 4 hours which was great time now the downfall is that my braider did not braid my hair pass the length of my natural hair which began to poof out weeks later because i do not have a relaxer i used human hair because my scalp can no longer tolerate the synthetic hair that is normally used i was a little upset afterwards because i had to take the braids out in 3 weeks time which was almost like a waste of money
711,one of the best thai restaurants that i have ever been to the pad thai was unbelievable full of great tastes and for dessert order the white elephant you will not be disappointed the owner has served me twice and both times he is so friendly that i enjoyed giving him a good tip he truly cares about his customers experience unlike most restaurant owners who care about the bottom line
712,so so good little tiny place with mostly 2 tops the meal we re suckers for a cheese board and got a very generous one for 12 they gave my son a bit of dough to make a mini pizza a really cute diversion pizza is thin crust chewy crispy spectacular sauce and premium toppings we got a calzone and my son got a cheese pizza canned soda and some wines salads look delicious guess we ll have to come back
713,this is one of my favorite restaurants in reno we usually end up coming here once a week for dinner the staff is always friendly and helpful with anything you need the food is always so yummy and the drinks perfect our go to items are the caprese salad and the chicken piccata they make a moscow mule that is one of the best we love this restaurants and recommend it to anyone we can
714,delicious and different no discounted lunch menu on weekends but prices are reasonable and portions would easily serve two very hungry people flatbread type bread is addictive we had the grape leaves entree with olives feta tomatoes and cucumbers on romaine like you would get in a greek restaurant and gheimeh a beef lentil stew that was bitter and tart with dried lime of which the server suggested i taste a sample before i ordered it since not everyone likes it i did but it is very bold the owner owns the entire mostly empty plaza and another persian room in scottsdale it s one of the most sumptuously decorated restaurants in tucson happy to have something different in town
715,best laundromat ever clean good music kids area bathrooms clean and modern delicious snacks plenty of machines friendly and helpful staff and plenty of room to fold your clothes highly recommend
716,a 90 minute wait to get in then got seated at 1 07 got our food at 1 59 can you say i was a little irritated someone i think it was a manager came to our table to say sorry about the wait but that was it no compensation or incentive to come back people who sat down after us next to our table received their order in 20 min not to rate the food might be difficult but i will try to be fair the sourdough french toast not a fan more like buttery cinnamon bread didn t get the sense of an egg bread combo at all would give it a 1 5 at best the fried chicken biscuit was good with the honey hot sauce my wife had the hot mess it was tasty it was good but not worth the wait
717,good breakfast pancakes were nice and fluffy cinnamon roll was awesome denver omlette was ok hashbrowns we re just ok as well stick to the carbs here,drake does a great job cutting my hair i have seen him twice now and he will definitely be my go to guy the shop is in a great location on state street fun to people watch from the chair old school vibe in the shop chill

719,this hotel was fabulous the interior and exterior have been carefully restored the hotel provides several light shows a night in their bar which also has table service and they have another fire and water show in a pond behind the pool plenty of restaurants are in walking distance i was here for a conference so the hotel catered a lot of our meals the food was really good except one meal where the food was cold but i m giving them 5 stars anyway because the rest was phenomenal
720,i love the bartenders so sweet and so charming brielle by far is the best so sociable and very charismatic i always try to grab a beer when she is around
721,pretty good got the breakfast burrito nothing special but tasty enough what i truly appreciate is their array of hot sauces including el yucateco which is delicious i have had their shrimp and grits and their banana foster french toast before as well and it is pretty good in my opinion one of the better breakfast places in the city it is always busy in the morning but when we showed up around 2 00 in the afternoon on a weekday and there was no wait if you have a weekday off and you want breakfast for lunch then come check out surrey s around then
722,excellent meal excellent atmosphere friendly staff we stopped in on a tuesday night for dinner we easily found a couple seats at the bar the bar staff were friendly and helpful the wine and beer selections were a mix of florida local and afar the bartender was knowledgeable about the menu and the each meals ingredients the kitchen easily made a modification to a meal for me the tuna tartar was amazing flavorful and pretty our meals were delicious
723,i went there yesterday with a buddy of mine to get a pair of yeezy 350 boosts checked and the guy was very helpful and provided his expertise without hassle would recommend the store to anybody intrested in desirable footwear or clothing
724,my new favorite ice cream spot the mexican twinky is amazing this will not be my last visit they have water based as well as cream based so if you want a guiltless treat as my husband did you can go with one of their fruit sorbets our little girl got the strawberry cream and it was really good also much better than your average strawberry ice cream staff was super friendly and the store was very clean and bright great spot
725,we are staying at the wyndham and it s just about a 10 minute walk to this little beach bar and grill we were seated fast and served delicious food we had two appetizers calamari and crap dip they both were awesome entrees were ahi tuna bowl and grilled grouper tacos you will not be disappointed fantastic food

732,a must do in stl absolutely love the great pumpkin and the big apple they are concretes with a slice of pie blended in you get these nice chunks of goodness in there and it s so delicious and fun to eat i like the terramizzou as well my dog gets a kiddie bowl of plain custard and he loves it so very much lines can be really long but don t let them scare you it moves fast

752,i love this park been there a many times with my ginger recently i ve encountered aggressive dogs which i ve decided to take a break my dog was bit in the face by a dog and the woman walked away with little to no care i want to report this to the head of the park to make awareness of this type of behavior does anyone know where i would go for such
753,i had their strawberry crepes and the grindhouse freddo by far 10x s better than any starbucks coffee i will for sure be enjoying this again
754,i ve been to all of the clear sky restaurants in clearwater and while they all have a different style and are all better at different things clear sky on cleveland is my favorite of the bunch while there is a bustling bar with tvs for sportscasting clear sky on cleveland has a more upscale feeling than the other locations and the menu caters to that distinction you ll find some pricier albeit more adventurous items on this menu but every single thing i ve tried has been top notch delicious the very first item i tried on our first visit was a grilled octopus appetizer it was served was shishito peppers garlic spread chimichurri sauce and crustinis to dip with normally octopus can become very rubbery very quickly but this dish is served at a perfect tenderness i would order this dish every single time if the menu wasn t so large in addition to the great menu they also always have great beers on tap go check them out
755,this custard is good so is culvers that being said when you order a tart cherry custard for your daughter who wants pink custard and can t have strawberries only to see strawberries in her custard a couple minutes after she s been eating it then being told by the teenage boy with a sarcastically dirty look you just now noticed not the best customer service skills yeah i just noticed because my daughter was eating it not me i didn t see any when i handed it to her and then he proceeds to begrudgingly request they make an actual tart cherry custard ugh frustrating
756,was here when they first opened for a happy hour and only had the griddled corn cake which i remember being really yummy but hadn t been back until last week when a friend suggested we meet here for dinner their guacamole is fresh and delicious i like the corn chips better than the flour i got the anaheim tacos that have shrimp and grilled anaheim chilis they were very tasty i got them with a side of rice and beans which were pretty standard to most mexican restaurants next time i think i d try the mexican beans that my friend got and liked i tried a bite of her tostadita with sweet potato and pork which was delicious this place is not your typical gringo fied mexican restaurant they have fresh takes on traditional dishes i can t wait to go back and try something different next time
757,my husband and i stopped in here for a quick late lunch on our way home and we are stoked we did i got brisket chili with cornbread and a pickle yes and my husband got a pulled pork sandwich on brioche with a side of baked beans to go except we didn t make it out of there once we got our food because it smelled so damn delicious plenty of nicely sized chunks of brisket in my chili nice and hot and just really really good my husband s sandwich was literally gone in 1 5 minutes and i m sure he was sad it was already over it looked incredible and there was a generous amount of pork on that puppy and smoke s vinegar bbq sauce is to die for this pregnant lady was sipping it out of the single serving cup and wishing it was a bowlful seriously the bbq sauce of my dreams also these guys know what s up and have super nice toilet paper in their bathroom as i need to pee every 5 minutes this seriously made my day that s all go get some bbq here it s killer please pick me up some too
758,harlow is by far the absolute best salon in town i have very challenging hair super thick naturally curly kinky frizzy poofy overall yuck and shana is quite literally the only stylist i trust implicitly she not only has 20 yrs experience there s something to be said about that she s also down to earth and easy to talk to and her expertise is absolutely unparalleled over the years i ve strayed for various reasons relocation laziness general stupidity and i regret it every time there s a reason shana s in such high demand just check out her results on instagram p s shana s the epitome of style true story we actually went to the same high school graduated the same year although we didn t hang out or even have any classes together i totally remember shana b c even in the 90 s the girl had style she always looked so pretty and perfect even way back in the day
759,the mcdonalds in caseyville is the best my daughter has strep throat and i let her pick what she wanted for dinner of course she chose mcdonald s i just want you to know i went thru the drive thru excellent service the young lady even double checked my order the young lady who handed me the food asked me to pull forward because she wanted to me to get fresh fries she apologized i was thrilled to get crispy chicken and hot fries at mcdonalds your young ladies all three of them took such good care of me they all looked and acted very professional so proud of how this mcdonald s is run great job guys my daughter said the food hit the spot
760,let s just start with the basics even though nothing is basic about this place the staff so amazing and attentive oh boy the crab cake was so wonderful i mean wonderful the best i ever had in new orleans lamb chops red fish creamed spinach was so delicious i wanna go everyday if i could,my favorite gem i love this place it s small with only a few tables so sometimes u won t be able to get a seat but that s the only problem other then that it s delicious the best u ever had and the sliders are delicious plz give them a try
761,i went last night with a few friends and let me say i was impressed not necessarily with the quality of the food nothing wrong with it by any means or the decor but the servers how they don t kill every 4th customer is beyond me i heard tables on both sides of us giving the most ridiculous of complaints to our their server both tables were demanding as hell and already said loudly to eachother that they weren t tipping because of x y and z reasons and then were dumbfounded that there s a gratuity on their bill it says it in the menu anything over 50 their server smaller girl so with purple hair carried upwards of 4 plates at once explained the menu perfectly and had an eagle eye for every table in her section and dealt with ridiculous complaints like a true professional thumbs up and five stars to the staff customers learn how to be basic humans or stay home
762,after all the years of being regulars of staying at the peppermill last night was the worst we always stay in the tuscany suites and although we love them the walls are paper thin we always ask for a room farthest from the elevators because of the drunks going down the halls late at night and being crazy loud we were there midweek this time so it was lovely at night nice and quiet until the fire alarm ripped into our room for 5 minutes straight at 2 30am we understand the alarm for emergencies but we would ve appreciated an all clear announcement after the fact we laid in bed after being awoken from a deep sleep not knowing if we had to evacuate or what have a little bit more respect for your clients who are staying in your hotel wondering what s going on
763,my boyfriend and i got the house off the roll as an omelette with home fries instead so good and not greasy at all just some really good bad food without feeling gross afterwards i m normally a pancake girl but the french toast here is hands down king everything we ate was very homestyle and clean great service with friendly and helpful staff
764,we were in nashville with friends and were looking for something with varied options for all of our different tastes nectar is only 10 min away from opryland so we chose this place and we were not disappointed love the concept of to go cafe with coffee and smoothies on one side and full restaurant on the other it is located in a renovated old house the decorations are simple yet effective and attractive our party had 4 kids with ages ranging from 9 15 they had a blast out in the backyard play area there were several things for them to occupy themselves with corn hole frisbee golf and the hook game just to name a few they have a full bar and we grabbed a drink while we waited for our table their on tap margaritas are definitely on point very fresh tasting without that sweet bottled mixer taste the moscow mules were good and they had multiple craft beers on tap to choose from the fresh chips and salsa were good as was the guacamole and queso we ordered to go with it we had an order of the nachos with chorizo that was perfect we ordered a variety of items for dinner the burrito bowl was excellent as were the steak burrito and pork shoulder taco the ceviche was very fresh tasting the orange chili plantains were absolutely awesome just the right amount of seasoning on everything the kids menu worked for all of our picky kid eaters they had an order of pinwheels to share which were good however i probably would warm those just a bit all in all a great choice for dinner and it is too bad we don t have this place in our town as it would definitely be a favorite and a frequent for us it is clear the owners work hard to make this place happen as they are out on the floor waiting tables and serving people helping out their servers all the wait staff were cheerful and pleasant we will definitely return the next time we are in nashville
765,the food is extremely fresh and most of the workers are nice but the first two people when you tell them what you want were rude i had never been here and was confused and they were talking down to me and being very condescending however everyone else was very nice
766,the restaurant is really nice the food is okay the waitstaff isn t good at all took so long to get one drink that we didn t even have time to order a second ordered apps and food and half way through our main course we got our drinks it was okay i wouldn t recommend it but it s okay
767,typical wawa location with quick reliable service and standard options to choose from clean location and friendly staff
768,i love this place every single thing i ve had here is good and fresh they do take a little longer than a grab and go but thats what fresh requires staff is very friendly and the decor is beautiful the owner s take pride in their place and it shows caution you will become addicted lol
769,held a baby shower here recently for my daughter marissa was very helpful in the planning and i think everyone enjoyed themselves we used the main dining room and bar area the brunch food we chose was plentiful and mostly yummy although the grits were a bit bland we had sampled the shrimp and grits which were very good when scouting the place but the cheesy grits i had on that date did not compare however the rest of the food including sausage bacon eggs and pancakes was yummy i wish their pastries included some kind of iced cinnamon roll mostly because that s a favorite of mine but also because it would have been more festive than the small muffins which were a bit dry the glazed donut roll was good though the only real issue was that the drink station serve themselves coffee and hot water in thermal vessels and juices plus champagne to make mimosas was not out until about 30 minutes after guests arrived and the juice carafes were very small almost like what you d place on one table so kept needing refill i think when it appears like there is only a small amount guests will be influenced to not take much out of politeness so should look plentiful also twice when i went for coffee it was empty although they did refill it when asked the staff was very pleasant the bartender was helpful and good about our taking up his entire bar top i d highly recommend this as a party venue or just as a good brunch place
770,special and vegas rolls are really good eel hand roll is also fabulous eel sauce is still my favorite sauce
771,great food awesome service also have local beers on menu nice place tried the pizza salad wings and cheese bread food was delicious
772,we had a great experience at katie s everything we ordered was exceptionally good even the kids meals the service was great and we enjoyed the atmosphere it s a local spot tucked away in a quiet neighborhood well worth the visit we will most definitely be back
773,wow best service i have ever experienced these guys are true grms they did not once try and jack me around they were super professional and extremely fair this is the only place i will ever take my car for repairs i highly recommend sierra car care thanks for getting my car safe
774,great location we travel from la and walk from santa barbara train station to the hotel 3 blocks not bad we have a room in the second floor and was nice and quiet very clean room and bed was comfortable walking distance to all the restaurants and night life the only concern is about the homeless people around the area but i guess that s all over the down town
775,as an update to my previous review we had tried the pizza tonight and it was delicious the crust is light thin and tasty the sauce is sweet and spicy mozzarella and provolone is the perfect combination of cheese just add those amazing meatballs and you have a wonderful pie
776,terrific new italian restaurant just west of the main section of downtown collingswood the waitstaff is very well trained and made lots of recommendations and knew the menu i tried the prix fixe for restaurant week tasty creative seasonal dishes the snapper with blueberry and mango salsa and roasted veggies was great staff is really friendly love sitting in the porch on a summer evening
777,the ambience and food are great i enjoyed the old village lebanese style architecture the food was on the expensive side but definitely well worth it for the quality i highly recommend the home made drinks especially the homemade jallab i m looking forward for the restaurant to open
778,amazing service we wanted to express our gratitude and appreciation especially to bert he was great help to us being our first time and then to find out he s the director he runs this place beyond what you would normally expect from a fast food joint he made this place a happy environment all staff was very happy to help and even came around to fill our drinks we weren t only blown away at the service but the food is amazing definitely our new favorite place even has a kid jungle gym for the kids thank you again joshua and ashlee
779,fantastic breakfast burrito and cold brew coffee kind service too food took a while but well worth it
780,don t get me wrong the donuts were delicious but i thought the process was extremely difficult when you go to a make your own donut joint you go for the experience and their clip board was not doing it for me the amount of items on the clipboard seemed overwhelming and i was instantly confused i was also extremely disappointed that you could only get one topping i was really excited to let my almost two year old load up his donut as a special treat come to find out he could only add sprinkles the donuts were tasty but in my opinion it isn t worth a drive the experience just didn t do it for me
781,such a cute shop and the owner is so nice she recommended a lot of spots around the city for us too go check out this shop for all of your souvenir needs
782,eggs veney i would eat this over and over dressed in suit for brunch most were casual dress with some wearing shorts jazz band was very good
783,mall location but a lovely interior setting ample free parking adjacent in a parking structure tall tables seem to be less desirable and we had no reservation so that s what we got but once i managed to hop up onto the really high seat all was well quick service decent salsa complimentary with warm chips the food however is fairly bland carne asada tacos served fajita style consisted mainly of a small but hot metal dish of over cooked cheese and a ton of lettuce and shredded radish meat was cooked as requested but was not very flavorful even the table side guacamole requested hot was blah cheesy lots of sauce but not a ton of flavor on the other entrees rice and beans are served family style in tiny little dishes that are hardly family sized they ll bring you more though entrees are about 20 it s fine it s mexican food in florida just had a beer so i can t comment on the signature margaritas but they had a page of them on the menu
784,this salon is very relaxed and comfortable i very rarely have a good experience at nail salons but this one was great at other salons i ve been to the quality ends up being cheap and come off after a few days but my current nails have yet to disappoint me i m so i love with them and i ve had them for almost a week the only problem i even have from them is some are shaped oval and some are almond
785,this was my favorite place on my trip to nola the service was the best i ve ever had gave a 30 tip very attentive and went though the entire menu the tuna appetizer was spectacular especially with caviar on top i also loved my catfish sandwich great flavor and very lightly breaded this will be a place i come to each time i m in nola they also give you complimentary bread bit on the pricier side for a lunch but oh so worth it
786,this place just keeps getting better the people there are so nice and they make a heck of a taco they just added seating inside as well as more produce perfect for anyone in the nations they are are also starting to serve bongo java coffee on their coffee bar as well as a large assortment of rishi tea highly recommend stopping in and becoming a regular
787,i ve been having a hard time finding a place that does decent al pastor tacos ever since i ve moved to tucson so far this place has been the most satisfying that paired with the fish taco made the experience pretty great the size of the tacos could be larger but i think the purpose is to remain faithful to the culture kudos
788,great drinks excellent beignets music was fantastic and an all around good vibe very relaxing and a great place to enjoy with the family
789,this is my favorite coffee shop love the atmosphere and the coffee and food are excellent if you go for breakfast you have to try the bacon biscuit sandwich whenever we come to tampa to visit this is at the top of our list on where we have to stop
790,what a wonderful way to wake up on saturday morning and do my pre workout breakfast the staff was lovely and delightful as i sneezed my way thank you allergies thru ordering i got the traditional boostin bowl and added a little nutella just cause i was feeling sassy delicious delicious delicious its almost like you ve stopped at the frozen yogurt store yet you know everything inside of it is absolutely good for you also got an extra half a cup of coffee on the way out asked of course and if course wasn t an issue i highly recommend
791,typical bar with bar food and clientele slightly above dive bar level but not swanky by any means service was good they had a dj and the music was louder than it needed to be but wasn t deafening the drinks were good and they have different specials everyday but were out of a lot of beers because their keg was broken or something the food was decent but nothing spectacular the mozzarella sticks look a lot better than the way they taste but the mac and cheese balls and brisket sandwich were good what did annoy me and always annoys me anywhere it happens is when i ask for a side of ranch and then get the check and find out i got charged for it i get that it s not a lot of money but it s ridiculous when an establishment is that petty that they need to charge an already paying customer who ordered a decent amount of food and drinks for a condiment to go with their bland food that is what happened here and i find it to be a turn off oh but don t worry the ketchup is free for those of you who like to violate your food with it
792,it s a decent park near the bay our major issue is we get there 10 mins before 5 pm on a saturday and the water shut off at 5 pm no signs on site or info online stating that there s a sign saying push a button however it didn t work not cool when you bring your kids to splash around in the water the playground equipment is fine except worn down and some metallic sharp edges be careful with your kids to avoid getting any injuries
793,not sure why it took until now for us to find this place we started out going to the chain lobster restaurant but wanted something more authentic a friend recommended lobster haven and i checked it out online looked like a type of place we would eat at in massachusetts when we visit family we were not disappointed service was great fast and very friendly huge selection of all of the favorites you have to visit this place if you want authentic new england seafood you can also purchase live lobster and fresh seafood to go and cook it yourself
794,i agree with the fast friendly service just stopped by for a quick carry out and was pleasantly surprised i was in and out in record time once i got home and unwrapped my treasures i saw the portion size yay jackpot for someone like me who likes to pig out i had the grilled beef bahn mi and it was excellent i may order that without the jalapenos since they are quite strong and fiery otherwise the taste is just wonderful also ordered the vermicelli with beef which was quite big and equally tasty yes i will be back to discover more items on their menu
795,i went here not expecting much because the other reviews weren t too good i thought the staff was very friendly the cashier and another lady that helped me were both very nice to deal with the food was good and both of my to go orders were accurate i do think the portions are a bit small for the price but that s not this individual locations fault i would definitely return to this location again
796,food was excellent drinks were terrific service was great
797,who opened this bar can i be your friend good design awesome staff and even better drinks get the hotel nacional
798,rush bowls has literally so many options in smoothies and bowls to choose from and you can even customize a bowl to your own liking based on a smoothie from their menu the portion sizes are huge so big that you can definitely split with a friend or savor it for two meals their fruit is super fresh and the granola is quite tasty prices are very reasonable considering the quality of their ingredients staff is very friendly and super helpful if you re at a loss picking out something from the menu parking is easy there s a lot right next door with 1 hour free
799,new to reno and was looking for a salon to keep up my hair it s literally down the street from me and they have late appts i love the products they use i ve had been dying my hair since 2015 their products don t sting my head and my hair feels great afterwards it can be a tad pricey but their products are more natural and chemical free i feel it s worth it check them out,otf is a great place for everyone of all fitness levels to workout from just starting out to the elite athletes they give a great variety of exercises no same routine twice in a week we use the treadmill and rowers all the time and it s always different the coaches are awesome and will push you to be your best even if you don t feel like working out still go and you ll feel better afterwards
800,on my limited time in santa barbara i wanted to both enjoy california wine and watch the sunset over the water this location offered both i enjoyed a rose while watching the colors change over the water the location is a little small so you might have to stake out a larger table if you re a bigger party but i was surprised to pretty easily catch a good table on my own granted it was a sunday night though
801,south philly favorite with great pastas chicken and veal dishes make a reservation to be safe as it is a local and tourists favorite well worth it too
802,this place has the best food ever we were treated to lunch and tried one of their lunch specials it was great fantastic job i give this place two thumbs up and bucks are well spent here is not too expensive and it s just under your budget and anyone can eat there and it s absolutely delicious i highly recommend it
803,a peer brought some different donuts and they were awesome will stop by my way home to get some
804,never a disappointment exceptional service high quality food good portions and reasonable pricing no wonder it s hard to get a weekend table
805,amazing restaurant cute and cozy service was fast and very kind boyfriend and i came here on a thursday during mardi gras weekend and it was the best place we ate the whole trip the shrimp and grits is an essential order
806,three sisters is a pretty good restaurant we have eaten lunch here in the past and i would rate the lunch a 5 5 the breakfast we ate there recently was only a 3 5 so the restaurant receives an average score of 4 5 for two visits
807,clean sports bar at the beach with pool darts a huge shuffle board table good prices and cold beer plenty of tvs so you can watch whatever sport is on will definitely be returning
808,five star just for the the completely addicting and totally unfair to blow your diet bread pudding the other dishes are very good too but the bread pudding is just the best i ve ever had having a student at webster conservatory of the arts i can say i truly love going to see the shows and cyrano s was a must afterwards
809,stopped in right after flying in and this will probably now be my first stop coming out of msy from now on fresh bread for the sandwich and quality stuff
810,great service food came out in a timely manor and it didn t hurt that there was a groupon for it my food even came with a free drink just for checking in this place was very clean and the owner is also very nice and friendly and will check up on you love the food and service at this place
811,via marconis is always a good time lots of beers on tap and a robust menu the pizza is good and the sandwiches make for good pub grub
812,shane was the best we will definitely come back for him came in for a bachelorette and he was attentive funny and helpful on suggesting fun places around the city to check out we feel lucky having him
813,came to nola for a few days and this was our favorite restaurant everything was delicious service was incredible i highly recommend saving room for dessert both the creme brle and bread pudding were worth every calorie
814,discovered this place while searching yelp for something else and i m so glad i did went today for the first time it s so fantastic i had the chicken tacos i m hoping and suggested they try a steak option and my friend had the gazpacho shrimp soup i think it s a soup anyway both meals were delicious i couldn t even come close to eating all 3 tacos but they were super yummy
815,this place is pretty good for a couple of things the brussel sprouts and the cooked oysters i ve tried many other main courses that just didn t wow me and took off stars for that service was good at least
816,at first glance it didn t look appealing but once you walk in and get settled the atmosphere will change and the food will speak for itself the owner tita was really welcoming and friendly and very funny the food was worth the wait and this restaurant is for sure a hidden gem in reno we stayed in gsr so it was only a 6 minute drive so it s very convenient and they serve breakfast all day simply put come here to have a good home cook meal and i would come back next time ps they give two eggs on their silogs which is a plus in my opinion and the halo halo was bomb
817,i attended pma s risk management professional prep course and simply put it was excellent between the outstanding instructor karl cheney and pma s tools on their website i was able to pass on my first attempt i would recommend this course to anyone preparing for any pmi certification
818,i attended this place for the first time yesterday afternoon after breaking one nail yesterday morning by the end of the day i had broken every single one once it happens to one it s game over ya feel me ladies anyways i was able to make an appointment online and get in right after work the place is so quaint and cute the decor is perfect shabby chic and so calming they have a good color selection but not too many where they hand you a bucket of 300 colors that all look the same for you to dig through i appreciated that it gets too overwhelming the girl i made an appointment with wasn t quite done with her prior client and one of the owners starting soaking off my nails amazing and so so sweet the conversation was great and most importantly my manicure looks amazing i had dip on prior to coming in so my nails were incredibly weak so she gave me some tips and was so careful overall amazing experience definitely recommend
819,i come here often and everything is always great i love the happy hour specials daily with cheap prices and great food and drink and all the chips and salsa the staff is always great too
820,when in new orleans cafe on the square is my favorite spot for breakfast the portions are worth your money and incredibly tasty also try to make it back for happy hour 3pm 7pm 5 mozzarella cheese croquettes are to die for
821,tiny restaurant with delicious food and great staff we had the carne asada plate and a wet carne asada burrito both were super flavorful and plentiful in portion size for not a lot of money amazing chips with large salsa bar probably best pico de gallo i ve ever had vegetables diced super small which i prefer to larger chunks the staff is super friendly and accommodating a woman was waiting for her food and one of staff brought her a chair and offered her a seat will definitely return
822,i should know better than to try to eat a bagel in california at 9am it wasn t empty but not busy we were the only ones waiting for food it took them 15 minutes to toast a mediocre bagel and put it in a box with capers cream cheese and onions pre packaged separately based on the 5 days prior date scrawled in sharpie on the plastic cup they forgot my tomatoes not very cute for the mom and pop vibe they have going barista was fast at least good latte and cold brew i should have just ordered a pastry though
823,if you re a lover of good food and lots of choices this restaurant is for you number 1 dish of the night the burger my oh my it was one of my top 3 of all time also tried the short rib mac cheese crawfish dip fried green tomatoes beef stroganoff rotisserie short rib brussels sprouts and shrimp andouille croquettes dessert special of the night was a chocolate chip skillet cookie with ice cream side note my friends and i didn t eat all day after reading over this menu in anticipation of our reservation my favorite dishes were the burger brussels sprouts crawfish dip and fried green tomatoes service was great and the drinks were strong do yourself a favor and visit this place
824,this place is sadly perm closed i was hoping not however the phone is now disconnected
825,pucketts is really a great southern restaurant you ll get friendly service and so many great food and drink options my personal favorite meal so far is the smoked meatloaf this is not anything like mama s meatloaf it is a combo of their brisket and pulled pork i love that the topping is not too sweet it s so good makes it difficult to try other dishes but you may also want to try a burger with the pimento cheese yum they have great seasonal cocktails and my current favorite is the honey i m home it tastes like the perfect light summer drink their weekend live music is always great as well great food great people
826,love eating here every time i m in the area today we enjoyed a excellent breakfast my husband ordered the full order of pancakes it was gigantic service is always as swift as possible its always busy and very good
827,i highly recommend this treatment first joyce was fabulous second no pain whatsoever i was told i might have some warmth or redness afterwards had none this new kind of laser is amazing on the bikini area third this was my first treatment my hair barely grew back now i have decided to tackle other areas
828,our 3rd time in and yet to be disappointed brunch is excellent bloody mary s are awesome and a good selection of them awesome place awesome service definitely recommend giving it a shot
829,i love this boutique and the incredibly generous and kind owner the shoes and bags are so unique and wonderful you have to go in at least just to look around i recently bought a liebeskind purse from her she was soooooo helpful and patient it took 2 different visits for me to finally decide i wanted to purchase it and she couldn t have been more sweet about it all i encourage people to go in just to chat with her and look around it ll leave you in such a great mood i always leave there happy whether i ve purchased something or not
830,every time i visit plant city i make it a point to get a little pampering done here everyone is so nice and super attentive i almost hate to give them a good review because i don t want them to be too busy for me next time i m in town
831,wonderful hotel filled with eclectic art furniture colors and other stuff very clean everything worked it is centrally located to philadelphia s historic sites which was extremely convenient making important points of interest just a short walk away the staff especially our new friends chris bellman and ronald registration blew my mind with friendly thoughtful attention to detail my 9yo daughter loved to head to the registration room the living room each day to chat with chris and ronald and the other phenomenal people working there aka staff she would then sit on the various furniture by the lit fireplace and write in her journal about the day s activities as a parent that is very satisfying to watch when you come ask the reception team about the history of it it s much better when told in person than reading about it we will definitely be returning for this experience if we come to philly again
832,interesting place to visit the lady that greeted us was friendly and funny seem like the kind of person you can sit down with and go on for hours the museum itself educates you about what voodoo is really about and not what you see on a hollywood screen would i go here again yes would i recommend it to someone depending on the person
833,i m usually a chilaquiles girl so the huevos rancheros sounded sort of tempting with its eggs tortillas and salsa combination now huevos rancheros in general has never really appealed to me but tavern had me changing my tune i have a feeling that no other restaurant s version of this dish will impress me as much as this one but if you are in nashville and you are at tavern for brunch and you don t get the huevos rancheros you re making a huge mistake one of the best brunch meals of my life y all
834,booom what a place this is the place and i found it great place atmosphere and of course the food and drinks thank you for the great service
835,a group of 7 of us went here on a thursday night the service was terrible the waiter was so curt and kind of rude it also charges 2 per bottle of beer you open there even though the place is byob i wish we had known that before we went because my friend was not happy about that the rest of us had wine and it wasn t that bad the food was pretty cheap a noodle dish with seafood came out to 10 with tip which is pretty decent but whatever i ordered was incredibly underwhelming it was the order 1 under the noodle category in the menu the other dishes were better but i was unimpressed i would not go back especially since service was so bad
836,had a really good time the staff and wait staff were incredibly friendly and helpful the grouper was fantastic my wife really enjoyed her shrimp tacos and my son loved his seafood too if the weather permits eat outside by the fishing boats it is very relaxing and a great ambiance good food good service and great views and music
837,drove from i 10 to try this place out glad we did i had a flight of 6 different flavors and my friend had the brownie sundae we both highly recommend also the employees were excellent help
838,solid farm to table type offerings with some tasty flavors but nothing it s namesake who i presume to be ernest hemingway would write home about based on a recommendation we joined some friends at hemingway s for dinner we began our meal by sharing the duck poutine which will be described below and the crispy brussel sprouts with our friends the brussel sprouts were phenomenal the combination of the heavy char on the brussel sprouts the spicy cranberry glaze peanuts onion and parmesan were delicious for dinner my wife and i opted to share some of hemingway s small plates we had the duck poutine the risotto and the kale salad interestingly the star of our selections was the kale salad it offered a very fresh and clean complement to the more savory risotto and poutine selections the risotto was composed of butternut squash apple walnuts and goat cheese which was tasty but just satisfactory the duck poutine was also tasty but it needed more cheese curds and more duck all in all we were satisfied with hemingway s and we believe it to be a restaurant worth trying but it is not a star of the nashville dining scene
839,i was surprised that this place had a decent selection of vegan options substitutes the vegan fried chicken po boy was tasty my friend ordered the vegan pulled pork made out of seitan and he wasn t a fan but he loved the big ass biscuit it s a very hipster vibe i plan on coming back to try out other menu options
840,i i had an amazing meal at smoke the staff was so friendly and the ribs were amazing i highly recommend smoke bbq
841,the drinks were good and had a good amount of liquor in them they had 2 pianists playing the night we went and they played current music like new beyonce and usher it was really entertaining to watch we eventually left when it got too crowded because people were bumping into each other overall the drinks were accurately priced with a good amount of liquor and the entertainment was great we would definitely come back on a less busy night
842,besides 6 separate customers coming in when the doors open at 10 30am they have ordering directions on a cut sheet for you great idea even if it is the chipotle model with middle eastern food clean and crisp ambience decor and ordering process with friendly service the food is great healthy fast food although those who read my reviews know i m not a big fan of franchises i m betting naf naf is and i m all in nafon
843,where to begin the cheesesteaks were amazing better than philly imo the bread was primo the steak was cooked perfectly and the provolone was the perfect topping i always get it with onion the cool thing is they have multiple types of cheesesteaks and they have different sizes if you re not too hungry i love the beer options and wine selection they have multiple drafts and plenty of bottles to choose from the inside is nice and school oriented my wife had their oval and really enjoyed it oval oval shaped pizzas overall everyone at the table enjoyed what they ordered and there was no need for a to go box
844,the best donuts i ve have in my life im not a donut fanatic but i d eat these donuts any day they have such a wide variety of flavors that pair so well with the donuts i got the strawberries champagne donut and the blackberry blackpepper donut i love the combination of the flavors the donuts are huge worth the money i also love the vibe of the place and the service
845,the breakfast culture club changed my life super tasty coffee snacks and treats absolutely love their attention to detail design and their customer service is top notch they serve different kinds of specialty roasts including a delicious avocado toast they carry a revolving selection of coffee roasters coava is their current based in portland there are great work spaces plenty of outlets and a couch area to relax and read
846,such delicious gelato had the macadamia lavender and sweet amish milk flavors the sweet amish milk was the best one out of those three flavors to me
847,40 of us descended on the place after a workout was absolutely excellent the food was perfect and well prepared it would make any alterations you requested in the menu the service was terrific there was a bit of a wait but really 40 of us what would you expect i don t know what s going on in the neighborhood its a breath of fresh air the food portions were perfect to keep one in line with a good healthy meal bar was refilled and refilled and refilled also the cost wasn t much more than they paid for at a fast establishment like starbucks and the quality was immaculately superbly better this may be our go to place after a hard workout ymmv but ours was superb
848,i have been to the ace in portland but this was much better queen b amor offered extra special table service on a busy night during jazz fest what a gorgeous location warm hospitality and memorable evening i must go back
849,super crowded moves along pretty fast took our deli lunch out back under the trees very nice
850,wooter ice yes that s how you re supposed to say it skip out on rita s john s water ice is the place to be if you want the true philadelphian icy dessert i like the simplicity here from the name of the joint to the small layout to the menu to the actual product it s straight creamy delicious ice cream with wooter ice i thought that the pineapple flavor with butter pecan ice cream was extra delicious the peach wooter ice tasted a little weird so you might not be missing much if you don t get it solution ask for a sample don t miss out on this joint whether you live here or just visiting
851,amazing service and hospitality tony and renee made us feel like one of the locals even taking time to show us pacific northwesterners how to properly eat crawfish and it was wonderful the chefs shrimp balls were fabulous and he came out of the kitchen to say hello if you go for the swamp tour stop in before for a bucket of beer on ice and then stop back in after for delicious food and great company
852,this place was tiny packed and full of amazing flavors i went in for breakfast by myself and the atmosphere was great i had the cafe fleur de lis omlet which was amazing and peach mimosas my food was delicious my drinks were heavily poured i sat amd read without glares and the bill wasn t too high definitely a new favorite of mine
853,come for the empanadas stay for the cocktails really fabulous food also had the paella which was delicious i dream about the empanadas very trendy space with an amazing rooftop patio wish they took open table reservations i d eat here every weekend
854,great space with fabulous st louis themed art try the meatball pizza arancini and the gelato we will definitely be back
855,went to tacos 46 and then decided to check out this place definitely a hidden gem best parking is in the home depot lot and then enter through the first white door on the south side of the building as everyone says it s tiny but the kitchen is rocking with fun and food would recommend calling in your order as there is very little waiting room this is the first mexican taqueria i have found in this city that s worth traveling for torta bread was fresh and the carne asada has more flavor than any other place new favorite by far
856,our server was awful and because of her inattentive nature created a stressful dining experience the food was pretty good the rolls and dipping herbs were tasty our appetizer was really great and we enjoyed the honey orange glaze dip for the shrimp the salad is usually a delicious delight however the salad had way too much salad dressing and made the typically tasty salad a disappointment our food was served timely and was nice my meal was the salmon with vegetables and asparagus my spouse chose the steak with grilled vegetables and seasoned potatoes the potatoes were way overloaded in seasoning and made eating them a chore just like the salad our server did not check on us and we needed drink refills the three women seated at the table beside us had a different server who was very attentive to their needs we usually get dessert but was so aggravated by the end of our meal we opted out of dessert good service and appropriate seasoning is essential in making happy patrons in any dining experience
857,i stopped at the 7th sun brewery for a beer and was enjoying it outside when i caught a whiff of bbq i discovered the delicious smells were coming from eli s bbq just up the road so i changed dinner plans and went to eli s eli s is nothing fancy just an old time bbq shop there are a few picnic tables under the shade trees but it s mostly carry out the food is all bbq smoked in house or rather in the big smoker in the yard smoked pork ribs chicken and a few sides is all that s on the menu but it s all good note they are only open two days a week on friday and saturday afternoons and they do run out of food so get there early to avoid disappointment
858,jones brunch is amazing went with four friends and we got the all got bottomless bellinis which is a great deal they let it sit there for 2 hours while we drank as much as we could the mac and cheese is to die for monkey bread is a great appetizer for the table chicken and waffles was really good chicken was moist and and the skin was gently fried the syrup was nice and sweet the ambiance was great we have reservations and we were seated right away this place is vegetarian friendly the server was friendly only thing i regret is not trying their dessert
859,great burgers and fries as usual but the most important service was the the employees and management such an enjoyable meal with all the employees making sure you didn t have any problems we ll be back soon
860,we found this place while traveling on yelp thought we would try it due to high rating good food and friendly staff little confusing the first time you order opportunity exist to make it easier to order and prices otherwise 5 stars
861,i liked this restaurant because it seemed to be quintessential new orleans great location overlooking city park and beautiful cypress trees second floor has large shutter doors opening out to a deck with great park views great selection of house cocktails salad and entree were good but not particularly memorable the lemon posset was a bit of a miss in my opinion overall if in new orleans i would say give it a try the atmosphere alone is worth a visit
862,great food at a great value my favorite items on the menu are the pho pork bun bahn mi and the pot stickers are delicious the bahn mi comes on true french bread i recommend the pork belly as for pho i usually get the beef with extra bean sprouts pork bun is my favorite menu item it comes with vermicelli noodles cucumber carrots and more the best server there her name is tim ask for her if you want to get the best service
863,in town for a conference and decided to give this place a try loved it amazing drinks and food will definitely come back next year
864,solid reasonably priced indian cuisine i m from san diego here on business found bawarchi on yelp looking for lots of reviews and good rating they did not disappoint me i was the only european in the place that s a good sign the staff was hospitable and very friendly if i come back this way i will return
865,if your looking for something different some place unique to eat this would be it so you mix ice cream with a great atmosphere friendly staff and booze you have a winner we pulled up to the location thinking what this seemed a diamond in the rough until you walk inside place is full of happy customers hearing several rounds of happy birthday being sung lots and lots of choices on the menu ice cream was yum food even yummier not a word but going for it was seated quickly you blink and the waiter was there to answer questions about the menu which i asked plenty they have a a whole different menu i have ever seen in an ice cream parlor best to say if your 21 and older a must to try because they add liquor to their ice cream or is it they add ice cream to their liquor i m going with second statement this place was just cool different blends of ice cream i ve never tried before wished i could have sampled it all great staff ice cream and food arrived very quickly on top of the waiter several other staff members talked to us very open and friendly i d love to give this place another star if i could was that good
866,so glad to see that you have reopened after the fire and mudslides we love this restaurant and come every summer many times when we stay at the biltmore wonderful italian food whatever we have ordered we love can t wait to come back this summer
867,so this was my first restaurant that i tried when i came to philly for the first time their roti canai is the best that i ve ever tried that curry is soooo good their fried calamari is my sister s favorite here and it s decent for me i love their kangkung balancing because it s the exact same one that i had back in indonesia i was born in indonesia their rendang however doesn t match my tastebud their indian mee goreng is so good also i have a little trouble with the peanut sauce that they serve it s too sweet their coconut rice is just like regular white rice their service isn t the best for me but still okay probably clean the place a little bit more the third time i came it was like dirty like super dirty and i heard a customer complained about finding a fly inside their dish so that s kind of disappointing for me but i ll come back for their roti canai
868,my husband and i have wanted to try this place since we heard about it opening we love st elmo s and harry izzy s and i would say i was underwhelmed by burger study don t get me wrong the food was good but it wasn t outstanding like i find the food at their other restaurants we started with the beer cheese tot appetizer which was my favorite part of the meal our friend got the blt salad which was also very good we all ordered the homecoming burger which was okay also the fries are not very good i would definitely get the tater tots we will be back but i don t think this will be a regular for us
869,we have been here twice both times such a fun experience the food was delish also no complaints st all totally recommend i would also go with a big group to make it a fun experience
870,i have been going to bakery house for years and absolutely love it every time i usually get the chocolate chip cake it s my favorite
871,for a airport hotel restaurant it was pre darned good the hubs ordered shepard s pie and loved it he enjoyed that it was beef brisket and not hamburger so much more authentic that way he was very pleased i had the balt bacon avocado lettuce tomato it was so good loads of bacon i highly suggest it i had a draft beer i don t know what it is about this state but i swear we can t get a properly cooled and poured draft zero head and it was def not quite cold enough nonetheless i d suggest it s a terrific stop
872,so obsessed with this place love love love i was afraid the dough would be dry but it was perfect i would recommend the original chocolate chip dough
873,great location for getting bait and tackle before heading out to the skyway piers they ve always had shrimp and squid on hand each time i ve been here great little place
874,this is a fantastic place to get meats and other groceries a little on the pricey side but you getting better quality in most of the items the only drawback to mazzaro s is the parking if you go on the weekend expect a crowd
875,great food came out quickly with a lot of options including vegetarian choices loved the ricotta and honey all made in house also enjoyed the portabella mushroom pasta
876,the service was amazing and the food was well worth it definitely will be coming back to try more of their burgers
877,one of the nicer places in tucson if you like gambling obviously plenty of that but so much more we have stayed there a and enjoyed greatly especially thursdays and there free music night usually some pretty good cover bands and everyone has good time big pool and plenty of places to explore decent buffet if you like that would recommend you check it out
878,i ve passed by this place for a while and today i decided to stop in i m so mad i waited so long the cafe is fabulous the breakfast and cuban toast are like your momma would make and the atmosphere is great super sweet super helpful and the restaurant is so clean i think i ve found my new spot
879,awesome food but beware do not order through grub hub order directly from the restaurant website or call them grub hub placed my order as pick up after i specifically chose delivery the restaurant had to re make my food and get their own driver to bring me my food since i had no way of picking up
880,good food but the quality doesn t seem to justify the prices seems they should lower the price point by a dollar or two for the entrees 16 for a bowl seems a bit steep
881,perfect dinner spot went here tonight with one friend and got sat right away in a very nice private spot we only got appetizers and coffee and it was the perfect place for that great service and environment totally going to come back for more than appetizers
882,oh my yum these donuts were delicious and it was a fun atmosphere i got the margarita donut since it was cinco de mayo and my husband got a mexican hot chocolate donut the filling in the margarita donut was a little too tart for me but the hubby really enjoyed it we shared i would love to visit again and try some of the other creative donuts available
883,great atmosphere in the store great flowers wonderful produce all kinds of specialties the only weak spot is the prepared foods although the sushi is fine
884,this is my favorite bakery i feel like i m in france it s so charming my favorite is the chocolate dip madelines it s my crack i m addicted to them they always do fun theme desserts like harry potter month in fall or for the royal wedding where they made cake just like they served at the royal wedding
885,clearly we re not here for the atmosphere yet it s still the best mexican food anywhere although i no longer live in the area i still stop by when driving thru town even if i save a few chicken burritos for the coming days
886,wonderful sliders and amazing donuts this place is a must i got the pork belly slider and my husband got the hamburger slider yum
887,i love trader joe s lots of great snacks and goodies great food for tasting and just a fun environment overall this store is a pretty good size and although it doesn t sell alcohol like those in nj it s a nice store they have some signature items that are great and can t be found elsewhere such as green dragon sauce and chili spiced mangoes will be back in the future
888,very happy with the service and food here our waitress was super patient and helpful with helping us sample some wines she was knowledgeable about the items on the menu the vibe of the restaurant was a smooth jazzy feel i would definitely be returning
889,my wife and i ate here yesterday march 18 with an elderly friend who lives in the tucson area the friend loves this place for their chicken tortilla soup and she was not disappointed i had the cobb salad which was perfectly acceptable and better than a much more expensive one i d had the day before in particular the quality and quantity of the meat was impressive this review is mostly to recognize the efforts of our server and especially one of the managers bearded chap john who took great care of my wife who has numerous food sensitivities they answered her questions patiently and at one point john as we shall call him came out to discuss in detail the ingredients of the salad dressing collaboratively a good solution was found and my wife enjoyed her meal very much i have one primary suggestion for improvement turn the music down at least for the sunday lunch crowd the music seemed far louder than most customers likely wanted we will definitely return next time we re in tucson
890,this place is great very accommodating the office staff is nice and very helpful no issues with maintenance they do a great job and are very friendly only issue we have is the noise issue walls are paper thin but other than that we are happy
891,i was traveling with a party of six who wanted to taste the flavors of new orleans we just happened to stumble upon the creole house restaurant the atmosphere was great an opportunity to sit with friends and enjoy good food the customer service was remarkable as for the food every dish ordered by our party was superb
892,go for slick instaworthy decor tea served with dense creamy foam and cute vibes drawbacks with any new establishment there are growing pains long wait times to get the foam drinks 15 min but hopefully that will get worked out when they get into the swing of things also not all the cafe members know the menu that well ex i asked them the difference between uji matcha and regular matcha and only one member knew the difference apparently it s a different type of matcha still not sure on the specifics recommendations any drink with the matcha foam regular foam has a tangy aftertaste reminiscent of cheese cake that might be polarizing the matcha cream doesn t have that tangy note and tastes much sweeter and mellow additional notes credit cards are accepted
893,my boyfriend and i were visiting from ny and we saw this cute little spot and just has to try it we were expecting a huge wait but both times we went they sat us down immediately the hostesses were so extremely nice and accommodating to us wanting to sit outside the first time we went we went for breakfast my goodness the food was incredible we were so impressed that we made plans right then and there to make it our last stop of our trip on our way back to ny and that s exactly what we did this time we got lunch and yet again not disappointed at all i wish there was one of these closer to home
894,great atmosphere friendly staff and ownership incredibly fast very reasonable prices fantastic pizza create your own pizza with up to 6 toppings for 7 can t beat that quality and flavor is through the roof exact same concept as blaze pizza but higher quality ingredients found at slimms quality dipping sauces great variety to select from awesome place highly recommend also got in during the first hour of opening today and got free breadsticks
895,i can t speak for the food but the drinks are great what makes this little gem even more of a standout are the employees my boyfriend and i flew into for a quick weekend from florida and this place was around the corner from our hotel we were greeted right away by john one of the best bartenders i ve ever had and had to pleasure of meeting he made this place a standout kind courteous and friendly if we gained something more than a hangover from here it was a friend i him thanks for everything john you re the best
896,the peacock cafe is on of the on site eateries at grounds for sculpture it s much more affordable then some of its fancier counter parts indoor and outdoor seating is available the day we visited 2 gorgeous peacocks were parading around the seating area i ordered a fancy grilled cheese sandwich and shared fries with my friend the bread was perfection and there was a huge slice of tomato in the middle two different types of cheese the sandwich came with home made potato chips and was about 8 i m not a huge fan of potato chips but these happened to be outstanding we learned that they are made fresh every morning onsite would not hesitate to grab lunch here the next time i m visiting random side note my friend ordered a chicken salad sandwich the chicken salad contains lemons which i think is gross,we didn t stick around but we all got our fish bowls super cheap and strong too everyone was asking where we got them from
897,let me start with the positive the staff and customer service here is exceptional they will go out of their way to make things right for you and accommodate your needs however the hotel facilities they have to work with is in dire need of renovation the shower in our room dripped all night long the toilet would not flush properly consequently it repeatedly overflowed the tile in the bathroom was broken in several places and dirt had accumulated in the large chipped areas the facing on the bathroom sink had a huge crack and the toilet paper holder was falling out of the facing attempts to fix the facing was evident by spackle smeared near the crack and gloves of glue around the toilet paper holder the furniture in the living are was visibly soiled and the lamp shade in the bedroom was broke it s unfortunate that hilton does not renovate this hotel the staff was awesome and it would be a shame for them to lose business due to the outdated and falling apart facilities
898,the good wonderful service the waiter was professional and knowledgeable of the menu the halibut oh em gee the fish was good but the sauce was incredible the vibe was amazing didn t venture upstairs but had the view in front of the kitchen and loved the intimate feel cocktail if you like sweet drinks the midnight sun is popular and basically tastes like sparkling grape fruit juice the meh they gave us a sample of a dish made from their specially made grits and truffle oil cream sauce sauce was great but something about the grits mix tasted like glorified tater tots will i go back for sure especially since it s my hometown all in all had a good experience will definitely try some different things next time
899,had our first experience of a sushi burrito i picked the poke bowl but my boyfriend loved his very fresh sushi fish and delicious for a good price
900,brilliant chef moderate prices perfect beer grand rapids mi porter even better wine spain grenacha beet salad perfectly balanced acidity and sweetness ditto partner s strawberry salad sinful goat cheese u 10 scallops just perfection and only 22 as were tapas pork ribs and the long long long led zep stairway to heaven all the right notes culinary genius and great service in a hole in the wall bit of wonderful if this place were in boulder co they d be lined up down the block waiting to get in
901,can t beat it for the price tasty rolls and appetizers quick service definitely the best sushi i ve had at an all you can eat restaurant and they have a good variety,sushi burritos sound like a strange concept but they are absolutely delicious the shrimp crackers were also surprisingly good quick service reasonably priced for the good sized portions will definitely keep coming back
902,these tacos are amazing and the price of the food is very reasonable i actually don t love the atmosphere but i understand why it is what it is nashville has the theme of walking up to order and picking up your food and i suppose i m just the type of person who wants to be waited on so it doesn t seem so fast food like overall can t argue with the great taste of the food plus they have mix and match bucket of beers
903,if you want a little taste of new orleans this is the place to go i am from the south and have visited nola many times the mufaletta here was as good as any i have had in new orleans fried mac and cheese were also good food was out in no time definitely worth a stop
904,my first time there today we got the pulled pork sandwich meal with collard greens and corn on the cob it was fantastic will definitely be back
905,i was craving thai food so i found this place and decided to give it a try i went to their website to look at the menu and discovered they had online ordering i ordered my food green curry w white rice and a thai tea and when lunchtime came i went to the store to pick up my food when i got there i was pleasantly surprised to see that it was much nicer than other asian restaurants the atmosphere and ambiance is very relaxing and the staff were all dressed very professionally and had smiles on their faces the cashier greeted me and i paid for my food now even though i got there about 5 minutes before i was supposed to pick up my food it took longer than i would have liked i was waiting for about 10 minutes after my pickup time the curry was hot and smelt amazing and tasted even better it was very creamy and was a great sized portion i was disappointed with the white rice however it was gummy and not hot closer to lukewarm but when i mixed it with the curry it improved the rice my thai tea was ice cold and tastes amazing will definitely be back again to try their other food and give their rice a second chance
906,popped in here for a bite to eat during paddy fest and we definitely stumbled upon a treat the place is definitely upscale so a good choice for a romantic dinner special occasion dinner however they do have a full liquor bar and raw bar that is a little more relaxed they do have live entertainment however when we were there is was very loud due to march madness and other festivities happening we sat at the raw bar to have a snack while we tried to kill some time waiting for a show we were attending down the street we had the blue point oysters and the beef carpaccio that comes with a side of an arugula salad it was sooo fresh and sooo good highly recommend stopping in to have a bite if you are in the area and the oysters are to die for they were so clean and fresh and they also give you these cute little bottles of tabasco be aware a dozen blue point oysters will run you about 36 but it is totally worth it
907,it was the best of times it was the worst of times these words from dicken s a tale of two cities describe the haircuts that i ve gotten here my stylist jamie did a great job on my haircut today it was the best one that i ve ever had in this place color me happy on the other hand some of the other ones here have been mediocre and a few well awful remember folks we go to supercuts to get an inexpensive haircut for a reasonable price in this world you get what you pay for if i wanted a razor cut i d somewhere else and pay big bucks now i just want a simple haircut and supercuts is where i go they get three stars
908,i came in for happy hour 4 7pm i ordered the lobster shrimp tacos the 50 cent louisiana oysters the louisiana oysters surprisingly were pretty large in size they tasted really fresh it was great service the waiters were all very attentive unfortunately they did not have the fresh fruit tart desert so i was extremely disappointed that there were no other good options for desert
909,cut a couple of clubs down and took em in to have them gripped prompt service reasonably priced all in all a very pleasant experience
910,excellent time here went late right before closing 9 30 and the place was empty the amazing waitress courtney i think was very accommodating and even had the the cook take the heads off the shrimp at my request because it was slow i really appreciated the hospitality here overall i would go again and get the boiling house sauce
911,i got the bazooka toast it was amazing a little bit pricey but totally worth it so good it inspired me to give my first yelp review
912,i love this place everything is wonderful but the best part is they are sensitive to allergies my son is allergic to eggs which makes finding a birthday cake difficult or almost impossible but village bakehouse offers vegan cakes that can accommodate his allergy they always take down a list of his allergies and take care to ensure the cake is safe for him and to top it all off the cake is always delicious and amazing no one would ever know that it s not just a delicious cake and it makes my heart happy to get to see my little boy enjoying his birthday cake just like any other kid
913,delicious food the best beef patties i have had in a long time my only complaint is the never have roti and the expired juices
914,aj s how do i love thee fabulous everything great fresh fish in the middle of tucson and i live in coastal maine part of the year amazing meats as well their fresh food and salad section is awesome i m a cook cook but their curried chicken salad is probably better than mine they also have a fabulous variety of hot foods ready to go as well as sushi fantastic fresh produce and bakery
915,we went here for brunch and prices were 20 dollars a head we used our comps and got our meal for almost free the selection is pretty good as there is a salad bar roast beef and ham station with sausage they had a place to make pho as well thr breakfast was okay and the lunch portion like the fried chicken too overall not too bad for the price
916,cute little spot but expect to wait for a breakfast table check in through yelp so you don t have to wait long chicory coffee was delicious but not hot grits were runny which was surprising their biscuits were pretty amazing though
917,i have never been disappointed by them i have tried practically the entire menu and it has all been tasty great portion for the price and relatively quick service considering everything is cool to order nice hidden jewel on the northwest side of naptown
918,as far as car buying experiences go this was one of the better ones but still not stellar we went to purchase a new jeep for my wife and the salesman bruce was a pleasure to deal with and put some extra effort into trying to process some rebates we weren t sure about to see if we could still qualify and was really trying to go the extra mile for us the new jeep was to our liking but they couldn t meet our price so we left to have lunch nearby and the phone tag game started finally they met our price on one and we returned they didn t have porters or runners so our older salesman had to retrieve each vehicle that we looked at himself from the frozen lot and he was running himself ragged and we actually felt a bit bad for him and he also had to leave the premises to drive down to their other dealership himself to bring down the one we ultimately purchased that took up a lot of time and we spend way more time just waiting around than we would have liked lastly some vehicles had spare donut tires and some didn t even though it wasn t disclosed on the sticker so we had to wait for a spare to be retrieved to put into our vehicle before we finished signing away the final documents all in all it worked out in the end and we were extremely pleased w the brand new cherokee and the deal but just wished it all went a little faster in the end money talks and bs walks and they got us to the deal we were looking for also have to say the manager alphie stepped in and immediately made a couple things right for us when we did have some concerns that would have stalled the deal and we were pleased with that i would definitely consider buying another vehicle from them again going forward on a side note the internet ads all show a sale price for each new vehicle but in actuality they include extra rebates that most people won t ever qualify for just to lure you in for that price then let you down it would make it so much easier if they just disclosed all that upfront in an understandable way to break it all down so it would make the process that much less aggravating
919,props to being the first in st louis to serve viet cajun menu could be a little bigger but for what they do have they were all good the place was busy and the service was good
920,i had to make a stop to get one of the staples the hand grenade this drink will get you twisted so be ready in advance i had two and my night was filled with dancing singing laughter and all the makings of an incredible evening in new orleans your drink will last you a while and when you feel like you re finished it seems to be more waiting great place and great staff they were quick getting you in and getting you back out cheers
921,delicious brunch food i absolutely love their biscuits n gravy along with their potato latkes wait is never too bad and they are very quick once you are seated one of my favorite places
922,yummy delicious and more variety than you d expect who says you have to go a fair or amusement park for a funnel cake how about a funnel cake ice cream sandwich beyond sweet 5901 delmar blvd st louis mo 63112 proud sponsor of candice murrell cox and organized khaos keep healing and overcoming struggles thank you beyond sweet for sponsoring candice cox s august 9 2018 1 pm 2 pm appearance how to be mentally well for the school year middle school thank you dallas holland
923,great korean bbq 16 99 all you can eat special from an assortment of meats not chincy with the banchan always offering more sides more lettuce etc a problem in nola is some korean restaurants being stingy with the banchan of course this is not how koreans operate the sides are free flowing and they are here lots of food for the price good assortment and it s fun to cook table side plus the air vents are downward next to the grill so the smoke is minimal wonderful
924,i went for the first time today and really enjoyed my half baked sunday i got the brownie batter warmed up with ice cream and syrup on top and it was really great the amount you get is a lot compared to most ice cream places be sure to sample flavors because they are all great
925,i seriously love this place so fresh so yummy and such a great local business with very friendly staff great prices too i love that they have a lot of healthy options and non sushi options like grilled chicken tofu and shrimp for weird people like my mom who don t like sushi thanks for bringing poke to st louis
926,omg fabulous place for breakfast unbelievable unique menu i am counting calories so the lesser of the evil calories was the belgian waffle with strawberries and fresh whipped cream it was fresh and delicious my friend had the stuffed french toast stuffed with cream cheese and blueberries totally decadent highly recommend
927,i recently took my car to get a quote on replacing the tint on my passenger window the owner was extremely nice and informative on the current quality of my tint and the benefits of sun spot s coverage a lifetime warranty covers the car no matter your location i ended up re tinting all 4 windows and the price was excellent i dropped off my car at 8 and it was ready by 1 30 very professional clean and fair highly recommend
928,i want to like this place i really do it s the only self serve car wash in spring hill that i ve found so far i have never been to a wash that has a dryer that s awesome i like that there s a separate tire wheel brush that has stiff bristles and the regular soft bristled one for washing huge number of settings on the dial bug pre wash waxes rainex and everything takes a card even the vacuums here s where we get to the sticky situation the pricing signage is kinda vague vacuums are 3 but for how long i had to swipe twice so 6 there and couldn t have been more than 15 minutes use on to the wash of which there are only 3 bays for self serve here it s a 5 minimum i swipe and start scrubbing i get a pre wash tires and wheels and half the car soaped up when the machine asks for more money i actually like this feature so i don t spend too much time and money here so second swipe and i m doing great finished soaping up gave the floor mats a little rub with the brush and on to rinse uh oh streaks so now i ve got the brush and rinse sprayer going together spray scrub spray keep moving you ve got to be getting close to times up ok all swirls and streaks gone phew let s rinse and try this fancy hand held dryer and we re done turn to the machine to see the time counting up not down oh crap turn the knob to off and press the button above twice done nope still counting up frantically jab the button several times really hard 18 15 18 16 18 17 i m freakin out a gentleman walks past with a wheeled trash can aha an employee that can help i give chase sir sir mere steps from his ear now sir i m acknowledged yay but i now realize it s way to noisy for his hearing and my voice to make situation clear and articulate it won t stop the timer it won t stop and i motion him to follow me 19 16 19 17 19 18 he comes and pushes the button once and the timer stops phew that s weird but thank you i guess an extra minute isn t too bad how much could that be but strange that it didn t shut off like the first time well 10 15 for a sparkling clean car worth it i d say car hasn t looked this good in months so checking the bank for other things there it is a single 5 authorization for the wash ok no worries checking the bank the next day 31 for a car wash that i did myself and i did a fine job but i certainly wasn t slow about it i m pretty sure i could pay less than that for someone else to do an even better job than i did i think i need to speak to someone hopefully there s somebody even there to speak with i don t think the older gentleman had any authority so we ll see update 3 4 18 jefferey the owner contacted me and was very helpful regarding my experience at the car wash sometimes technology gets the better of us and errors happen glad knowing jefferey is fighting our robot overlords anyway he can
929,a very cool kinda secret place full of books and beer lots of games to play food to order non alcoholic drinks plus the beers great place to just hang out get a t shirt or hat pass the word by wearing their stuff
930,my favorite place to meet friends for breakfast we go there all the time since it opened the staff is wonderful and the food is consistently fantastic they have vegan items added to the menu so now more of my friends can come
931,bailey was a great piercer very friendly and knowledgeable would definitely recommend coming here
932,very cool shop brett did a great job helping me find a gift great selection and very helpful staff thanks so much
933,i got a yelp email and it said that this place has some of the best wings in town so we ventured over and it was true we loved their wings so much pizza was just ok but it s worth going just to get the wings their sauce is soooo yummy the wings are smaller but i like that it weirds me out when wings are these huge unnatural giant things these are the perfect size and flavor go get the three pound portion and share with a friend
934,let me tell you about our amazing event in st petersburg we had a group of 60 people staying at the hollander from the very first conversation i had with vic i could not imagine what a great group of people i was about to have the pleasure of meeting nic vic will are 3 of the kindest most positive people you d ever want to meet every aspect of our event was well taken care of and organized because of the staff at the hollander every staff member is as friendly and welcoming as the next the hotel is absolutely adorable it feels like you re in a movie the large porch invites friendly conversations with folks from all over the pool is just beautiful again the whole vibe of the hotel is getting to know people from all over the world we have stayed in regular queen rooms and we have stayed in a king suite and a double queen suite of course the suites are larger but all the rooms are spotless and extremely comfortable one more thing if you want water asked the folks behind the front desk they have an unending supply
935,friendly service and tasty food fresh seafood perfectly cooked shrimp and they weren t lying about the crawfish being spicy but cool it down with a blended drink from the organic banana stand next door
936,came here for brunch with some friends on sunday because all of the other brunch places in baltimore were booked or had a long waiting time walking in it gives off a homey feels get local it s also a bit cramped not enough where you and your party are on top of each other but you d have to be mindful of moving around or turning and making awkward eye contact our server was nice she didn t check back on us that much until we got our food at which point she d come ever 7 min not complaining we were a little put off by the amount if flies that just seemed to be hovering in the vicinity not sure if thats just common there or someone left the back door open but again off putting food wise i got the chicken and waffles it was suggested to me by a friend it s pretty fricken great the chicken is tender really well seasoned generous portion size and boneless hate looking messy in public places the waffle was underwhelming in that it was soggy 5 min into the meal but really the chicken makes up for it my other friends got the chicken and waffles and the eggs benedict it looked like that at least they were all pretty satisfied especially the friend who got the chicken and waffles curious to see how other breakfast brunch places on baltimore ave compare
937,had a craving for a burger and decided to try this place out since it s close to me and it did not disappoint got the burger of the month and it was delicious along with some cheese fries and a beer everything here looked great and i will definitely be coming back to try more on the menu especially the milkshakes the place itself is a small cute restaurant with an old feel to it and i would imagine its pretty busy on the weekends as there is not a lot of seating highly recommend
938,food was very good only problem is the chef got our orders all mixed up we didn t make an issue just swapped things around my friend too my fries and i took his salad the service was not up to par just year waitress was scarce i ll go back but i felt like we were eating in the middle of a hotel lobby lack of privacy with so many people walking around as they waited for tables
939,the only thing i tried today was the mixed berry bingsu shaved ice you get a cup of it for 4 99 before tax and has a nice layer of snow like ice with a berry sauce and sweet cream swirl it was light refreshing and just the right amount of sweet the bingsu comes in chocolate mango and mixed berry would definitely recommend,came back to try the kimbap it was full of flavour and packed full also a great value you get a lot for the price friendly staff as well
940,outstanding people rolan is an outstanding manager and offers solid wine and cuisine recommendations and treats his clients well the meatballs and the chicken are very aromatic and flavorful and i highly recommend them as well as the sushi as a starter we will be back and this on my short list
941,came here with my brother and a friend on a sunday looking for brunch the gulch was really busy and this was one of the only restaurants that didn t have a crazy insane line we re glad we chose it it was a good choice i had the kentucky thunder spiked milkshake and it was very chocolatey and delicious as for a burger i got the veggie burger with an egg on top it was delicious not as tasty as a real burger but still good and so were the tator tots it was enough food i couldn t even finish everything service was good and the food came out fairly quick
942,i love coming here all of the chiropractors are knowledgeable quick and very kind they gave me a key fob to scan in when i come in i love it because they have an automated system that directs me to the table the reception staff is very helpful and wonderful i recommend this place to anybody looking for a great chiropractic family they have a massage chair that you can sit in while you wait they always have treats while you visit they work with you on payment plans if you can t afford a lump sum
943,my favorite place to grab a drink during my visits to new orleans you will find something that fits your mood on the drink menu but i highly recommend that you request the bar staff to craft something of their choosing i had a la la first off the menu which is the bar s version of a traditional la louisiane but featured local handmade bitters served to me with a side of dark chocolate it was a great way to finish off a cold but fun lundi gras afternoon in the first place but then i didn t want to leave so i asked the bar team to put something together based on that order my second drink was perfect and in fact i probably didn t drink it slowly enough to savor it drink menu aside i think the bar strives to capture that spiritual feeling that stays with you after you leave new orleans between the light sculpture that overtakes the front of the bar to the furnishings to the small touches that nod to the bar s namesakes looking forward to bringing back friends here in the future
944,these guys helped me figure out a solution for fixing a spot in my yard where my dog digs under the fence right around the time the shop was closing i went in thinking i was going to need one thing and they helped me figure out what i really needed which was actually cheaper they also measure my car and loaded it up for me
945,awesome tacos our faves were the carnas carnitas and the taco of the month fried cod with a nice slaw service was a little lacking we had to ask for our drinks beer and wine and never got water best tacos i ve had in a while the guacamole was good a little spicy but good flavor and the chips are awesome black beans and rice looked blah but was full of flavor must be a great local fave there were 6 delivery orders going out while we were there
946,really not sure what the hype was when it opened it s fine the ambiance was nice but the menu is limited and food is nothing to write home about they are in a nice location so at least if you decide to wait then you have things to see,i like the ambiance a lot and for the most part the food is really good huge fan of the whipped feta most important thing to order
947,one of my favorite spots in tampa ambience is beautiful you can definitely see mexican influence all throughout the restaurant food is great drinks are amazing sue is my favorite server she never fails to be great every time i come and visit i typically don t ask for servers but she s someone i will ask for everytime
948,absolutely adore this place we were stopped yesterday by a man giving out samples and went right inside after sampling their amazing product we ended up purchasing white cheddar chipotle oreo explosion and peanut butter blast popcorn the staff was really pleasant and recommended great flavors we will definitely be returning during our next day trip to new hope
949,outstanding food and our server marissa was amazing she took great care of our hockey team we will come back to eat here again
950,first time visiting bob s discount furniture friendly staff mike o was terrific he didn t stalk my boyfriend and i while we shopped he answered our questions and concerns they also have coffee if you need to wake up during your visit
951,i never do reviews but this one deserves a s o they did their thing on my truck someone spilled red wine in my truck and they go it up and made my truck look better than it did when i picked it up
952,friendly neighborhood family business always has the food i need they have a dog area attached to the shop too
953,my mom used to take me here when i was little and i recently started going here again as an adult still exactly how i remember it and that s a good thing a few chinese buffets i ve been to have been a little sketchy and dirty but this one is usually pretty clean for the most part and its always nice and quiet and ive never had to wait for a table the food is always great and if something runs out they are quick to replace with a fresh batch i don t really have any complaints except that the lady that you pay up at the front always seems a little unfriendly lol
954,this is very nice place to go and have a rest i tried their quiche and it was very good our waitress was very nice just i didn t get refile for my coffee she didn t come while we were eating our meal she was nice i think she need to practice lil more this was my first visit and i ll think carefully about visiting this place again
955,greeted with welcome to berlin after a friday rush hour 1 hour drive from tampa at home i lived in west berlin 1977 1982 an extensive draft german and local craft beer selection led to the bernard czech lager highly recommend it i had to try the original berlin street food currywurst with fries and mayo as i had worked at an imbiss in west berlin making this dish also had a bowl of the gulasch soup before departing i ordered several german specialty items and one doener sandwich to go the potato salad and sauerkraut were amazing berlin doener was worth the trip thank you thomas and chef peter wir sehen uns wieder
956,if you re looking for a delicious breakfast created by people who take pride in what they serve you ll like yolklore we re lucky to live in the neighborhood it s clean welcoming and fairly priced though they re known for their egg dishes my personal favorite is the vegan baked oatmeal with either a side of fruit or the potatoes the oatmeal is topped with soy yogurt drizzled with a touch of honey my wife likes the birds nest we never leave without pop tarts for later
957,authentic fast and delicious hard to come by the traditional taste with proper broth and fresh vegetables to compliment the quality of flavor
958,love this place love the ice cream love the cool feel of it love the chalkboard menu just great
959,my favorite place to go in tucson to get tacos no doubt i order flour tacos street style and usually get al pastor or carnitas simple yet so flavorful they also give you free chips which are homemade and kept warm along side the salsa bar where you can put as many kinds as you want on your plate one of my favorite things as i very big on sauces salsas there is usually never an issue finding seating and even if the line is long it moves very quickly they also have a good taco tuesday special making it a very reasonably priced experience overall a must try,went here for my first time yesterday as my boyfriend and i were looking for a place to grab some happy hour items and the reviews were not wrong this place was the bomb we ordered the fried pickles fish tacos and chicken skewers which was the perfect amount of food for the two of us i am not big on fried food but the pickles were so great and not over fried to the point they felt unhealthy the fish tacos were very generous and had a yummy pesto ish sauce on the bottom topped with coleslaw but the chicken skewers may have won the title from me of best i ve ever had it came with 4 but there was so much chicken it looked like it could have been 8 the peanut sauce it was paired with was the perfect touch and the chicken was blackened perfectly will definitely be a regular now because of this appetizer not to mention the happy hour prices were amazing especially for how generous the portions were so happy i tried it out a new favorite spot in my book forsure
960,great food hits the spot when i start missing mom s cooking also it s hard to find banh mi in indy and i love that they have it and make it the way it s supposed to be
961,cozy and comfortable i am here on a very tight budget and this place is worth it thanks for making my stay safe homey and enjoyable definitely this inn is on my favorites list ask for brandy they were the office staff on duty when i checked in they are excellent if you are looking for upscale this is not the place but the great bohemian vibe is comforting it is an old building and doors stick and grout turns dark but this boutique style bed and breakfast is wonderfully modest and quaint
962,this is the best barbecue in the tampa area the meat is all cooked on a smoker right outside the building making the whole place smell amazing it gets a little loud inside as they are chopping the meat to order the menu is mainly sandwiches and dinners dinner meals each come with two sides i had the quarter dark chicken and it was delicious my sides were baked beans and creamy coleslaw my wife had a two meat plate with pulled pork and sausage black eyed peas and green beans on the side both meals came with a slice of white bread we both enjoyed our food and the servings were generous they have a small beer selection as well as dessert but we didn t partake in either the menu and the large chalkboard rave about the mac and cheese but it s only available on fridays so we will be certain to come back for that a decent sized parking lot is easily accessible and a nice feature as parking is very difficult in this part of town
963,great place to eat good variety of entres good environment el personal habla espaol y la comida es muy casera
964,stopped here on our way home from santa barbara really good burgers sandwiches here the sweet potato fries onion rings are to die for also the outdoor seating is really spacious has some ocean views it s in a difficult location with scarce parking though this place is totally worth a stop if you re in the area we will def be coming back
965,great wide trails scenic some elevation view the city from peak trails can be messy days after precipitation
966,good food parking hard to find great for businesses lunch great historic building i had short ribs definitely going to order again
967,i didn t really like my haircut and the prices aren t any more substantially comparable to other places in santa barbara my haircut was a bit uneven choppy and too short on one side compared to the other waiting for it to grow out to go to my usual person but went here to give it a shot the lady who cut my hair is very nice and sociable she seems to do good haircuts on other people but i think mine just didn t turn out the way i wanted to oh well
968,i went in on a lark while staying in boise and had prime rib and a croissant bread pudding price to quality it beats the more trafficked chandler s the steak was perfectly done and the presentation of such a staple item was flawless my server charged my iphone for me when it ran down and made sure there was nothing i needed the ambiance is more fitted for date night than a random traveler like me though so expect that it will be quiet and not have much in the way of bar conversation
969,an adorable little produce place with some of the freshest best produce do yourself a favor and stop by
970,very friendly staff and my fajitas were excellent good quality meats the inside decor was nice the only thing was they only gave me 2 tortillas for my fajitas usually mexican restaurants give you at least 3 i had to ask for more but they were nice about it
971,only tried the hip city ranch chicken sandwich and fries but wow were they delicious sandwich was on point could ve been a tiny bit crispier in my opinion but the taste and portion was excellent will definitely be visiting again only downside is that the space is tiny and you most likely will not find a seat if you go on the weekend between 12 5 pm
972,this ain t dora the explorer i m talking about some real mexican cuisine so if you re feeling scared go back to taco bell large portions at small prices with friendly staff and quick service this is an excellent spot to chow down on some food from our neighbors to the south stop on by you ll be glad you did
973,not your run of the mill chinese restaurant fresh house made noodles and unique dishes make this place different in a good way the potstickers were awesome as was the chef s sauce noodles and the kung fu beef noodle soup there were lots of other interesting dishes being brought to neighboring tables that looked equally tempting stop in for a nice change of pace from the ordinary
974,web site was easy to use to place our order we are from out of town and found them on yelp our order was delivered in half the time what they indicated and the pizza tasted great
975,visited here a couple times while on vacation in new orleans the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was very chill and comfortable had the pain perdu and the coconut ginger soup which were both quite good good for a quick bite breakfast or some early morning coffee great place to start the day especially while on vacation
976,this food place is near my work and the fellow employees frequent there amazing food and wonderful people their burgers are among the best i ve ever eaten and the prices are fairly reasonable
977,you have to try the southern melt it was probably the best sandwich i ve ever had the black bean soup was really good as well service was fast and friendly location is in downtown reno it s a small spot but cozy and inviting
978,the best everything purchased the german chocolate cake fresh pasta alfredo sauce and shrimp wish the store the wasn t so crowded but it s that good you tolerate the closeness of your fellow shoppers
979,vinny tony lindsay anne mark in fact everyone at heavenly nails do excellent work and everyone makes you feel special great people who do a fabulous job i would not go anywhere else thank you

981,enjoyed a nice sunday brunch with a tall caramel latte jalapeno cheddar bacon grits where on point
982,very happy with chez bow wow i have an older jack russell terrier and he s never looked forward to going to groomers or vets but he actually gets excited and happy when he walks into the shop i like what they do for him he always looks good coming out i also sometimes get him the micro bubble treatment which i get to help with his skin allergies fair warning that isn t cheap but it s worth it to see his discomfort reduced as an added bonus they are happy to watch your pup for a bit if you are out running errands i don t think they walk the dogs so don t leave them there forever but i am glad to know my dog is in a safe place
983,staff was extremely friendly especially our waiter i ordered the traditional with potatoes and my friend had ordered the lucy omelette big portions everything was delicious would recommend this place for breakfast also mimosas were delight too
984,the food is absolutely great do not hesitate at first we ordered only a plate to get to know how it would be but ended up ordering twice as much after tasting the shrimp pasta is amazing
985,you can t go wrong with any of the juices i love the french toast and the shrimp and grits i think the pancake has too much baking soda which gives it a weird taste but i can live without it cute cozy restaurant worth the usual wait
986,this is a very cute trendy bar located in a new tampa area i m just visiting my friend in tampa for her birthday and she decided to do brunch here we had a yummy flat bread egg brunch and some delicious drinks it s right by the water and it s a great location to be with friends for a sunday funday
987,i m a big beef noodle soup lover the soup base at hakka is authentic if you are looking for the best beef noodle soup in philly hakka is a must try side dishes are great and they are great matches for the beef noodle soup highly recommend
988,cant say how much i love shopping here staff are always very nice and the prices are always great too my son even loves to go shopping here with me although its mostly because the treats he gets while were there,very good always very clean staff are always polite the food is pretty average and tends to be a little bland but i think thats they re way of trying to be kid friendly
989,another wonderful dinner at the boiling house i m so in love with their food thank you ms courtney for your service so kind polite sweet for checking in on yelp i received a coupon for one free lemonade we had already ordered and drinks came with our meal but courtney had no problem with my request to take my free lemonade to go i just wish their establishment was larger because on busy nights it s hard to get in and i don t always like having dinner at 5 p m on thursday but that s the best time to get a seat
990,the pizza was excellent great staff and you can eat al fresco try the pizza blanca then go next door coolside for gelato,great greek food and a greek bakery next door makes hellas a must stop in charming tarpon springs the history of sponge diving and how greeks came to this area is something you will appreciate try the large gyros and top it off at hellas delicious greek bakery deserts

995,stayed here for a turn around business trip we got in early and they were able to get our room ready by 11am so we didn t have to wait till the 3pm check in that was much appreciated they also have coffee through out the day and with my member level i could just grab my two waters from the case the room was very clean and also newly renovated the bed was comfortable and i appreciate that the pillows actually had form to them and didn t flatten paper thin once you laid on them i didn t use the indoor pool or outdoor hot tub but the appeared clean and inviting the gym is a tad small but has a full weight rack which is awesome they also have treadmills an elliptical and a stationary bike they also have a free shuttle to and from the airport and takes about five minutes to travel between the two the continents breakfast was pretty solid with eggs and potatoes being served out of cast iron le creuset pots with lids on top of an electric range to keep things warm i look forward to staying here the next time i am in town for business
996,traveling this summer with another baseball mom who is vegan expanded my palate and now my go to yelp search when i m somewhere new is vegetarian which has allowed me to find wonderful restaurants like this one the menu was expansive with arancini tacos empanadas sandwiches salads and ramen and it was very hard to make a decision especially since i was solo and wouldn t have the opportunity to order some small plates to share and taste someone else s dinner choice i decided on the velvet rojo butternut squash corn grilled avocado edamame succotash portobello skewers it was as beautiful as it was delicious and the portion was generous i took half home and can t wait to enjoy it for lunch today
997,i have spent thousands of dollars for materials at hd renovating houses but try to use your credit card on file to rent something and they treat you like a thief can t rent over the phone and have someone pick it up cost you time and money
998,this is my favorite restaurant in all of tampa bay this place is just out of this world the service the food the ambiance could all compete with any award winning restaurant in a major city they often have groupons for their amazing 6 course tasting menu a must
999,this review starts with los arroyos and us jonesing for good mexican we stopped in los arroyos only to discover that the chips were stale the salsa bland and the queso scorched so we ventured next door for a little italian at convivio i wasn t in the mood for italian so feel like i was a hard sell and yet so pleased by everything love the started focaccia love the pizza the meatballs were amazing this place is devine thank you los arroyos for being dismal so i could find convivio will definitely be back

1001,there is genius within a place like this all hail the family run local strip mall joint okay so maybe that intro was a little too extra but mizu was simply perfect quiet competent service outstandingly presented super fresh sushi pleasantly elegant decor generous portions flawless tempura clean and well appointed bathrooms we can t wait to come back thank you mizu asian bistro
1002,our waitress was very nice and always check on us periodically and fulfill our request pleasantly the price is little bit pricey i ordered new orlean salmon and it came with 2 sides and salad so it s plenty their lobster punch drink is also delicious my kids enjoyed watching the lobster tank in the front though
1003,great customer service i called and was taken care of within the same day this is probably the easiest time i have had dealing with a service provider would definitely recommend
1004,although it was crazy busy brunch time saturday morning the food was fantastic we tried the monte cristo and were not disappointed the bread was rich cheese creamy jam delicious and ham perfectly cooked we also tried the dark chocolate strawberry danish which was awesome and highly recommended
1005,if you like hearty diner food this is the place to go they have large portions pretty much any breakfast food you want and absolutely delicious cinnamon buns i had the 2 eyed toad in the hole sandwich more complicated than it sounds it s basically a sourdough sandwich with cheese tomato bacon and an over easy egg it was a decent sandwich but the star was easily the home fries they were whole potatoes and oh so crispy decent prices too check them out if you re looking for a homestyle breakfast or lunch
1006,been coming here since the place open and i swear it s gotten better and better every single time we live pretty close by and we re super happy in this place opened up their weekend specials and brunch are pretty amazing some of the freshest fish in the city 100 hands down

1009,we had the back and bleu salad it was awesome would definitely come back again great service too
1010,we are family of newer and used cars with four vehicles among us finding a reliable and trustworthy mechanic these days is nothing short of impossible but we have found such a person wensel s auto is the first mechanic we have dealt with in the past 14 years that completely puts us at ease and we have the comfort of knowing we are getting accurate information and excellent job and the best prices to boot if you are searching for a mechanic in the area search no more

1019,i first ate here actually several years ago while attending an american college of physicians acp conference while in med school and me and several friends were very impressed with the hole in the wallness of this place and i m pleased to see upon returning that it really hasn t changed that much same location doors opened so that the delicious smells from the kitchen can quickly grab your attention and draw you gingerly in to partake of all the goodness they have to offer i ordered the pulled pork sandwich and really really really wanted the jambalaya but they happened to be all out so i had to settle for the fries instead they are known for their bacon cheddar beignets but i didn t get a chance to sample those i will tell you that everything i ate was so delicious they are close to morial conference center and there is some on the street parking available you can even dine outside and enjoy the sites and sounds that this district of n awlins has to offer thanks for a terrific late afternoon lunch visiting this restaurant again brought back found memories of my med school days with classmates who are now lifelong friends and colleagues bravo
1020,decent food at a good price but nothing to write home about lol the two people in there i m assuming husband and wife possibly the owners were very attentive and eager to help they were happy to make recommendations and help us pick out our orders i had the pad thai and a cup of the tom yum soup i ordered the pad thai 5 in the 0 5 heat scale so it was spicy but seemed to lack some of the flavors of a standard pad thai and the tom yum wasn t tangy like it typically is but the service was great and the price was fair so i ll likely be back
1021,we ve been looking for our go to sushi spot in reno for years and we just found it sushi is fresh delicious and unique the service was over the top amazing our server john made the perfect sushi recommendations for our taste and left us feeling full and satisfied ambiance is chic loungey cool vibes we will definitely be back for more
1022,i brought my family here whenever they came into town and they absolutely loved it we got the wings and ramen noodle bowl i can still taste that delicious meal i will be going back very soon because it was that good friendly staff and informative
1023,on a venture to visit all 50 state capitals i was happy to visit biscuit love as one of my brunch spots in nashville despite the freezing weather the restaurant was still well populated as recommended my table got the bonuts to share they were warm fluffy and dense at the same time but not too sweet for my dish i got the east nasty the biscuit was fine but the highlight was the crust on the fried chicken it was airy not oily i put the sausage gravy on the side because i m not a personal big fan sausage gravy in general but it was good if you are a fan of biscuits and gravy mini perk at the complimentary water station they have sparkling and flat water so cool overall if i ever come back i wouldn t mind stopping in again
1024,their verde pizza is one of the best pizzas i have ever eaten ricotta almonds and abs amazing pesto
1025,i never thought i d needed to write this review about puckett s in franklin but something needs to be said over the last four months or so some subtle changes have been going on first and most important is the music this is a place we would go for dinner on friday and saturday twice a month on average i always looked forward to look at next months schedule to see what bands were playing i m a classic rock guy and there was never a shortage of bands of this type we haven t been to puckett s for dinner on the weekend since the first of the year the bands we enjoyed are no longer playing and it s always seems to be somebody and their friends the list is pretty long i have the feeling that they are cutting costs and the music lineup seems to be suffering from this the food is pretty much the same and is very good the latest change is the happy hour changes not a big deal overall but the next cost cutting move we ve been coming here for years and have always recommended it to all our friends why you would take a top notch successful way of doing business and start making changes to save some money is beyond me don t forget your roots and who you are you seem to be getting bigger and are starting to lose your way
1026,yum amazing greek good my husband and i usually split the combination platter so we can have a small sample of all of our favorites the greek shrimp are amazing too there are a lot of great choices in tarpon but this is a consistent favorite
1027,as i told the chef julie buhler this is the best f king sandwich i ve had in a long time by sandwich i mean the stoner which inckudes steak lettuce tomato goat cheese saracha and ranch dressing on a hoagie roll fresh savory with that bite of saracha that grabs you enough to gain your attention the menu is small but serve both breakfast lunch and dinner that has enough choices for vegetarians and meat lovers alike affordable fresh and definitely not the norm and friends that is a good thing it is an old garage transformed with artsy decor and minimal flash so my friends if you want something that is definitely not the norm but worth a try get there soon you will not be sorry https www phatbites com menus
1028,you must go do goat yoga such a fun time the best customer service and staff baby goats are good for the s
1029,there is much buzz about the children s museum and i will say that it is a valuable asset to indianapolis this is probably one of the most accommodating museums i have seen with ramps for strollers they layout is impeccable nice open airy spaces wide easy to use halls the workers seem well treated and eager to help yet they aren t in your face pushy like other museums when i rate museums though one measure that i include in my ratings is the accessibility to the community and like other museums in indianapolis the children s museum needs to improve for people who are of lower socioeconomic levels many museums are able to improve socioeconomic accessibility by shifting their admission charge to parking costs this would make the museum more affordable to people who rely on public transportation and incentivize environmentalism given that large sections of marion county have fallen under harsh times the children s museum can truly innovate by extending its services to cater more to lower income communities quite frankly even the 245 family membership can be steep for even middle income families they should at least allow for reciprocity agreements in that level of membership issues in pricing aside as children s museum the indianapolis children s museum is among the best in the country it is one of those rare museums that possesses something to interest every child the bodily kinesthetic learner can enjoy the toddler play zone on the 3rd floor or the extensive sports park outside my 16 month old loves the dinosaur exhibit i found that the history exhibit does a good job of explaining racial inequality and injustice in the world and is quite interactive for children of all ages the china exhibit exposes children to multiculturalism quite often many children s and science museums have too much learn or too much play and not enough learning and the indianapolis children s museum has done a nice job of balancing both i think the children s museum was smart in their expansion efforts to build off of what they have rather than build completely new this is a smart strategy because it doesn t alienate past clientele who flocked to different exhibits an example of public private collaboration that should be happening more in indianapolis is the presence of a public library within the museum through this my 16 month old can take home a bag of free books with her that she can return the next time she visits overall the children s museum provides a magical experience for the children that it serves it does not get my most elite rating however because its pricing structure keeps certain groups out this seems to be an unfortunate trend with museums across indy and there is room for the children s museum to reverse this trend and expand its hard but good work of educating children
1030,a perennial favorite that any visitor to stl should place on their do not miss list we go to ted drewes several times a year and have never been disapppointed this is the best frozen custard in the state and maybe the country although it may seem boring the basic hot fudge sundae is my favorite my wife and daughter are turtles all the way i would say no matter what you order you will love it don t miss it and make the extra drive if you want the most delicious creamy treat
1031,absolutely loved this place quaint welcoming feel to it colorful wall murals and friendly staff were nice complements to the delicious food i love shrimp and grits so i ordered their bbq shrimp and grits which was delicious and generous enough size since grits are heavier there re plenty of yummy options on the menu which made decision making difficult their moscow mule was good as was the bloody mary my friend had the crab cake benedict with which he was very happy would come back to this place for sure expect a wait but if you are patient you won t regret it
1032,this venue is incredible the staff here treats you like family and work hard to make any requests a reality breanna was always willing to talk on the phone or via email she was so wonderful in helping execute my wedding vision the mansion was a perfect backdrop for a romantic and intimate wedding without feeling cramped the food was next level i was blown away by how amazing the food was it was not the typical wedding food i really felt like we went to a high end restaurant the staff was exceptional they were visibly invisible and made sure all the guests were happy and satisfied this venue is remarkable it is historic scenic and romantic i cannot stress enough how grateful i am to have had my wedding here it made for an unforgettable evening
1033,i ordered the tiramisu cake for a friend s bday because he loves tiramisu these cakes are good if you like buttercream icing but if not i would try something else i m not a fan of buttercream and the cake had so much on it that we had to scrape off an entire plate s worth eager to try their other desserts the inside of the shop is like a dream though so adorable and gorgeous
1034,found this place on yelp and decided to try it out since i was visiting from california for a couple days i don t think it deserves 4 5 stars the food was ok the fried pickles were delicious but their signature bacon fried corn bread that they mentioned being on the food network for i didn t not think was good we left almost the entire thing untouched it was super greasy and tasted like oil butter and maple my husband got a roast pork sandwich which was decent i got brussels sprouts and a brocollini bruschetta and my mom got the seafood risotto and a barbacoa on polenta nothing was bad it was all ok but nothing spectacular and almost all the dishes were super drenched in oil especially the brussels sprouts and risotto
1035,good pancakes but they re just that pancakes in my opinion it doesn t justify the wait it does go relatively quickly i had the country ham i think more than anything its just not for me really salty but i think its supposed to be that way my review isnt influenced by that alone if you want to check it out as a tourist spot by all means go you ll enjoy your pancakes but i m not in a rush to wait so long for an averahe breakfast when there s so many amazing options around
1036,came here for the first time last week excellent food for a brewery my vegetarian friend was completely satisfied with the menu options great beer too i ve had the blonde many times i ve visited arizona my only small gripe is the lack of beer descriptions anywhere no printed list and the chalkboard tap list doesn t elaborate the bar was slammed and it would ve been nice to try something new without having to slow service down for everyone by asking what exactly is a ncaale when it could ve just been written down somewhere that said great place overall and i d definitely return
1037,not enough granola on a 11 aa bowl i asked for more and only got a small sprinkle that s all that was missing a crunch it was basically a smoothie you spooned i ll go back to try some toast but not for a bowl
1038,oh first off it smells delicious secondly it tastes delicious we didn t know that our order of chicken came with a donut so we had ordered donuts too which we ended up not being disappointed about they probably didn t tell us that they came with donuts because they just thought we wanted more who knows i ordered sweet garlic wings the hubs ordered the combo of buttermilk ranch and we shared in order to try different flavors they were both scrumptious but i preferred my sweet garlic and the donut that came with it was so juicy which sounds weird but then later someone outside of the restaurant had told us it was a honey donut which made sense we also ordered the guava donut forgot what it was called though and that too despite sounding weird was really yummy anyway gave it 4 stars for now cos it was my first time and it was good it ll have to wait for my return in an estimated year or so to get bumped up to a 5
1039,food was pretty good i had the eggplant lasagna and curry veggies i thought it might have been a little pricey considering it s not made to order and more like cafeteria style served i paid almost 9 for the two parking kinda bad but i will be going back
1040,one of my all time favorite hangouts what s not to love about cst the history the environment the drinks the tri tip sandwich the music and the full sit down restaurant whatever mood i m in cst has a solution for me
1041,we ve eaten at sabrina s four times now and it still gets 5 stars for food and service sabrina is delightful and comes out of the kitchen when she can to spend time with her customers cannot recommend this restaurant enough the tacos are fabulous as is the cuban sandwich
1042,i order custom salad from this location about 2 3 times a week and they do a great job every time i have ordered their pizzas and i love the pepperoni simple but always delicious
1043,the food and drinks are awesome definitely ask for andy when you visit best place in south tampa
1044,very nice and fresh food atmosphere is nice real clean tables chargrilled oyster were ok chicken hibachi was real good the crawfish rolls were the bomb love them what top it the most was the service quick and prompt food didn t take long at all
1045,always a good choice for a impromptu night out as well as date night there is a great variety of choices and you can never go wrong with a burger from here i really really like their a2 sauce especially with my fries variety of beers as well as a full bar and there is always a terrific special not a really fancy place but a little more upscale casual comfortable and friendly service their iced tea is good as well dessert we always have the lemon meringue delicious we hear their rotisserie meat is terrific and what they are known for but we always get distracted from trying it by one of the other yummy choices some day soon though we re going to have to try it reasonable price for the great quality
1046,my brother loves him some waffle house so while he visited indy i dragged myself there i ordered the chocolate chip waffle with hashbrows i liked how there was a variety of options for each dish so you can have your hashbrows waffles and eggs multiple ways my brother had the texas sausage melt and had his hashbrows peppered with jalapeos of course he loved his breakfast besides the stained cups not too had of a place i also wish they would have included the onions in the hashbrows versus layered underneath them
1047,shrimp and grits best food i have ever had in my life lydia is wonderful wow my wife had the migras breakfast and loved it my son had the biscuits and gravy and my daughter hand the scramble eggs with lox all great to get here from french quarter we took the st charles tram to garden district then short work
1048,well if this isn t the most over rated place ever i don t know what is it almost makes me want to open a restaurant just to watch everyone flock to it and take their money and shut down just as the fad dies and i don t mean years later when i start cutting corners and offering smaller portions and jacking prices while the service swan dives no i m talking about the minute a line 30 people deep waiting for ok food vanishes don t get me wrong this restaurant is just fine if you want mediocre brothy soup embellished with garlic or spice decorated with half a hard boiled egg is this really the trend it must be because people line up to stand outside on speedway next door to may s chicken and waffles i can t understand this given the choice between waiting for 25 minutes for soup vs no wait for chicken waffles burgers i m going next door from now on small restaurant no outside seating very reminiscent of sweets raku in vegas long lines for costco desserts food ok tried the vegetarian and pork ramen as well as the miso tasty not worth 12 not worth 30 minute wait for the love of the yelp god go eat some pho easily twice as filling about 3 less expensive and no 30 minute wait
1049,just went during lunch on a friday not very busy and service was slow the gal who waited on me was not friendly at all however the food was good the omelet was very bland but the greens sweet potato wedges and cookie had a lot of flavor the atmosphere was swanky and cool minus the old school ceiling that aside i will be back to try something else on the menu and hope for friendlier service
1050,authentic thai cuisine family owned and run dish s were fresh and very tasty level of spice hotness from mild to wild
1051,first time here and loved it plenty of food great service and free soup food was delicious
1052,excellent food excellent dining experience atmosphere is relaxed place is very nice and clean staff was attentive nice and explained menu items well started with complimentary pita bread which was freshly made and warm hummus and dolmeh appetizers were great entree was the persian room special which consisted of barg filet mignon chicken filet koobideh kabob and basmati rice for 41 you get a huge platter that easily serves 2 3 people all of the meat was seasoned well and very very tender the filet was my favorite not a cheap meal but well worth the money this is a great addition to tucson no matter what part of town you live in you should definitely check this place out
1053,wow impressed super yummy food with huge portions homemade tater tots and great pickles pulled pork has a thicker smoke flavor but good grits had great texture well made everything was fantastic come with a huge appetite i ate maybe 1 3 of my lunch but couldn t take it as we are bar hopping i told the server i cut it in 1 2 and to eat it lol very cool establishment great music
1054,a warm smile greeted me from the lady running the shop she helped me find all of the items i needed quaint shop with a nice atmosphere great quality and a variety of choices but was limited to smaller quantities of each item very helpful for recommending quality items and giving to you at a fantastic price i just discovered it however i will gladly make the drive 30 minutes to get there again for their service quality of products now that the store near old hickory nolensville pike get some mochi and pocky
1055,food is great drinks are great deals are great brunch with 2 4 1 drinks heck yeah the menu is extensive and interesting with unique twists on classic dishes the service is also great but i am withholding a fifth star due to the management s seating policies we came for brunch on a sunday expecting an hour plus wait so when the hostess informed us it would be 1hr45m we weren t surprised however we became frustrated when we noticed there were 4 open tables on the patio that still hadn t been seated after an hour of waiting it was a beautiful day so we asked the hostess about it and she said that the tables were reserved when we asked again she explained that the patio tables were not assigned to a specific server but were instead added on to a server s load inside so they weren t seating them because they didn t want to overwhelm the servers totally understandable to not want to overwork your servers but why not seat people with the caveat that service will be slower or better yet why not specifically assign a server to the outdoor section so that wait times will be lower having worked in the service industry our group was confused by this we ended up just sitting at one of the empty patio tables until the hostess notified us that a table was ready we ordered the cheddar biscuit the wood fire double yokes and a turkey feta omelette from the specials board and all were delicious the biscuit comes in a trio and though it doesn t look like a lot of food they are very filling our server surprised us with a side of white trash hash on the house because our food was taking longer than expected we didn t even notice the timing so it was a very nice gesture the white trash hash is a must this stuff is addicting potatoes rice and gooey cheese who could ask for more overall great place for brunch in nashville expect a long line but food worth the wait hopefully management can improve their seating policies to cut down on wait times in the future
1056,when with some local friends for dinner and drinks and it was a cool place definitely very trendy with the old warehouse feel and wood and industrial vibe they brew there own beers as the name suggests i had the copperhead pale ale which was very good i had the reuben and it was great lots of meat piled high also had the beer battered fried and they were awesome highly recommend the fries others had bacon cheeseburgers and they enjoyed them good place to meet friends for food and drinks
1057,always a winner this place is located right next to the old no 77 hotel and is always crowded so make reservations ahead of time i was hoping for new items on the menu since my last visit but maybe next time we ordered appetizers crispy pig ears smoked aioli 5 these are always a crowd pleaser the rub was very flavorful but i prefer thinner slices for more crispiness dirty rice arancini sour orange mojo 5 the hint of orange definitely gave an tasty twist to your normal cajun rice entrees hamachi guava curry papaya 15 sadly i didn t love this dish the hamachi itself was a bit fishy and i couldn t get pass the taste in order to taste the other flavors also this has a bit of an unexpected level of spicy caribbean seafood pepper pot 21 i loved this one it was the best dish of the night it s a very light creamy broth that just balances perfectly with the artichoke and seafood trio of pork apples celery root 31 beautiful presentation great spices in the pork the mixture of sweet of the apples paired nicely with the three types of pork sides semolina gnocchi collard green creole spices 8 this was very interesting i would describe it was southern mac and cheese it was super creamy and cheesy with more salt then i would ve liked next time i would stick to the caribbean seafood pepper pot i would say this a great experience if you re looking for for french cajun style
1058,the hotel is absolutely beautiful there are several restaurants shops and a bar located inside as well there is a garden atrium and small waterfalls and rivers with shrubbery and flowers around the mall is right next door also the hotel is very big and you can easily get lost here that is a downside but if you stay a while you get to know your way around
1059,really relaxed vibe a lot of food for the price and made to order nice spot for good fresh food
1060,me and my boyfriends favorite place never disappointed gnocchi is to die for you definitely get what you paid for
1061,i get the same three dishes and some every time i am here amazing service amazing food the calamari is cooked to the tea you have to try everything at least once on the menu khmer kitchen doesn t disappoint
1062,i love gus s food it is the best you will ever eat from a food truck but i must admit with him no longer serving the falafel s it does take a little something away from the overall dish he made the best falafel s i ve ever tasted i sure hope he will reconsider adding them back to the menu i m also not buying the story of the machine being broke i believe he stopped serving the falafel s based off of someone s review which i totally believe was not true saying they had hair in it i ve been eating off this truck for 18 years and never had a problem gus please bring back the falafel s
1063,it s good and consistent but not the best pho i have had make sure to ask a lot of questions
1064,really enjoyed the food i had the hot chicken sandwich hot in side i m glad cause it was super hot we also ordered mac and cheese fried pickle brisket okra all were very good the staff was helpful with answering questions there is limited areas to eat but you can take to river and enjoy there if no seating
1065,my favorite drinks place to imbibe before a show in ybor kyle is spot on every time with what is seemingly the exact thing i want before i even know it also the nachos trust me
1066,i drive up from california to have dan do my tattoos he gives you exactly what your looking for and the rest of the artists there make you feel welcome and at home i would highly recommend making an appointment here if you re looking to get some ink done
1067,nice and modern ambiance the food is a touch extra but still really good just maybe not the best for picky eaters the queso with chorizo is a must try
1068,we have been wanting to try delicia for sunday brunch for a while now and finally got around to it the biggest surprise was that the brunch items were reasonably priced for the quality of the offerings the food was delicious just like their dinner offerings and most offerings are unique items not found at other brunch places service was very good we will most definitely be back soon
1069,we enjoyed a drink up on the balcony before our 6 15pm reservation which was a great introduction the balcony was surprisingly empty which lent to a peaceful relaxing experience really lovely table setting and presentation everyone really enjoyed their meals corn chowder soup of the day with andouille and bacon was really good herb chicken pork chop both very tasty the servers gave excellent recommendations and were very attentive even with it being quite busy overall it was a really nice experience which was a pleasant surprise for a touristy location
1070,the bar overall is nice nice facade very large interior and a big patio they have a solid beer selection and all of their drinks are reasonably priced 3 bud light pints 4 wells and the bartenders are personable the food selection is fantastic and the prices are cheap considering what is offered they have a bunch of games all around the bar including really nice soft and steel tip dart boards and a pool table the pool table unfortunately is the only drawback to this bar there is only one table and it s in shoddy condition and it costs 10 hour aside from the pool price table condition this bar is a 5 star if they were to replace the table with a coin operated version it would be that being said i would have gladly paid a slightly higher price for the drinks or the food at least and had free pool
1071,execellent bakery we had cold coffee fruit tarte napoleon and rasin roll all were fanatasitic kind employer is another plus
1072,came here on a saturday for the 12 00pm tour so many people they had to split into two separate groups the tour was about 45 minutes includes walking up and down stairs the brewery was not running on the day of our tour but nice to see the production areas chemistry lab and 50 acre campus it s a totally free tour and includes a sample of any of their 4 or 5 beers on tap tips accepted so bring cash also no flip flops allowed very close to usf mosi and busch gardens
1073,this restaurant had an elegant yet classic feel to it sitting right on the edge of city park the weeping willow views offered some of my favorite while visiting the city located a bit outside of downtown the trolly could offer as a beneficial transportation and also be a very fun journey to dinner nothing fell short through this meal from the greeting to the service and of course the tastiness of the food nicole was our server she was extremely pleasant and had an almost historical knowledge of food items and city culture alike felt as though my family and i had a personal tour guide who loved answering questions from the braised lamb toast to the turtle soup garlic cheese bread chicken and andouille gumbo the starters blew our socks off the cocktail i tried was a mysterious twist on champagne with a dose of absinthe called death in the oaks and was a wonderful supplement to the mystique surrounding the vibe of the restaurant of the two steaks i tried i would have to say i would prefer the strip steak over the bacon filet both we tasty but the flavor that came alongside with the blue cheese on the strip was to die for i also could have had a sauce to compliment the steak fry wedges that came with filet i found myself getting bored with the plainness of potato and found myself wanting something to compliment them tried my sister s pork chop amazing the plate that stole the night for me was my mom s bbq shrimp holy lord make sure you request extra bead so you can soak up every last drop of the sauce that comes with the bbq deliciousness i wasn t much in the mood for deserts but we did try the passion fruit cheesecake flourless chocolate cake and another chocolate dish that started with a b that i cannot remember for the life of me sold a for this experience i would recommend and i would most definitely return for another meal
1074,i absolutely love this office all around great place dr freytag is so nice and amazing i get my braces off in two months and my teeth look so much better whenever i need to be seen even if it s a last minute emergency they fit me in i would recommend this office to anyone chelsea is also amazing when i thought my braces were too tight and something was wrong she saw me no questions asked and took the time to check when they were about to close for the day this office has gone above and beyond for me and exceeded my expectations 10 10 would recommend
1075,fantastic company to work with would love to host another event in the sb area so i can call them again darin sierra and kathleen were amazing throughout the entire process from booking to day of the event they really made everything so easy and were quick to offer help and suggestions when needed and cindy our driver was terrific we had about twenty kids on the bus and they all had a great time she was professional friendly attentive and a good driver to boot
1076,the best boba in town i made my co workers addicted to boba and they said nothing compares could you please open a new one on the east side we would love it
1077,the food was fantastic hot obviously right out of the oven on a room temperature plate i ll definitely return i knocked them down 1 star because the ac was struggling so it was too warm and the service was slow even though they weren t busy you can get a 25 gift certificate for here on restaurant com for i think it s 4
1078,great customer service food is so fresh the ranch is amazing the new sliced pickles are great super fast as well very clean overall a great experience
1079,pretentious and overpriced for a menu with 4 entres you don t even get some bread and butter to munch on while you wait and talk but hey they get you for the location so why waste on bread and olive oil having said that the quality of the food is right but if you re a foodie there s nothing new and exciting here like the japanese proverb says you climb mount fuji once and you are a wise man you climb mount fuji twice and you are a fool i won t be a fool
1080,service was good the parmesan chicken was tender and fried to perfection wasn t too oily or greasy either the bar tenders and gm were a pleasure to visit with we popped in just to get out of the sprinkle of a saturday afternoon shower and turned out to be a great experience
1081,they were pretty busy when we came in but we had a reservation and were seated directly it took a little while to get drinks ordered and on the table but once they were there the juice was great and the coffee was decent we all ordered waters along with our other beverage of choice but we were almost finished with our meal by the time we got them the food all tasted great but i could tell some of the food sat while the other food was being finished i had a scrambled egg dish that was warm on the inside but my wife s eggs benedict was piping hot we split nutella crepes with banana and strawberries delicious my mouth is watering thinking about it i look forward to coming back again just not during a peak time
1082,i was prompted to check in as soon as i entered the door the receptionist was very kind and after waiting only a few min with one person ahead of me i was asked to be seen by a technician while waiting one lady worker came up to my children and gave them stickers she even came around while my blood was being drawn and helped entertained them she was so nice another technician over heard that chocolate had gotten over my stroller and came in with a handy alcohol pad to help my little girl clean up the mess nice people everywhere with the most efficient process my best renown lab experience yet it doesn t hurt that it s next door to a chocolate shop and petsmart and in the same plaza as baskin robbins and l l bbq i was able to take care of so many errands without lugging my kids in and out of the car so much
1083,we used watson adventures for a bridal shower and had a great experience we had about 18 hunters and everyone had a blast we arranged for them to come out to us in conshocken they set up the hunt there and the theme was our bride nancy was our guide and she was amazing and had so much patience with our large group we would definitely use them again
1084,i had a great experience at golden nails tammy was awesome i walked in around 11 20 on a thursday and was able to be helped right away the basic pedicure was wonderful i enjoyed light conversation with tammy which was nice because i came alone the salon was clean and staff was friendly i got a french manicure on my nails and it looks great i did not feel rushed or pressured at all in fact i felt very relaxed i m very pleased
1085,great place to get out of the new orleans heat great cold drinks yummy appetizers and tasty po boys
1086,love the yum yum club and macaroni salad is awesome too sometimes service could be a little more friendly but besides that i continue to go back because price is right and good tastes great
1087,we ve just had dinner at eatalia for the 2nd time in the last 3 months and each time our meal has been delicious the quality and consistency of the cooking and the creative daily specials really makes this place a true find in my opinion just a few minutes off i 95 it s easier to get here than to most restaurants in center city or south philly and the free street parking couldn t be any easier overall this is a comfortable reasonably priced unassuming neighborhood byob which has become one of my new favorites
1088,my fianc and i use to go here for dates when we started dating we went back tonight and saw they expanded their menu their zha jing mein is delicious now they have limited time items like miso ramen their miso ramen is amazing it was the closet ramen compared to japan ramen here in reno
1089,great place to buy phone cases good selection and good prices they also fix phones as well
1090,currently staying at this hotel for the cbi conference nice hotel located in center city the rooms are very spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable be prepared to pay for parking which is common in this area however the parking garage for this hotel is slightly deceiving as the sign says public parking and then when you pull in it says no credit cards accepted however once you receive your ticket you take it to the check in counter and they bill the parking to your room the conference rooms in which the event is being held in are standard but well kept and the food provided was quite good although the salmon was overcooked overall a good hotel to stay at if you re in the center city area,ok so this was my first vegan meal and it did not disappoint i ordered the chipotle chicken wrap with cabbage and sweet potato fries with siraracha aioli which was delicious the location itself is a quaint spot located in university city and the staff was very pleasant they had delicious looking desserts which i did not partake in but i look forward to to trying some my next time back
1091,my first visit to reeds last night greeted seated as soon as we entered service was professional and friendly i ordered the brussels and the braised beef cheeks both were amazing my friend had the cheese burger which she enjoyed i will definitely return to try some of the other things on the menu they paid attention to detail flavor quality,interesting little place tucked off of main service was friendly and professional food was nice
1092,over the top jaw dropping best food of your life my sister my best friend and i all have birthdays within one week so we decided to come here for a birthday lunch the menu was a little pricey so we all ordered appetizers for ourselves as a meal and each one was insanely delicious duck springrolls garlic truffle fries gumbo yaya and the amazing mushroom dish that i don t think they have anymore when we told the waiter super sweet guy that we were there for our birthdays he brought each of us a complimentary birthday bread pudding which was also ridiculously good we all couldn t stop talking about this restaurant and the food for days afterward so 10 10 would recommend
1093,for some reason there s only a few hotels that actually look like their photos the saint hotel is definitely one of them it was exceptional we had a king size bed room and it was perfect size the whole hotel vibe is very miami vegas style and i felt like everything in there was instagramable from he chairs to the mirrors to the drapes very well put together i looked thru their book of other autograph collection hotels and i would totally stay in one of them the service was great too everyone from front desk to the bartender were very nice professional also the location is good it is noisy tho we were on the fourth floor and could hear everything but that s a given youre in new orleans only a couple blocks away from bourbon and literally on canal street you don t have to go too far to get somewhere
1094,delicious food their hot sauce is one of the best i ve ever had so flavorful and actually spicy which is nice
1095,fabulous salon with excellent well trained staff it s always a fun treat yo self experience coming here you can enjoy a complimentary glass of champagne wine or sparkling water while getting pampered they have ample color options and always stocked with the latest color trends my personal fav is number opi 117 super cute
1096,i love this place tacos are simple but delicious the chips with all the different sauces are amazing as well you also cannot beat the drinks from the house margarita to the kalesi everything is just delicious the set up of the restaurant open and you have to see the decorations to really understand them also don t forget to walk past the bathrooms to the secret tiki bar it s fun in the winter but even better in the summer if you have room get the mexican poutine it s amazing
1097,my new favorite spot fantastic food and service so good that i keep thinking about my next visit we got the samurai omasake and it did not disappoint everything was so fresh and flavorful chef rexley crafted each piece with care and precision and his staff provided awesome service so glad that there s finally a real sushi joint in the area tampa bay was seriously lacking in that department and sushi sho can definitely fill that void can t wait to be back
1098,my wife and have been here many times it s a small home town style restaurant the food here is great the portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable the owner and staff are very friendly and personable this place is a diamond in the rough and if you are in the area give it a try
1099,what a great little small business they got me in quickly the garage was warm and inviting the decor was modern and fun flat panel tv couch coffee and an orange wall not to mention a sweet dog that says hello the staff was very nice and they fixed my one window in about 20 minutes top we will definitely use them in the future won t be disappointed
1100,great experience everyone was so nice and they did a great job on my sometime hard to work with hair i got a braid done and it was gorgeous
1101,we have used alpine lock several times over the years they are always dependable punctual efficient and very professional i will continue to use them jake came out today and did a great job and everyone we have used from alpine are well trained professional efficient and reasonably priced you can t go wrong with them they are the best
1102,ordered the crispy hipcity ranch buffalo style it was pretty good the sweet potato fries were amazing the staff looked miserable

1109,overall a very good experience for three out of our group of four our friends had the barley soup salad and prime rib and said it was very good i had the bass with coconut rice mushrooms bok choy and curry sauce the fish was cooked perfectly and almost melted in my mouth the coconut rice was light with subtle flavor of coconut the mushrooms were flavorful the bok choy would had been good if they had put less butter on it which overpowered the bok choy not sure about the curry sauce i felt like it didn t pair well with the rest of the dish presentation was nice my husband had the pasta with three cheese sauce and chicken the chicken was reportedly dry and the sauce was very heavy additionally the chicken portion was small in proportion to the pasta amount my husband asked for both chicken and shrimp as there was a choice in between the two proteins and we don t mind paying more but this was too much to ask for because the meat was pre portioned overall the service was excellent attentive staff we were seated promptly had a reservation the place is nice and clean

1119,used groupon for a better deal i was excited to try out this place because i ve never ate down on a wharf before and i was in santa barbara doing sb buggy so i thought this place would be perfect for dinner parking can be found on the streets or public parking building or park on the wharf seating wait time depending of if you want fa first available o outside i inside seating i prefer the outside seating because there are more space to put your dishes and you get the view of the ocean so why not i thought this place would bigger than i thought there are bar seating inside and table seating outside restroom 1 only food dungeness crab 2 2 5 lbs for 23 95 lb it came with a whole crab and butter dipping sauce it was fresh and tender really good recommend crab cakes 13 95 it was good but nothing really special about it the tartar sauce was really good with it calamari pasta 14 95 the calamari was fresh and tender and flavorful along with the pasta new england style clam chowder 7 95 for a bowl of soup it was ehh i thought it would be tastier since a lot of people rave about it i would skip this service very tentative and friendly

1121,writing this four weeks after my manicure and my gel is perfect they were super friendly and professional

1123,the food is delicious here the coconut chicken is amazing however i went to this location today for my 1 hour lunch and the service was terrible my server came by to take my order and drink and i didn t see her until 30 minutes later the table next to me had an excellent gentlemen who was always checking on the patron i had to ask him for my drink i wanted to ask for another plate but i couldn t even do so because my server was so inattentive she finally came by after the 30 minutes asking if i needed anything and she most likely only came by because i put out my card at that point i was so frustrated and i needed to leave so i wasn t able to ask for a manager needless to say she got a 1 tip i was being courteous it should have been 0
1124,excellent breakfast i currently have someone in the family at vanderbilt hospital and the walk from the hospital was not bad at all in fact it did some of us well to get out of the hospital service was great our waitress took great care of us i got the country ham breakfast but substituted my 3 buttermilk pancakes for 1 santa fe pancake this was the best decision i made the santa fe is cornmeal based almost like southern flat cornbread it s mixed with green chilis cheese and bacon it comes with butter not really needed picante sauce and sour cream i just lathered it up and it was great country ham and eggs were wonderful overall highly recommend especially if you have family in the hospital good escape from the place
1125,what an incredible little joint warm caring and extremely efficient people got a quick appointment for a pedicure and manicure via phone there are no bells and whistles from the outside but they more than make up for it inside with the decor cleanliness and their impeccable service pedicure there are several options i got the spa pedicure with rose petals and this was simply the best pedicure i have gotten in a long long time absolutely no rushing took her time to get things done properly the massaging chairs are perfect for this it runs a 20minute cycle this specific pedicure comes with a foot pack followed by sea salt scrub and the usual nail treatments along with feet scrubbing followed by a 15 minute 20 minute 25 minute leg massage depending on which pedicure you choose they use a timer to let you know they are not kidding about the time finally ended it with a hot stone massage and polish i felt so pampered with all the innumerable little things they did manicure chose the regular manicure with mini paraffin wax this was awesome i loved how detailed they are and yet somehow did things without making you feel rushed this manicure comes with a short burst of shoulder massage too the people who work there are very friendly and i have found my favourite little hidden gem of a nail salon
1126,people were friendly and provided great customer service we arrived before the store opened we were still on texas time and were 4th in line which would have made us fourth to be helped with the exception of those who had appointments but we weren t they opened the door and said we made a note of who came in when so we ll take people in this order then started calling out vehicle makes and colors without any regard to who actually got there first they completely skipped us didn t even have our vehicle marked on their list and when we politely mentioned we weren t on the list we got an okay as a response a quick and easy flat repair turned into an hour of us sitting and waiting while they helped at least 2 customers who arrived after us other than that it s discount tire as you would expect it to be
1127,great authentic food and excellent staff felt like a guest at there home the dishes were more than enough and the bread is excellent kept my glass topped of too i definitely recommend if your in the mood for indian food
1128,visited at 11am on a saturday ordered a lavender vanilla latte so good and a pour over took a long time for the pour over to get to us and it came with a complimentary donut because of the wait so sweet a must visit
1129,just a disclaimer to start this off as a teetotaler my review has absolutely nothing to do with the alcohol also i was provided vouchers for free food but i try not to let this affect my review i have come here twice for the food mainly chicken wings their traditional caesar wings is great it has excellent flavour even if it is a bit greasy and the servers are kind enough to provide little wet wipes for that their honey garlic wings are quite nice too and they both come with a nice side of celery and dip which pairs quite well as a teetotaler i ve only tried their sodas but it s quite a nice touch that the sodas are bottomless and very reasonably priced i expect this is to promote sensible and sober driving my main recommendation is to try to come in when it s less busy the noise levels can quite easily get out of hand in this place and the servers are very attentive when the place isn t too packed
1130,i travel often for work and having a box that feels like home is a big deal was able to make two drop ins at the downtown location and could not have been happier phil guillot was a fantastic coach the format and style were great and the location and space were phenomenal now the expectations for my home box have been raised and i wish i lived closer
1131,this place is a hidden gem we had the hot italian sub with mozzarella pasta salad we also tried 3 wines and ended up getting the rose and a sangria mazzaro s offers absolutely everything when it comes to italian dishes go hungry you will not be disappointed
1132,this place has really stepped up their game their food has always been excellent but they have also added cute decor and a fast lunch menu they change up the menu fairly often to add fresh in season menu items which i love but it appears they keep some favorites on there as well my husband and i frequent this restaurant for dinner and brunch on the weekends most recently we went for dinner and ordered the asparagus appetizer so crispy and fresh i had the cubano sandwich that had a touch of sweetness some tangy from the mustard and the pork was well seasoned and tender he ordered the stl masterpiece which was a burger cooked to perfection and piled high with cheeses bbq sauce and spicy mayo so tasty we are worried because the restaurant never seems to be that busy but it s really awesome
1133,i took my bmw 528 in for some body work on the trunk and rear quarter panel although the estimate was a little higher than others i was very impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of jennifer and decided to go with goldies the repairs and paint job were outstanding and my car was ready when promised i d give the body work an a i also paid for an interior and exterior detailing for 250 the air vents and dash area look brand new which is amazing since my car is a 1997 the rubber around the sunroof was missed and i learned the window hadn t been opened so there was no opportunity to see what needed to be cleaned there chips in the paint were touched up jennifer said the wax should last for 30 days which i didn t think was great i d give the detailing job a b
1134,ordered online and pizza was ready upon arrival 15 minutes later as ordered lite sauce as specified the price was right and placing the online order was easy peasy we were happy we were able to pull up pick up the order and keep it moving thanks to the manager that was helping to keep the flow moving yay and yay happy happy joy joy

1137,went in because the tire light came on after filling the tire with air 2 times within 5 days first called costco to make an appointment and was told they didn t have any availability for the week walked in around 9 30am on a saturday without an appointment because i happen to be in the area and was out by around noon smallish waiting area with coffee tv magazines and bathroom nothing fancy but enough to make wait bearable got my car back and was told they had to fix one of the rear tires and it was free of charge costco would have cost around 15 appreciate the friendly service
1138,bbq chicken pizza was the best i will come back here before any of the high priced places that have average flavors i love the price most of all
1139,we had brunchuru at ichicoro ane in st petersburg this past saturday and it was simply delightful for starters we had lightly tempura fried cauliflower bao bun that were garnished with a pickled cucumber carrots and micro greens laid on top of hot sauce can you say love at first bit because that s exactly what it was my youngest daughter indulged in the bubble waffle this is a french toast bubble waffle stuffed with guava and cream cheese served with guava syrup so beautifully delish sorry i don t have a picture just try it my oldest daughter and i both had miso ramen topped with ajitama half boiled egg in a soy sauce the miso paired with carmalized onions mushrooms bamboo shoots and impossible burger were like a symphony playing in my mouth the ladies topped their entree s off by sharing dessert they had the halo halo it comes in a tall sundae glass and is comprised of shaved ice condensed milk ube ice cream flan adzuki beans black sesame shaved coconut guava candy so yummy to the tummy i topped my miso ramen off with so shu shch a distilled smooth beverage that puts you in the mind of light bodied whiskey i could have so shu as a after dinner drink on most occasions our waiter huan h was very polite easy going and helpful he makes dining at ichicoro ane top notch ichicoro ane is a great way to start the weekend
1140,i ve lived in philly for 10 years and i can t believe i m just finding bourbon and branch now a favorite everything we had was delicious mac cheese fried chicken mushroom stroganoff braised pork fries me and my family like to eat a lot worth every calorie and dollar the staff was really nice and service was on point my dad is really annoying and asks a million questions when going out to eat the waitress and host were both super patient and sweet with his million and one questions i think their names were cameron and mickey and everything was decently priced will definitely be going back also great atmosphere go
1141,my wife and i had lunch here today and it was excellent i had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey club and they were some of the best sandwiches we ve ever had the service was also great we will definitely eat here again
1142,it s a dollar to add an extra sauce for the wings and this is with no warning from the waitress kind if annoying to get the receipt and see that it was also difficult to flag her down still she was friendly and polite and the order was accurate food was delicious we got the wings potato skins and their famous spinach dip everything was cooked to perfection generous portions food came in about 20 minutes while we drank beer was tasty and went down easily i liked the selection happy hour was nice with a dollar off drafts and half price apps
1143,i have gone to this minute clinic two times in the past month and have been so pleased with the service care the nps are fabulous and so good with kids the pharmacy techs are awesome too if you need a quick care clinic i would highly recommend them no more urgent care clinics for us
1144,had brunch on a saturday food was delicious service was great great atmosphere will definitely put this place in my rotation of favorite spots
1145,in my previous review i said this place didn t earn 5 stars because of the wait well the wait is over you can now check in online and see how long till it s your turn and it s pretty accurate now my visits include vibrating chairs while you get your scalp washed although i m not sure they actually do anything albany is still my go to for haircuts that hasn t change this place finally got the 5 stars it deserves congrats,odd location but unique find it s simple but well done if i wasn t on a carbless diet i d be here more often although i enjoy the bibimbaps my favorite here is the chap jae noodles my daughter and i can t get enough of them service is also friendly and awesome great spot for the college kids nearby a little bit of an inconvenience for me south reno
1146,this restaurant is by far the best middle eastern restaurant in kenner city and surrounding areas the food is beyond exceptional with culture and authenticity seeping through every plate that i have ever tried at this establishment try the stuffed grape leaves not to mention the family like service that is given here especially by one server aly is the best food and beverage employee anyone can acquire she knows me by name every time i walk in and can recite my order to me before i know it always thanks ally
1147,we stumbled upon this place on or way back to the car and to not take forever to decide where to eat we just decided here when they were sitting us i checked the ratings and i don t know why it has 3 stars got a little scared but we tried the hibachi and it was good my favorite was the shrimp really good flavor least favorite was the chicken i also didn t like that they didn t have noddles but the service was nice and our cook was too we tried the sushi sampler it wasn t the great the place could look neater and cleaner feel
1148,great breakfast spot in the quarter very busy noisy and tight seating but the service was overly friendly and the vibe was upbeat took a while to get food but judging how busy they were it was expected the flavored mimosas were great food was delish and it wasn t overly priced i ll try to return to this place anytime i m visiting the french quarter during breakfast time
1149,great location service and the food was delish we started with the bada bing salad it was loaded with the biggest sweetest and tangiest cherries blue cheese and almonds it was absolutely fantastic we selected the gringo 3 0 pizza which is basically their version of a taco pizza warning it carries some heat
1150,everyone should stay at a gaylord resort at least once in their life you truly won t be disappointed our agenda this last trip to nashville was strictly going to see a show at the opry luck would have it i was able to snag a room on a saturday night when the town was hopping with concerts galore all over the city i have seen parts of this resort in my other trips there but realized pretty quick that there s more to see once on the grounds parking is a bit tricky finally found a human who directed us to self parking they offer valet but it was closed this particular day there are not a lot of open spots in self parking so you may want to valet i m not sure of the cost of valet but self was 29 with in and out privileges once in the lobby we were directed to the correct check in line as this place was packed the hotel is broken up into 3 main categories cascades delta magnolia each one is its one little world and all are connected as well we were in magnolia found our way to our room via map and got settled in room was typical there is outside access from each room with a patio which is nice the opry and the opry mills mall are all easily accessible from the resort by resort shuttle which is included in your daily resort fee the run shuttles for both literally all day and night which is super nice the drivers are awesome and very engaging with the guests your resort fee also includes other fun perks but we were not there long enough to enjoy them i m giving 4 stars because of check out which is really my only issue one of the staff members told us and another couple that if we gave them our room key they would be checked out and our bill would be emailed to us so we did that and i never got the final bill i tried contacting and never heard back no biggie in reality but if you re going to tell your guests that please do it if not in nashville for downtown check out gaylord it was pretty amazing
1151,omg the bacon is sooo good the donuts are a delicious treat what a fun restaurant i would definitely recommend it s right around the corner from pancake pantry
1152,the best shrimp and grits and biscuits and gravy at first my family was on the fence because it was a small restaurant far away from our hotel but the food surprised us all we couldn t believe how amazing it was and would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to adventure out of the tourist area in new orleans and see how the real civilians live
1153,ended my trip with j s in the french market coupled with a pint and a pina colada smoothie from the booth to the left my date and i were ready to take on more oysters we split an order of jambalaya a dozen charbroiled oysters a dozen raw oysters and a pound of boiled shrimp the charbroiled oysters were definitely not as good as the ones on bourbon street but the raw dozen made up for the others shortcomings skip the shrimp and come during crawfish season i got my hopes up thinking crawfish was available off season as it was still written on the chalkboard menu definitely made the mistake of not ordering the shrimp and grits stuff looked mouth watering this place is expensive but everything is served up fresh and made to order it seems don t forget to tip the bad motha shucka
1154,we just got back from our anniversary dinner and we were not really impressed with the fleming s experience much better filets at the other we ll know steak houses in the city now the service was five star jamie our water made the meal pleasant knows his wines thanks jamie
1155,highly recommend i really enjoyed everything from the atmosphere staff and food i was with 3 others and we just shared a bunch of things everyone agreed that the brussel sprouts were in the top 3 the curry on them made them spicy but not overpowering i also really enjoyed the avocado crispy rice with chicken shawarma it was a very interesting dish with the crunchy rice but very delicious the reuben was also a fun small plate to taste one downfall was they were out of bacon ehhhh such a bummer we got the pork shank instead but it wasn t the same oh and don t forget to get the whipped feta our waiter recommended and i m glad he did th mixed drinks were not my fav we didn t know half the ingredients i got a beet drink but it was a little too gingery for me overall they were fine i would definitely go back here again hopefully they have the bacon next time
1156,fresh ingredients delicious flavors and wonderful ambience can t wait to come back and try the rest of the menu
1157,came here with a few friends for some drinks and tapas wow 10 10 would recommend great atmosphere lovely staff awesome drinks most importantly delicious food
1158,the food is really good i tried the calamari app bruschetta and meatballs all were great the dinner special was a steak topped with scallops and shrimp with melted cheese it was perfect i d definitely recommend this restaurant
1159,the adult pricing seemed to be a lititle pricey 15 each 30 2 on top of the kids pricing but my 2 and 3 year old had a lot of fun exploring the areas in this museum were well thought out and kept them entertained for 2 hours,i went here based off of reviews the place was not bad but i went in expecting more i think a 3 star review is appropriate based off of the meal i had which was a skillet so potatoes sausage eggs tomatoes cheese with a muffin and a side of grits pretty simple so maybe the other reviews were based off of specialties
1160,arrived yesterday we have been so happy at this resort rooms are big and look newly renovated the inside of the resort is like a city with shops restaurants water show live music boat ride everything is kept up so well for such a big property with thousands of rooms nothing looks worn highly recommend a stay at this resort
1161,now doing breakfast i had to see if they did a real omelette not a frittata folded over but a real omelette and the answer is yes everything made to order and from scratch and to order including my biscuits and gravy it may take a few minutes longer than you re used too as a result but if you re willing to wait it s well worth it vegi omelette home fries biscuit and gravy all spot on
1162,they were out of multiple products i waited almost an hour for an egg sandwich and yet someone who ordered 20 min after me got their food food was good though and he did apologize for my wait although it shouldn t take almost an hour for food
1163,amazing fried oyster salad crawfish bisque i ll be dreaming about that salad great service we walked in with a 9 month old and 4 year old were nervous but were seated in the back kids behaved dinner was amazing wish we would have ordered more off the menu
1164,these guys took our second car furniture and 100 boxes from our 3rd floor apartment with only stairs and no elevator from lansdale pa to louisville kentucky in just 2 days everything arrived safely with nothing broken and we were treated like we were their only customer the price quoted didn t change at the time of payment either these guys are very professional and a joy to work with in a very nervous time
1165,came here for lunch with a large group on a saturday they sat us quickly in the dining section there s a separate entrance to the right for dining in the place was much bigger than i realized i ordered an adult beverage some sort of alcoholic strawberry lemonade delicious i got the vito panini prosciutto mozeralla tomato it was so good everyone s food looked good no complaints they have some interesting menu choices for pizza i d like to go back for the pizza the decor is fun murals on the walls and ceilings combining local and italian history great neighborhood it felt a little crowded but it could have been because they pushed tables together for out 10 group
1166,my wife daughter in law son and i were thankful yesterday evening to visit the cake bake shop for the second time each a birthday celebration the shop is a treasure the decor is enchanting and all of the cake slices that we have savored have been delectable both experiences have been elevated from delightful to exceptional however by our server kristen in addition to providing to us superb service she has been so charming and has enabled us to feel as if we are special guests thank you we anticipate eagerly our next opportunity to visit,i requested service because my gas oven heating was unreliable sometimes when turned on it would heat as expected other times it would not heat and i would smell natural gas odor i was delighted from the beginning of the process to the end the person who answered my phone call on monday and scheduled my appointment was friendly and helpful appointment was scheduled for wednesday which was earlier than appointments offered to me by other appliance repair services that i had called communication from company by phone email and text was well timed and clear repair technician was on time and personable he diagnosed the problem and fixed it efficiently he had based on the description that i had given when requesting the appointment anticipated the cause and brought with him the required replacement component an igniter the company waived the service call charge i paid for the repair parts and labor only
1167,the best bbq in the area we had the ribs and they were absolutely delicious i recommend the sweet sauce but all the sauces were good the onion rings are spectacular great baked beans even the cream spinach was delicious our server was friendly and helpful we can t wait to go back and bring some friends
1168,ok i have had persian food before as it is one of my favorite so i was little disappointed with the food i had chicken koobideh i had little chicken in it s taste and a lot of eggish taste koobideh is more like keema chicken from my experience with nice mix of onions chilly and seasoning so on part of taste i rate it apart that uber interior good service upper class experience food portion is generous and good enough for 2 for one order over all ok ok i would liked if they had served hummus and pita bread in their welcome also server salad as their sides middle eastern food is said to have perfect balance of carbs protein and fiber but it was found missing to call it a middle eastern fine dinner
1169,had to check out this spot seen on every youtube vlog ever luckily for us our airbnb was only 2 blocks away when you walk inside you can purchase bottles of wine and cheese to enjoy outside if you d like to try their tapas head outside and order at the window there s also a bar serving other drinks upstairs they have live music every night at 7 30pm we went around 9pm and enjoyed a selection of tapas and their risotto i was very fond of their pickled veggies and patatas bravas great food great prices great hangs for a perfect evening
1170,liz did a great job in serving up the food everything she brought our was very tasty i had chips with salsa black bean soup and the palomila steak with fries was full of flavor good find
1171,classic iconic old hotel not sure i ll stay again as city noise is a crap shoot depending on floor and street facing royal street can get noisy i was on the 6th floor beware of cabbies outside of the hotel who can t speak english
1172,creamy yummy ice cream this place also has a vegan chocolate flavor made from coconut milk
1173,amazing biscuits and gravy they were huge if you are in the area stop in and try them you won t be let down
1174,what a pleasant surprise in st louis i live in la so i didn t expect any good chinese food around here but this place is legit i m northern chinese myself and the flavors are authentic and the portion sizes are generous my mom ordered from here and she got twice cooked pork lamb skewers eggplant and another pork dish all dishes were perfection this will be my new go to chinese when i m in town
1175,this was one of my favorite spots in the city every underrated until i went about a month ago the menu change was not a great one the chicken and waffles was my favorite item on the old menu it was sweet savory large portioned etc but the new is very basic then the french toast has changed at well wasnt happy please bring back the old menu the positive though still a great atmosphere and great music
1176,this is our first time absolutely excellent food and fantastic service very nice find
1177,spicy noodle drunken noodle was very good both of our curries red curry with chicken and panang curry with beef left a lot to be desired they were runny and the taste was off my thai iced tea was good service was mediocre it was very challenging to get her attention she told us we could each get glasses of water but only brought one she brought a second glass for another person after the meal was over she would never make eye contact or refill drinks
1178,bab is the perfect meal it s everything you need in one bowl and it s delicious the bab cafe is so trendy friendly nutritious and amazing i love that all of the bowls come with a cup of miso soup it really is all good for your health and good health is good for your soul it s family soul food they have little sayings that explain bab family the staff were all very friendly and helpful also
1179,we tried this place out because it was in the passport program we started out with a couple glasses of wine and a sauted calamari the calamari was nicely cooked and had a pretty good broth but could have used a little salt our entrees were great though i had a lamb special which was incredible and my wife s pasta was also very good a couple weird things 1 the space is a little small to the point where the servers are tripping over each other 2 the music choice was strange for an italian place mid 90s country i wasn t looking for dean martin or anything but it was an odd choice
1180,typical boston pizza fare however the staff were wonderful we were a large group and they were so very accommodating the waitresses were all over the kids in a good way and so kind this is a reg spot for us now largely because of the staff
1181,disclaimer i am not a native st louisan which is why my review is important lol very often the locals will suggest that you try imo s pizza i m encouraging you to give fortel s a try instead of imo s imo s is terrible tastes as if it is made of cheese whiz plastic instead of fresh ingredients i d be embarrassed to call imo s st louis style pizza i do however like pi pizzeria a lot but decided to give them a break try fortel s instead i must admit to being pleasantly surprised by the taste of fortel s pizza you know in the back of my mind i thought oh god st louis style however fortel s shut my negative thoughts up quickly with the quality of their pizza from their customer service to the freshness of the ingredients thumbs up fortel s now give your servers their tips when we pay by way of a credit card
1182,this place is centrally located and perfect for our time in santa barbara the employees went out of their way to make it a great stay very appreciative
1183,went for first time yesterday and will go back for certain had the bucatini carbonara small plate and it was best i ve ever eaten and a great mojito friendly efficient staff loved it all
1184,excellent food great service family owned and operated business and it shows try the white pizza with broccoli rabe
1185,this review is so long overdue what an awesome little restaurant was a little nervous to eat here initially as the restaurant was a bit empty but the hostess was so inviting we had to stay we started with the blt guac recommended by the hostess and was so glad we did the addition of bacon and the fried pita crisps i believe just set the guac off right we also added the wings as an appetizer which i d give a 4 out of 5 the rest of our meal while yummy was is a bit of a blur because we got so tipsy off the carnitas margarita which is fresh made with all top shelf liquor it s quite pricey but would def recommend in a pitcher shared amongst 3 4 ppl just beware because that drink will creep up on you i would highly recommend if you re in the area but dont be fooled by the small store front because there s alot of good things going on inside including pretty funky cool decor
1186,this is the tastiest ramen in tucson the broth is rich and filling the egg preparation is the only thing lacking in this soup overcooked cold and plopped in as afterthought not seasoned chashu is very yummy way better than oban karage don is also very good the service is busy but friendly go for weekday lunch to avoid the lines at this new and popular spot i ll be back many times
1187,had best meal in 10 years fantastic service by chris with as promised best steak in tucson appetizers were phenomenal definitely will be back and forgot to mention live music
1188,i highly recommend stopping here for a snack lunch and coffee the coffee and the service were both great i will definitely be back with friends
1189,we ate here again recently and the food and the service were both very good we just had a couple of gyros with pita chips so i can t comment on the rest of the menu but the gyros are very good
1190,the carbonara and seafood linguine were fantastic large portions and definitely had plenty to take home best in italian in media hands down
1191,this is my second time here in less than a month we had prime rib steaks lobster and all of the sides delicious will we return absolutely lovely ambiance wait staff was on top of everything can t wait to return
1192,this is the finest indian restaurant i have ever dined the naan breads are excellent and all of the entries were superb the spices and flavors are nicely blended especially the chicken tiki marsala you will not find a better indian restaurant anywhere in philadelphia service was impeccable the chef is very well trained and classically prepares his dishes with attentiveness to the tastes and spice blends and it is a byob so prices are very reasonable
1193,perfect did a great job for a reasonable price prompt courteous highly recommended
1194,came for brunch on a sunday good food good music great service away from the hustle and bustle of the french quarters but so worth a relaxing wine down brunch or whenever you decide to come only thing that s on you good company i had that other than that they have you covered i had the crab cake benedict comes with one and has brown more like breakfast potatoes my partner had steak and eggs i tasted some it wasn t over seasoned it was just right with no need for a1 sauce she finished every bite which doesn t happen often
1195,love this place everytime a get a chance i stop by and leave with more than i intended to purchase they have the freshest pastries bread and hot food but the best item they sell is coffee i have to say that i m a coffee addict and they have me hooked i would even say that they are better than starbucks can t get enough of this place
1196,very good sushi and service i really like the crab rangoon appetizer it is very flavorful unlike most places which are kinda bland my wife likes the thai food a lot after our first visit we have been back many times i am writing this review from the sushi bar
1197,the flavor is almost there but the pie totally undercooked too much sauce undercooked and not enough toppings crust is good but undercooked even our 2 year old pizza crazy man wouldn t eat it i don t know if it s the oven the number of people ovens maybe they can t handle the volume but it s not working out
1198,i used too go to this spa yrs ago but i decided to try others so saying that i am going back for a spring pedi soon as they are friendl and do not rush you so when you leave you do feel relax i hope jen is still there as she used to do my pedi
1199,love imperial best snoballs around anna and maddie are the best employees also we stan frank
1200,the food here is really solid and the staff is fantastically friendly i get the brisket and sausage combo with two small sides plus free soft served ice cream for the taking the downside the east parking lot is a disaster is trap with low hanging tree branches that scraped my paint also at busy times the design to get condiments and drinks is bad it creates traffic congestion as you have to fight across an aisle to get drinks pickles etc
1201,color selection is limited staff workers don t understand much english which makes it difficult to communicate what the costumer wants but overall polish is clean and well done i recommend calling ahead for an appointment or you ll just be waiting around all day
1202,united van lines made my move absolutely painless donna mcgee is absolutely wonderful i expressed to her that i needed to move asap from the midwest to the west coast and she set up an appointment for me to get a quote for the next day the next day she called me expressing she found movers that could come just 4 days later she would call me every other day with updates the actual movers at pick up were punctual and quick but careful with my things they were friendly and answered all of my questions after pick up donna would give me updates about every other day regarding the status of my delivery which took just a week the delivery workers were also wonderful and amicable the quote for this company was also much more reasonable than other quotes i had received from other companies who were much harder to communicate with i thought moving would be an awful experience but they made this an absolutely stress free experience thank you
1203,very nice facility everything s top notch why they have one real restaurant for breakfast is beyond belief only 1 you can drink starbucks until your head explodes and eat that food but otherwise you wait in line forever this place holds thousands of people and there are around a dozen restaurants open for lunch and dinner but breakfast forget it
1204,we came here about 5 30pm on a saturday we had purchased a groupon when it was high sierra brewing and had checked with them and confirmed they would honor it this is an expansion of a brewery from portland oregon they were having a bbq buffet for 10 to benefit fallen officers our groupon was for a beer taster flight an appetizer and two entrees the place was pretty busy and most tables and the bar area we re fully seated it was not like that the last time we came in we were initially seated at a table in the bar area but a server came by and said they had a booth open and she was less busy than the area we were initially seated my wife ordered the club sandwich and i ordered the brewery style french dip our appetizer beer tasters and entrees were delivered in a timely fashion everything looked and tasted delicious the food was good the beer was good and the service was awesome it was a good experience and we will be back to try something else
1205,we travelled to nashville with ten friends for my wife s birthday we called all around the city and americano was the only restaurant that was willing to take a reservation for a group of twelve without a pre fixe menu or a strange dining time like 9p since our group was from several states we wanted one chill sit down dinner together that wasn t on the fly luckily we are huge tapas fans and frankly a lot of the food in nashville is similar southern bbq so this gave us a chance to switch it up i only mention all of the above because americano was sooooo accommodating and friendly george the owner and david the waiter were absolutely amazing david personally thanked all of us personally for coming in and it couldn t have been more heartfelt i love helping small businesses that appreciate the business anyway the food was spectacular i had sangria while others had other drinks everyone was very happy we ordered lots of food for the twelve of us the plates were the tuna poke tostadas ceviche the chopped kale the brussel sprouts tasted like vegetable candy shishito peppers flank steak pintxos de camarones shrimp and two paellas we also had flan and chocolate cake all the dishes were amazing but i particularly loved the tostadas and the brussel sprouts we spared no expense and kept ordering but overall the bill was very reasonable for what we got if you are from out of town and want to make sure you have a reservation this is a great restaurant if you are a couple living in town wanting a change in food and a romantic night this is a great restaurant i wish this restaurant was in massachusetts where i live between the food and the southern hospitality it is a great spot
1206,absolutely one of the best mex food i have had ever flat out 10 in every way food 10 drinks 10 musica 11 ambiance 10 food food food 10 10 11
1207,this place is a real treat to have in the northwest delicious italian food inventive cocktails and a wonderful outdoor space overlooking kelly drive the chicken parm appetizer is a favorite a whole chicken leg and thigh and a delicious tangy marinara with cheese i will often get it with a salad as my entre i love that they have plenty of bicycle racks for their guests as well,the best dentist i ve ever gone to from major bridgework to routine cleanings i ve been a regular customer for close to 15 years now from day one the staff has been wonderful friendly and genuinely concerned they do everything they can to make you feel like a guest gilbert himself is terrific and has always done excellent work on the rare occasion that there s been a problem he and his staff have been quick and polite to address it at this point it s hard to imagine going anywhere else for my dental work
1208,dope got three tacos asada pollo asada carnits they have two styles gringo and street um if you ordered your taco with a flower tortilla you should get the gringo toppings because you ve already ruined your taco i got corn and street which is traditional anyway they were great between 2 50 3 per taco
1209,noble crust is amazing the atmosphere is quite modern a bit busy on the weekend but so worth the wait the food is amazing i recommend the fried chicken and the scallop with pomegranate squash it is delicious will definitely go again i prefer the wesley chapel location instead of dale mabry the chef in wesley chapel is very presentable with his dishes
1210,first of all the interior is nice really intimate if you get a chance check out the upstairs lounge that overlooks the street so to the food we started with the poke i thought it was pretty good a lot of interesting textures and bites but a little to acidic the hazelnut and ricotta ravioli though blew my socks off only came with 5 6 of them but they were fantastic and rich for an entree we shared the salmon with artichokes and potatoes though i heard the fried chicken is a marquee item i felt in the mood for something slightly healthier the broth served underneath the salmon was delicious and the salmon itself was cooked to perfection i wish it came with crostini s or something to soak up that tasty garlic clam broth definitely need to come back and try new dishes and for brunch the ricotta ravioli and salmon are must gets
1211,bbq shrimp large serving of really big shrimp in a too die for sauce a bit messy but they dress you for it and oh so delicious i finished the sauce with a spoon once the shrimp were gone great creme brulee as well an excellent meal
1212,i was very much delighted by the customer service i received at 4pm on 2 13 2018 i went in to order a chicken burrito and because i had to wait for the chicken to be cooked i was treated to a free beverage while i waited when the chicken was ready not even minutes later i was given generous portions when i went to pay the cashier let me know my meal was on them i was surprised i have been to another chipotle location closer to my home and have walked out because no one greeted or helped me i will definitely be coming back to this store as customer service goes a long way in retaining customers at chains thank you very much
1213,the food was fantastic but the service was not so great our server disappeared halfway through our meal i told our server it was my boyfriends birthday when we arrived and he said he would make it special for him but we never saw him again the food was great though i highly recommend the skillet tacos and natural margarita
1214,excellent burgers get the nashvegas and great beer selection the bushwackers are good too also get the sweet carolina fries heaven
1215,pros super flavorful avocado asparagus salad super flavorful tom kha soup very friendly never had a bad dish yet kid friendly cons none overall highly recommended best thai restaurant near ventura
1216,for a cidery this place has an astonishing lack of ciders we popped in after hyping ourselves up for a delicious cider on our usual thursday date night we got a flight of all of their ciders only 4 and decided there was only one of those we half liked and the rest we did not like at all and had to force down i think we like dry ciders not a lot of hops with a hint of sweetness but the ciders here were all too sweet too hoppy or just plain gross recommend going to cinder if you want to try a bunch of ciders though not all of theirs are locally brewed obviously since it s a cider pizza bar not a cidery
1217,inconsistent we were so excited to try this lovely atmospheric restaurant the setting and our waiter were wonderful but our food overall batted about 50 the hamburger was terrific one dish with pork tenderloin was great but the ways and means dish was not good and the fries served with the hamburger were cold the cheese plate appetizer was disappointing old grapes and very little fruit way too skimpy the bread pudding was very good the custard was cold refrigerated and only fair gosh this restaurant could be great but we were disappointed
1218,i heard festive latin music as i stood at the corner of broad and lombard and couldn t figure out where it was coming from then i saw illegal tacos lit up and open i d been waiting for this place to open so i followed the music and crossed the street to check out their menu even though i had no intentions of trying anything at that moment i had just finished a 14 hour work day and wanted to get home asap while reviewing the menu a man approached me and invited me in to try anything i liked for free it turned out it was their first day and they were having a family and friends event it was late so nearly everything was picked over but i selected the shrimp taco bowl and took it home to enjoy despite the meager options available like i said it was the end of the night and they d run out of most of the usual taco toppings it was still delicious everything was so fresh and full of flavor another thing and this is a big deal to me their salsa verde had a really good bite most places skimp on the heat thinking it ll scare people away i suppose but this place knocked it out the park with just the right level of heat not too hot and certainly not a wimpy pepper in that sauce the staff was friendly the decor was good and the menu looked great i can t wait to try the soup oh and for the pc police get over it seriously no need to cry wolf considering an albanian likes mexican food and respects mexicans enough to not only honor their cuisine but to employ at least one mexican i m pretty sure he s not racist so stop accusing people of racism just because you re so brainwashed that you find offense in a restaurant name my interpretation of the name was that their tacos are so good they should be illegal and hey with the minimal amount they had leftover to give me the taco was still damn good maybe it should ve been illegal that it was that good with so little welcome to the neighborhood illegal tacos i now have a perfect option on my way home from work after another 14 hour day thank you
1219,they feature new beers all the time love this place patio is pet friendly food selection is good as well
1220,i would give this company more stars if i could i knew my youngest daughter had lice because her best friend had it and i saw nits eggs in her hair my friend gave me this company s name so i called and spoke to emily she promptly made me her next appointment in comes caroline and she was amazing very thorough while schooling me on everything she knew about lice how to get rid of and how to prevent for the future my youngest daughter was moderately infested and she worked so patiently getting out all of the lice she checked my entire family i highly recommend this company don t stress yourself out by using harmful pesticides this company will do all the work for you and tell you step by step instructions how to clean the home after an infestation
1221,great little unique place to check out good selection of cocktails and beer i tried the knickerbocker rum raspberries and triple sec it was delicious and strong the food is very reasonably priced and delicious the cuban is wonderful and i thoroughly enjoyed the st louis salad my only small complaint with the food was the royal grille sandwich the sandwich itself was great how they got mozzarella and cheddar to be that melty and delicious beats me so creamy the apples added a nice crunch and sweetness the bread was toasted perfectly however when paying an extra 2 for turkey to be added i expect more than one very thin slice i couldn t even taste or see the turkey without deconstructing the sandwich with that being said it was still a delicious sandwich i think our servers name was andrew he was very friendly and attentive the drinks and food came quickly we were in and out during peak dinner hours on a weekend evening in just under an hour will definitely return when we re in the area
1222,the food was terrific and the speciality cocktails were a bit of fresh air in the midst of a hot day in nashville a one of a kind with exceptional service a must for dinner
1223,got a basic manicure along with my wife they were very friendly upon arrival and make you feel comfortable visiting from la my technician hooked me up with some shiny healthy cuticles and nails also helpful tips on where to eat and visit thanks clayton nail spa
1224,this place is great they have a great happy hour and some of the best and largest oysters i ve ever seen the wait staff and hosts were very nice but my favorite employees were the oyster shuckers rob john and tim we got lucky enough to sit by them at the bar and they are super friendly and very funny they know a lot about the seafood and oysters if you like your oysters tip the shuckers they are skilled they have good cocktails and good beer and a great atmosphere i d also recommend the crawfish etouffe pies
1225,food is fantastic service is good not great just slow very friendly but slow won t keep me from going just hoping they improve it
1226,we were visiting friends in town and they suggested pancake pantry for breakfast there was a wait but it moved along the food was great as was the service the sweet potato waffles were a big hit with our group prices reasonable for the area give it a try when you re visiting
1227,was blown away by this place not the highest rated bbq place in town but tried it after a suggestion from a local i think i liked this place so much because the brisket rib is heavy on black pepper i like peppery meats and jerky so this peppery crusted brisket was right up my alley the sides were good and didn t seem like an after thought ribs were tender and fall off the bone
1228,savers is a great store for low prices and quality used clothing i have read some of the reviews and you ppl are rude arrogant and stingy first this is a used clothing store second it is not the hyatt so if there is a dirty water fountain or the store doesn t resemble a macy s and you got your tail feathers all ruffled ther is a mall about 20 min away go there stop yer bitchin
1229,this place is located near the garden district it is pretty small and my party of 6 had to be broken up into 2 tables that is how small this place is but that s ok i ordered their crab omelette and it was delicious usually with my omelette i stick with vegetables bacon etc but i had to try this it was well worth it and was not too heavy there is plenty of street parking just watch out for any signs that are permitted,this brewery was awesome it is incredibly large with plenty of picnic tables and games bunch of friendly folks too their beer selection is good based on the banners that were hung they ve won some awards too i got blueberry lemon gose which i think was a special they had at the moment that and the lime cucumber gose both had the tart flavor i was craving ugh this place was so good,great coffee spot they have a large selection of coffee teas and coffee and alcohol drinks i just got the iced latte and it satisfied my coffee craving,hmmm donuts they rotate through most flavors so it kind of just depends when you are there besides donuts they also serve some savory foods most of the people there were eating lunch chocolate donuts with homemade sprinkles amazing brown butter drop baked donut hole dense as it should be but still great cinnamon roll this was really good had the perfect amount of sweetness cinnamon and texture
1230,this restaurant is tucked away in south philly they had odd hours that close early for dinnertime so make sure to get there early it s byob and probably has a 10 15 tables so there can be a wait we sat down without a wait and ordered spring rolls would skip this next time chicken satay great skewers to start the meal papaya salad this is a pretty spicy dish if you request it my wife loved it and she also loves really spicy food i can handle my spice but it was a little too much for me eggplant this was a great dish and everyone loved it would order this again beef cubes i enjoyed this dish and similar to what you might get at a vietnamese restaurant fried rice lo mein good but these weren t the star of the show
1231,i don t get over here nearly enough this might be the smallest brewery in new jersey but it s also the friendliest chris and his wife are outstanding hosts oh yeah and the beer is just awesome
1232,i go to this costco all the time but i prefer the one in castleton i feel like it s much nicer and the staff is very helpful not that the staff is not helpful in both places i just prefer the castleton location better
1233,we decided to go on opening night and i m glad we went first off to all the haters who will make wise cracks about how this isn t authentic italian please get over it if authentic italian is what you re in the mood for then go for it i m a big fan of homemade pasta and authentic bolognese but that s not really what the old spaghetti factory is trying to be the decor it s clear that they ve gone to great expense to get that antique victorian decor just right i was impressed with their efforts everything was nicely decorated and they get bonus points for keeping the noise levels down the high ceilings and high backs on the booths help keep noise projected upward and not in your face the food i always keep it simple and go for the spaghetti with sausage and meatballs usually it s sausage or meatballs but sometimes i do both their marinara or meat sauce is tangy but not too sweet it deviates from the pasta sauces i usually endorse but for some reason i really like it service i m usually hesitant to do yelp reviews on a restaurant s opening night just for compassion purposes but they really did a good job tonight and seemed to have it together lots of corporate bigwigs were in attendance so we understandably had quite a few visits to our table to see how everything was going but i think time will prove this location to have great service for those of us who ve been waiting for the old spaghetti factory to come a little closer to home today was a good day in 30 years if i m still above ground i ll enjoy telling my grandkids that i was here on opening day
1234,wow so delicious comfort vegan food great portions full of flavor definitely will come back
1235,i agree with the other sentiments about the food and service at the new location have eaten at the old and new and this one just lacks i m curious to hear if they get their mojo back i really liked them in the previous location
1236,went here for late lunch after going to the art museum because it s nearby we sat inside an enclosed porch that bright and airy my meal was tasty i ordered a deeelicious cold wartermelon and tomato soup that was surprisingly filling i followed it up with a roasted vegetable sandwich that was flavorful but the sauce was a little loose so be mindful of the front of your shirt or blouse the fries were good without being over salted only had iced tea so i have no comment about the alcohol choices overall i d recommend this restaurant based on my meal and the reasonable price
1237,this place is great played there for 4 hours yesterday their neo geo arcade machine has over 100 titles including magical drop 2 fast paced match 3 some of the pinballs are good for their music alone guardians of the galaxy starts playing cherry bomb when you hit its 5 ball wizard mode keep hitting groot for multiball they have some rare stuff there too like the 3 level haunted house and the huge holographic time traveler game their addam s family game could be a museum piece it has a color display and like new playfield as far as thing not working just let them know and they ll get to it when they can i suggested they look for a tatio battle shark those aren t easy to find when i checked only 10 are owned by collectors on vaps vintage arcade preservation society i forgot to tell them a couple things ac dc needs a right flipper solenoid unplayable and caveman is playing at about 40 of the flipper strength it should have caveman was the first video pinball game and not easy to keep going i only know how it s supposed to play since i had one at a skating rink in the 80s try to beat 14 million the score only goes to 9 999 999
1238,great place to go for breakfast brunch lunch or whatever service is great selections are great for coffee tea and now beer and wine atmosphere is nice and laid back staff actually remembers your name
1239,this is an amazing place to get your pets groomed so glad that i found a local business to support that is efficient organized and responsive to pets and their owners
1240,outstanding dining experience the service is beyond exceptional the atmosphere is perfect and the food is incredible mr ronnie west made our early mother s day dinner very special i would highly recommend you request mr west if you plan to dine here absolutely the best restaurant in metairie
1241,this place was amazing honestly there aren t many restaurants in the area that offer individual hot pots and korean bbq the selection of foods and side dishes is huge and the customer service is great can t go wrong trying this place out definitely a place to go with friends and family
1242,such a cute little fun place bonus points for dog friendly bar and good beer it gets pretty crowded though pretzel was okay
1243,mediocre the staff isn t super great either seems like a bunch of angry hipsters versus friendly hipsters
1244,great place location ambience and friendly staff but pricey when your paying 12 15 for a drink in tampa
1245,we went for indy taco week and it was great some of the best chips salsa that i ve ever had calm down they re not free or endless which is probably why they re actually good we had the chicken tacos 5 stars and the pork tacos 4 stars with sweet potato wedges 6 stars and their version of borracho or refried beans which were meh the margarita was delicious and the mezcal mule was good according to my husband i m not a mezcal kind of gal a mez gal the service was present and accounted for but not friendly
1246,sasha is such an amazing hostess i walked in and had never been here before but she made me feel like an old friend coming to her home pleasant demeanor great recommendations made this an amazing evening along with the two spicy mules when you come in ask for a table in sacha s section
1247,excellent food and even better service real authentic mexican food they bring your chips out hot and crispy salsa is very good and they ll make it as hot or mild as you wish it has an attached grocery store where you can buy meats already seasoned the carne asada meat sold by the pound comes with chips salsa tortillas and everything you need to make them at home very affordable at last an authentic taqueria we frequent often just good folks cooking good food
1248,this restaurant is by far the best chinese food around i have been buying from them for well over 5 years and i have to say that i ve never had a bad meal they are so consistent with their food and the quality of everything they use is top notch from time to time i try a new place just because i live in metairie and don t want to make the drive uptown but i m always disappointed that i took the easy way out all of their dishes have different flavors because the sauces are all made differently so many chinese restaurants use the same sauces on different meats or shapes of chicken and give them different names but yet they taste exactly the same not august moon because they prepare and take pride in the preparation and taste of each and every dish they serve no more easy way out for this metairie girl
1249,best wings in the neighborhood also there is an amazing lunch special i have been going here since they were called mr wings back in the day the service is great and owner is really nice i love to support local small business especially in my neighborhood the wings are great and hot wings are the perfect spice and amazing taste they are not overly hot and spicy like alot of places so you can actually enjoy them im really not sure where else in the far northeast bensalem area you can get high quality chicken steak and hoagie i guess is my 2nd won t place due to the cheaper prices but quality as service is choose george s wings in a heartbeat
1250,while we were in santa barbara we stopped off at a few wineries wine bars and wine tasting rooms ya it was a lot of wine just saying one of which was deep sea tasting room it s located on the pier on the upper floor of one of the buildings which provides a really nice view from the pier i didn t catch the stores on the first floor but i believe they were souvenirs esque or not but anyway they were on the left side as you walked onto the pier we walked around the building on up the stairs and straight up to the bar well that s pretty much the natural flow of this spot which is nice because you can get started on the tastings without delay there s a patio deck you can sit at to enjoy the view while you also enjoy your selections we sampled a couple flights and we were enlightened on the regions the wine came from along with a brief background on wine ology not so much the scientific aspect but more so snippets of history on the travel of how the wine ended up in our glasses there were a couple very delicious pinot noirs that i enjoyed afterward we took our new found enlightenment to a couple of the other nearby wineries as recommended by the folks at deep sea which turned out to add to a really great experience cant wait to come back to santa barbara and stop back into deep sea to sit a bit longer maybe i ll make it a regular thing
1251,excellent back to original standards roti canai nasi lemak fish fried rice and golden fried squid a must all about service as well and indra is one of the best servers we have encountered on our numerous visits here as usually this is what they lack the most with rather rude and unfriendly servers
1252,visited this unique restaurant with my family and it captured the essence of a quaint cafe and espresso bar the food was outstanding served fresh hot and rapid the portions were a good size for their money i will return to cafe envie espresso bar
1253,we were walking around the french quarter looking for a cool place to eat and stumbled upon this cafe it was pretty busy when we arrived around noon and the crowd started dying down as we were finishing up 1 5 hrs later i got the oyster po boy and my girlfriend got the muffuletta the oyster po boy matched up well against the other po boys i ve tried on my vacation the muffuletta was described by our waiter as the biggest sandwich on the menu he did not lie it was pretty much what would you expect for a sandwich packed with salty meats and complimented by an olive tapenade i recommend giving the muffuletta a try if you stop by this cafe
1254,love that they have military discount thank you variety of burgers shake was good love they have coke products house ketchup was great you can have a lettuce wrapped sandwich issues sweet potato fries not cooked well enough truffle fries okay burger under cooked and asked for well done on the expensive side for what you get it will be a one time visits
1255,this was our second appointment with aptive demitrus williams was our tech he was very courteous and listened to my questions and concerns and then applied the treatments as requested he went above what my expectations for the service would be during his appt thanks demitrus
1256,i usually buy tickets in advance so i can get a good seat today i ordered two tickets for tomorrow s show and was not given the opportunity to choose a seat and they charged me a convenience fee i ve never paid a fee before and to not be able to grab seats guess i won t be doing this anymore too bad it was a nice service
1257,this was my second time visiting this location and i was more pleased this time than before i ordered a love it size half and half banana and cheesecake i was surprised that they had banana ice cream as it s one of my favorite flavors i ll be going back whenever the craving hits
1258,best breakfast sandwich i ve ever had the mrs says their chicken is waffles are top notch too
1259,excellent service and the food was delicious definitely will be going back lots of choices for our vegetarian guest too
1260,tangelo s offers good solid food for a reasonable price it s not my favorite but the staff could not have been more friendly they went above and beyond to accommodate our frankly spoiled children s additions and substitutions to each dish the restaurant is lovely we felt as if we were on vacation and who doesn t want a bit of that on a sleepy sunday afternoon give it a try
1261,there s a lot to like here not only is there a large variety of beers you can get smaller sized portions to try a lot of them they ve got a similar thing going with food as well there is a good variety of burgers and gourmet mac and cheeses and good chili but if you are hanging out with friends and having a drink there are a lot of shareable samplers for my family that counted as a good meal
1262,amazing service from the moment we walked in to to when we walked out loved the food we will be back soon super friendly staff
1263,the best chinese food i ve ever had best customer service i ve ever had too always delicious always friendly service
1264,so we went to this place for breakfast after looking for good restaurants with good breakfast and after reading the reviews we decided to give it a try well let me start by saying that the moment that you step inside you will experience a warm welcoming the place is very clean nice and cozy our server was dora and she was excellent very attentive now comes the food and i can tell you that the waffle was so delicious crispy and to top it off warm syrup we definitely are coming back to enjoy a great breakfast again
1265,let me tell you that our experience on this vacation was bad however our experience with this hotel was wonderful we arrived at 4 00 and check in was super easy everyone was very friendly and we were all set for our 3 day vacation on the way up to our stay we are from orange county we were getting calls that my husbands father wasn t doing well and they were taking him to the hospital so we were a bit stressed out but trying to enjoy our time the hotel has a great location and sitting on the balcony looking out at the beach was so peaceful it s pretty quite and the rooms are standard but very inviting parking is tight but there is plenty of street parking throughout the day we kept getting calls that his health was deteriorating and he had had a stroke and needed emergency surgery so at 11 00 pm we went to the lobby with all our bags and said we needed to check out and drive all the way back to orange county there was 0 questioning or lack of empathy johnathan who was there all day was so understanding and helpful he pointed us in all the right directions of what we needed to do to cancel our stay and was so positive it really helped to lift us up in this time they refunded our stay which was amazing because the hotel isn t cheap we would 100 stay here again and although our time got cut short we will always remember this trip the hospitality we received was unforgettable and it really goes a long way i would recommend this hotel to anyone
1266,we d been searching for just the right chairs to go with our dining table and not having much luck finding anything we liked that was reasonably priced until we stopped in at the ashley home store in edwardsville our sales rep todd shaak was very helpful and funny and made our shopping experience a pleasant one i will definitely go back again should we need any furniture in the future
1267,lazos is a great go to for delivery pizza if there was an award for speediest pizza delivery in philly they would definitely win it ingredients are fresh and they ve found the perfect balance between bread sauce cheese ratio something that can be difficult for delivery pizza creators y all know what i m talking about try it and then try not to eat the whole thing in one sitting it s that good
1268,i never give give stars but this place deserves it from the food to service and atmosphere this place nailed it tip it s busy and you will wait but the hostess said it would be about 25 minuets and our wait was 13 15 minuets they also call you on you phone when you table is ready this allows you to meander from shop to shop if you don t want to wait in the restaurant area service host was warm and friendly with all our host was rachel the waitress and food runners were delightful our waitress brie spelling was more than a waitress she was an advisor to the menu she was personable which is a talent most forget to offer within the industry food ok so now the most important part their food is absolutely amazing i had the avocado toast on sourdough it s a perfect balance of flavors texture and portion my daughter had the veggie breakfast burrito don t let the name fool you just because it s veggies doesn t mean its bland sometimes veggie only dishes lack a certain flare because they lack fats but this burrito can stand up to the most flavorful food all ingredients are fresh and the prices are just right love this place
1269,i was hesitant to try them after a bad experience in kc however my kids wanted ice cream so we got three different custom concretes and they were all so amazing i still haven t figured out the flavor of the day but i m sure with future visits i ll get it all figured out highly recommended
1270,perfect tour guide was a clear speaker knowledgeable kind and perfectly paced i thoroughly enjoyed the 2 5 hr walking tour thank you very much
1271,really nice place to go service are super nice decor inside are really modern and cool i have been there twice in 2days i really like the food there price are reasonable compare to the other expensive one i went and this place is so much easier to find highly recommended
1272,the food is 5 star i do miss the eggplant and tofu and barb b que pork dishes being dropped from the menu
1273,great sushi and prices byob is always a plus my wife loves the hot cold dessert fried ice cream highly recommend
1274,teen says food was good mom says food was ok service was average hard to find a place to park beautiful indy
1275,after looking at other reviews on yelp i had to come here i also noticed seating seemed limited but we decided to go at an off hour even then it was still busy but we managed to snag a table i will say every review that cites this place as being slow in service is spot on it is slow i don t think the kitchen is well organized to be honest and they don t encourage take out orders which is why they are always so full we ordered two lunch combos one with a figo pizza and a caprese salad the other with a margherita pizza and a caesar salad for the beverage we both got the unsweetened iced tea i wish they had better beverage options the pizzas were both amazing and perfectly balanced on par with pizzeria bianco though i say pizzeria bianco is just a little better the salads were delicious but my husband was a little off put by the piece of anchovy on top on the caesar then there was this crusty bread that was complimentary with olive oil to die for at the end of the meal we were given a tiny spoonful of the gelato i was given sweet cream my husband hazelnut we thought the gelato was delicious but quite frankly we were completely out of room i think they should lead the visit with a gelato sample or do a special with dessert or salad maybe next time overall i would say the food was excellent service was ok but slow and the prices were reasonable they do need a larger dining room with more staff and a better layout time to expand
1276,excellent breakfast fig and prosciutto toast staff is also excellent pastry s look awesome
1277,my favorite local go to place for yummy grub ants pants has not disappointed me yet food is always delicious and price is good love love their shoe string fries salads are fresh and sandwiches are fancy i give it 4 stars because they do not accept credit cards it is cash only and they do have an atm machine
1278,we love this place they always have great food and drink specials and it s always a good time
1279,i was nervous at first to go to another tailor since my own father is one and i ve used him for well 26 years now since he s in new jersey i decided to give mr lee a shot because of the reviews i needed a gown shortened within a few days and he got it done much earlier than i imagined the gown is the perfect length now his prices are very reasonable and i now have a tailor i know i can go to in indiana thank you
1280,i had a sushi burrito and i loved it i was a little nervous would the seaweed wrap be chewy would it stay together would the flavors work the sushi burrito anxiety was real and it took me awhile to try it if you feel like this don t worry it is not that scary the spot is combined with ha long bay you can actually order pho with your sushi burrito anyway if you walk into the spot side of the restaurant you will see that you order your burrito like you would a certain fast food mexican burrito first you pick burrito bowl or salad then you pick your protein you can pick two or three for a higher price then you pick sauce veggies and toppings then you watch your beauty be wrapped into a burrito i ordered a burrito with salmon and tempura shrimp i highly recommend both i then asked about the sauce and was recommended the spicy sauce since i am a heat fiend i added cucumber carrots and jalapenos i then added sesame seeds and little crunch wontons for texture some of the things that you could also add that i remember were tuna corn cilantro red onion avocado upcharge asparagus upcharge there were a lot of other choices too but that is what i can recall i grabbed a drink a container of soy and lots of napkins note grab extra burritos are a little messy if you are like me and dip in soy the first bite was magical it was super fresh delicious salty and crunchy all at once each subsequent bite just reinforced my joy i polished it off and left very happy i will definitely return soon it is a little pricey but i think that it is worth it you have to try a sushi burrito if you are a sushi fan you will love it
1281,one of my favorite spots in nashville for brunch their coffee is incredible also so many options on the menu to try will definitely have to come back to try more
1282,quincy did an excellent job grooming my standard poodle he did a great job shaping his face and removing all the mats i m so pleased with this shops wonderful customer service i will be bringing my poodle back here
1283,the sushi is decent pretty basic nothing fancy the pick 2 is a great deal if you order take out add about 20 to 30 minutes to the estimated time it s done because without fail it s never ready when we show up to pick it up
1284,this place is by far my favorite nail shop the staff is so professional great time management and the shop is so clean i wont go anywhere else again nancy did my pedicure and it was the best one ive ever had
1285,i love these guys tony is one of big help had flat tire and he got it fixed less that what his estimation expectation thank you
1286,a wonderful jazz experience just musicians and instruments playing their hearts out and sharing their passion with the audience
1287,i walked in saddened by the fact this city has no speakeasies right to the bar and said i don t like scotch but make me anything and let me tell you the bartenders are true mixologists they have kept me impressed the whole night the jazz music playing also adds to the ambiance i can t wait to come back and bring the significant other to this place
1288,best manicure i ve had in a long time they got us in quickly with outstanding service i ll be back without a doubt
1289,overall i enjoyed my last couple stays at this location the rooms are clean the bathrooms are clean and the wireless internet is fast there is also hbo and clear and direct tv stations the hotel is next to a wawa which offers 24 hour gas and made to order sandwiches most of all the hotel staff is nice and ready to answer any questions it is near highway 1 and about 5 minutes to i 95 without traffic parx casino is 3 minutes away and downtown philly is less than 30 minutes without traffic
1290,food tasted pretty good atmosphere very good but my bowl was half full and my friend s 3 tacos were tiny four of us usually go there and will be there this weekend for an event at the fox and we are deciding on dinner options before and none of them are street taco unfortunately make sure you get filled up on beer they will appreciate it because you won t get filled up on the food
1291,very good creole food large portions that taste authentic just the right amount of cajun spice incredibly quick service one group of 4 had there meals being brought to them as they were sitting down
1292,great place for brunch the staff is amazing everyone greeted us as we walked in our waiter was great he filled us in on the menus drinks the food was delicious i definitely recommend this place
1293,cool brewery with exceptional beer selection friendly helpful beertender plenty of parking their goal is to make beers they like to drink i tried several the rainbow sherbet was a beautiful color not only was it pretty but it was a really good sour to drink the 3 little birds another sour berliner weisse as also tasty the finite was a solid ipa and burkitshi was too sweet for me milk stout friendly fun loving clientele if you like beer and are in tampa angry chair should be on your must try list

1296,this is my go place i love everything it s quick easy to order prices are great and food is good steak burrito is where it s at
1297,i want to start off with food it was exceptional i had crab cakes with a half side of caesar salad i really enjoyed the atmosphere and the quaintness of the restaurant i next want to touch on the service gratuity is already included in the check which i had a hard time design with after the service i received i brought my bachelorette party to eat for brunch and one of my girls asked for jameson our waiter proceeded to tell us we don t carry ghetto drinks i was appalled he then went to see what they had and turns out the bar did have jameson he also told us he was hungover so as for the service quality i give a 1 star
1298,one of the best restaurants in the city food is consistently good try the seafood beignets can t go wrong with the hamburger steak
1299,this place is a great local comedy club they have some big names that come once in a while but also some up and coming comedians trying to catch their big break there is a 2 item minimum so if you got the tickets for free remember that you will have to buy 2 items a bit overpriced but reasonable
1300,delicious vietnamese food simple but ample menu even as a vegan i am spoilt for choice with apps and entrees my favourite is the pho very reasonable price and massive portion so much i get a to go box and have another meal at home prompt service even though the place is obviously popular so usually busy ginger tea here is really good too
1301,this is by far my favorite park to come and hike the trails with my dog on the leash the actual dog park with the off leash dogs can get a little sketchy at times most of the big dogs that are out are trained well however there s always one or two in the bunch that are a little bit too aggressive not listening to their owners for my liking if you have a smaller dog and want to go off leash i would recommend something a little more calm like the voorhees connolly park it s small but gets the job done however if you want to spend the afternoon walking around the trails jogging having a little frisbee toss and generally getting some good exercise for you and your dog this is the place
1302,had the grilled shrimp appetizer to start and we didn t finish the three of them they were over cooked and did not have good flavor got a tomato appetizer plate the was supposed to have a cajun flair to it wasn t anything special they brought bread to the table in a paper bag and it tasted like something the local grocery store would sell i got the pork chop and it was on the dry side my wife got the filet mignon and it was cooked and seasoned well although the evening only cost 100 i would not recommend this place one more note and it still bothers me days later there was like piece of paper from maybe a straw would come from on the floor close to where we were seated and numerous times the waiters and the bus persons would walk over it and not pick it up really bothered me i didn t expect such from a classy place
1303,these folks are so nice i get my shirts done here and they do a great job and are always ready they are very friendly too good old fashioned friendly customer service from a very nice family oh and they give my dog treats each time i bring him by what s not to love
1304,this ended up being our favorite restaurant during the trip we had dinner her twice since it was so good the wait staff was friendly and accommodating the food was fresh hot and seasoned well the veggies were amazing and could have been a meal themselves a great experience and will definitely come back
1305,great food staff is a gem particularly chi really took special interest in us a definite in no

1309,love this place shared the carnitas tacos and the short rib barbacoa burrito i don t even really like barbacoa but this was delicious sometimes burritos are mostly rice but they filled the burrito with a nice amount of meat along with beans get all the toppings the carnitas were so good not too fatty nicely crisped without being dry and well seasoned loved the pickled onions and cilantro staff was very friendly and efficient the decor is fun and the music is even more fun i look forward to coming back here and trying the rest of the menu
1310,great service from james replacing my windshield and tint yesterday process was easy and they came out to the house to replace my windshield james went above and beyond to make it look great

1312,fantastic tacos and salads best part of getting stranded in philly when our flight was canceled i wish there was one in vermont enjoy
1313,decided to watch the lightning hockey game at brick house first off if you are looking for a place to watch all the sports you want this is it they have tvs everywhere and a variety of seating options indoor and outdoor the bar is really nice being half indoors and half outdoors with a roof over to top off the great atmosphere our server caitlyn was just phenomenal we chose where we wanted to be seated and started off with the pretzel appetizer i am a huge sauce person loving to try all and any different sauces the photo of the pretzel shows the dips that come with it queso siracha ranch and yellow mustard our server went above and beyond giving us a variety of the other sauces they have for other menu items our entrees came out in a timely manner and was exactly what we wanted being a picky eater myself i ordered a salad and asked for a few additions which i received with no extra charge the chicken sandwich was tender and juicy and how can you go wrong with some bacon added instead of the traditional sides we chose the apple cider slaw for a little bit of health lastly we got a few togo boxes for what we didn t finish and the server brought out little togo containers with all the different sauces service and food was excellent definitely will be going back soon
1314,we stopped in on a fluke saturday afternoon we were treated to one of the best vegetarian pizzas we have ever had i would certainly go back

1320,been there a couple times to give it a chance but i probably won t be back service is awful and took 30 minutes for our food each time restaurant is always busy and has waits so i m usually patient for food but 30 minutes for breakfast food is ridiculous food is mediocre i ve gotten sick after each time eating here there s nothing special about this place,love their rum runner come visit alex and arlene behind the bar they re a great conversation can t beat their sunsets and view of the dolphins

1325,my so and i love exploring new trails and so it was no surprise when he suggested we try los padres nf once we arrive and got passed the gate we were detoured by the signs of a previous campsite i think they should just remove the signs to stop the extra stops once we got on the trail it was angelic the trail follows a stream of ponds or swimming holes we were surprised at the number of people taking the break from the summer heat but that s not why we came so on we went as we walked we found signs along the trails of balancing rocks very zen like and very comforting knowing you re on the right path the terrain varies and every turn is breadth taking definitely going back
1326,best damn breakfast i ve ever had we had the roast beef debris biscuit with cheese sauce on top and stuffed french toast the fruit was the best fruit i ve ever seen and the homemade whipped cream on the french toast was out of this world fresh squeezed orange juice and a latte for the perfect end to this meal we will be back
1327,i just found out about this place i ve been eating really bad and i was craving fruit i was told this place does fruit bowls i got the watermelon pineapple kiwi strawberry bowl they offered to put chili and lime over the top as this is how most people my husband included eat it i didn t get the chili and lime but the fruit was amazing i m such a fan i will be going back to check out what other things they offer
1328,i really enjoy this theater it is always clean and the staff is always friendly the reason i am giving them for star in that v is because they haven t done some of the necessary updates that other theaters have done by updating the seating offering wait staff service excetera you can go to the roadhouse theater for 11 with a student discount or 12 bucks which is all required liners and heated seats and they have wait staff with a chef the pricing is nearly the same at this theater but it doesn t have all the same perks i believe they may have one or two theaters with upgraded seats but they really need to go through the entire theater and update it
1329,love love love this food truck event it happens during the summer on wednesday s making the crowds minimal unlike fridays at idlewild park it s also right across the street from the truckee river so beautiful it s a great way to try supper popular food trucks without the massive lines hope it comes back in 2018
1330,went here with a some what large group the place was packed so we had to wait the host showed us a booth but recommended we wait a bit longer because the booth would not fit us comfortably we told him to give us the booth anyway the host and waiter checked up on us often to make sure we were comfortable and even though the food came out quick the manager apologized for the pizza coming out late and gave it to us as service the whole staff was extremely friendly and courteous overall had a very enjoyable experience
1331,the new outdoor experience is no joke this is exactly what the museum needed to round out their offerings so much space for kids to run and play the treehouse is a new family favorite pack the water bottle and sunscreen for the family as you won t want to miss this excited to introduce my kid to a variety of sports and help gauge interest before we sign him up for something what great exposure for kids

1337,the food here is good not great it is very busy during brunch if you arrive around 1 pm you should have no problem getting a seat in short order i ordered the monte cristo sandwich i did appreciate the french toast for the bread but the ham was a standard supermarket lunchmeat my dining partner had the breakfast sammy and was happy with his choice if you use the yelp app to secure a place in line you will check in with the hostess at the time requested and should still have another 20 minute wait not as reliable as an open table reservation but thankfully they have the option
1338,okay if you ve never tried persian food do yourself a favor and try this hidden little gem the chicken kabob is marinated in a savory mixture of spices that leaves it soooo tender and juicy the beef kabob koobideh is beautifully seasoned leaving it also so tender and juicy the doogh which is a yogurt drink with a hint of carbonation and fresh mint was one of the best i have ever had go out of your comfort zone and try the food here it is fantastic one last thing i would like to say is the owner is such a nice guy and really cares for his craft believe me it reflex s in the food five stars easily

1364,we were staying on bourbon street and passed by this place several times the balcony looked like a cool place to hang out and i love a good burger so we decided to have lunch here the balcony tables seem to be the first to fill probably because it overlooks bourbon street the hostess seated us at the last available table we got lucky the service was slow we were here well over an hour the time between getting our drinks taking our order and getting our food was pretty long even getting our check took forever but our server was very friendly it was a good thing we weren t in a hurry my husband and i ordered build your own burgers with tater tots menu stated two patties with your choice of cheese and condiments i thought that has to be huge but i didn t see a single patty option when the burger arrived i realized why it was two patties they were thin mine were very crisp as in overcooked but at least they were warm my husband s were cold the tots were ok the burger was edible but not great which was disappointing considering burger is in the name

1369,best tacos in sb front counter guy always pleasant and friendly too love this place
1370,not a vegan or a vegetarian but i love eating vegan food i was so excited to try this place out it is connected to v street which is right next door so i m guessing this is the vegan paradise of philly two awesome restaurants right next to each other so what does that mean well if you re like me that means when you are visiting the area and looking for awesome take out you just order from both places so you don t miss out we ordered take out from v street then headed next door to wiz kid where i ordered the wk philly the vegan version of a classic philly cheese steak we were originally planning on taking this to our hotel to eat the meals from both restaurants but we decided to snag a table at wiz kid and eat our food there the wk philly was ready under 10 minutes and we self sat in a cute little table where we indulged in all the vegan goodies i loved that they had regular ketchup and spicy ketchup as options i went with the spicy and my mom had the regular we split the hoagie and were both blown away by the flavor this was the best cheese steak i ve ever had the bun was so tasty the meat tasted like real meat but better because i didn t feel disgusting and overly full after i ate it due to the meat sweats and that gross greasy meat feeling in your tum the cheese was so flavorful too i honestly can t say enough about how good this sandwich was the service was great too i would come back here in a heart beat
1371,this place is wonderful i had rescued a big rottweiler pitbull mix 90lb that was not treated very well they staff and doctors are patient and go slow do to his fear and they have been able to treat him with no problem we also have a 90lb akita malumunt mix that they saved her life when she was ran over by a car all the laser therapy and herbals helped her to walk again sooner than later we love this place
1372,great food and la sey was absolutely the best perfect place to have lunch highly recommend
1373,this is what i would consider a fast paced goodwill if you don t move quickly you likely won t find much that being said i have spent many a slow evening looking through the clothing racks and scoring on items like a tory burch cardigan new kut from the kloth jeans and more but this is not the norm it is the exception thrill of the hunt the housewares furniture and shoes are pretty run of the mill i rarely find anything do not go on the weekends it is a madhouse parents do not watch their children and i don t know if the workers say anything if i could rate the finds at this store it would be 3 5 mostly mall brands huh is that a mall across the street and occasionally higher end items all in all it s a good place to hunt but don t be surprised if you leave empty handed
1374,great quick service scott is super friendly and thorough explained what he was doing and was super efficient had me in and out in 5 minutes bonus he has a friendly canine partner rocket
1375,great place just to go in and look at all the military displays store is very clean friendly personal and huge had sights changed on a m p pistol took about a half hour waited in the lounge which you can get food and drinks the gunsmiths there are the best have had several things done there never any problems great service would not let anyone else touch my guns well worth the 40 min ride would give a ten star if i could
1376,did not catch our servers name but he was amazing and made the experience that much better he reccomended the scallop and shrimp entree and to get it over pasta and it was outstanding my son ordered the kids cheeseburger i was a little disappointed because the rolls they use are plain store bought potato rolls that i buy at the supermarket all the time
1377,everything is tasty the ribs are transcendent they have never disappointed for both eat in and takeout
1378,literally the best meal i have ever eaten i was in nashville for a week for work and i went to edley s three times and got the pulled pork platter every time it s life changing my boyfriend got the hot chicken plate every time and said that was also the best he d ever had this place is unreal it s also not that expensive only about 10 platter and it comes with two sides and cornbread and if you don t like cornbread you can swap it for another side i did not love the mac and cheese but i pretty much always hate baked mac the banana pudding is bomb and the mashed potatoes are great too i really don t think you could go wrong here
1379,really good burgers and my fiancee really enjoyed the buffalo chicken sandwich the buffalo buddy french fries nice and crisp a little pricey but great atmosphere will be back
1380,venus nail is great i was looking for a new salon and googled some in my area i ve been 3 times now and they ve been amazing great atmosphere and service ask for ivy she s fantastic i told her i was going on a trip for my bday and to come up with something i walked out with this and loved it all
1381,this place is amazing delicious slushy drinks in a huge space great people watching while dulling your senses on unanticipatedly boozy sweet icy treats didn t try the gsf i shall return
1382,the beer and nachos are great here however the service that i experienced while ordering nachos on june 20 at about 4 5pm was horrible the guy taking my order at the kitchen wearing a mustache obviously hated his job i was extremely nice to him and he treated me like s this is my first time writing a yelp review and he is the reason why i would definitely go back but would not order any food if i saw him there
1383,i had never been to this library because it is a little further from where i live than another one i usually go to i was really impressed with the size layout and attractiveness of the building i came here on this day for a meeting and thankfully the person i was meeting was sitting not too far inside the door waiting for me or i might not have found her when i walked in the front door there was a rather long hallway leading to what turned out to be the main part of the library i can t say much about the layout and condition because it was under construction and they were obviously remodeling including moving the circulation desk i think and some other things we wound around a somewhat long hallway and finally came to the doorway to the actual library we found a table just inside the door and sat down unfortunately for us our meeting was during star wars week may the 4th i think and there were tons of kids and families there for a special event this made it louder and a little harder to concentrate than a library would usually be but we managed just fine and finished our meeting without interruption the bookshelves were spread pretty evenly throughout the room and seemed to be pretty well marked although i did not have a chance to browse overall this library seems very nice well laid out and complete if i am in the area and have a need to stop in a library i just might give them a try on a less busy day
1384,this small house has been turned into a beautiful restaurant and bakery if you find a parking spot you may be waiting hours in the cramped entryway for a seat but there are plenty of beautiful things to look at their cakes are beautiful but a bit on the dry side and expensive thankfully the rest of their menu is delicious especially the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant and the seasonal s mores hot chocolate cake bake is a great experience everyone should have at least once in their life time
1385,omg the mediterranean chicken quesadillas what awesome sauce definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys fresh greek food
1386,if you were expecting tiki this place is so much more pearl diver has an excellent selection of agave and sugar cane based drinks in addition to a wide selection of tiki drinks that would make their inventors proud this place has an island vibe it reminds me a lot of the broken shaker in miami beach but with a nashville twist if you live here or just in town for the weekend this is a must try don t forget the kitchen
1387,ok steakhouse as one of the review said kind of 70s inside watch out for the bench seats they have springs in them that send you across the room quality of the meat was fair but it was cooked on wood which made it very tasty straight up steak baked potato and salad i go back again
1388,best place for local produce aside from markets only place i ve found to carry sunworks meat and terra breads
1389,great coffee got a t shirt i love there too not much else to say just great coffee go ahead try it
1390,we waited an hour and a half to eat at this restaurant for a party of 3 we sat at the bar where they offered 2 for 1 drinks 2 drinks for the price of 1 what could be better towards the end of our hour and a half wait we began to get to hungry so we ordered some fries they were very yummy since eating the fries by the time we got our table and ordered a meal i wasn t very hungry so i didn t eat much of the omelette i ordered so i don t have much feedback for that
1391,best pizza in tucson amazing service great friendly staff and even better food everything s good absolutely everything on the menu is amazing this is my favorite restaurant in tucson by far it is always packed be prepared to wait but that wait is well worth it
1392,beautiful restaurant with giant aquarium you can sit right next to our server was great so helpful you should try the papa s dessert very tasty definitely recommend
1393,geat place for some awesome chinese food they were all so nice food was delicious definitely can t wait to try again
1394,what a great find we had a reservation for 6 people on easter at 6 30pm and found we wouldn t make it on time so we called to change it to 7pm they changed it for us no problem nice location downtown service was awesome and the server was very attentive and answered our many questions everyone loved their food we had the salmon ribs and 1 2 chicken they were all delicious would definitely come back when i m in the area again
1395,long overdue review sorry been so busy busy busy anyways i would like to start by telling everyone that you have to ask for gianna here gianna is super friendly and sweet i had to go to a wedding a couple of weeks ago and i really wanted to get a messy french twist going for something natural and simple i showed gianna the picture of what i was looking for i was also a little nervous that my hair might not have been long enough to do the style gianna glanced at the picture and basically said no problem it didn t take long for her to work her magic and in 15 minutes my hair looked b e a u t i f u l once she turned my chair and i saw my reflection from the front i knew the back was absolutely going to be stunning i left this salon feeling beautiful for the first time in years crazy how a simple hair style done right can change your perception of your self the salon is super cute and the owner is also very friendly and pleasant too just from one visit i can t wait for another event to use tease salon again
1396,such a wonderful hotel we booked with a new year s eve deal and ended up with a two night stay for 325 and a 100 resort credit i thought it was wonderful and although it was crowded it s definitely worth seeing during the holiday season there were a few cons everything was overpriced there are no microwaves probably so you have to buy the food and the shuttle drivers can be very rude one of the guys requires that you tip even though it is a complimentary service included in the resort fee and won t take you all the way to the destination but overall it was a wonderful stay i know a lot of people have questions about the parking it s 29 a day to self park and 39 to valet park i recommend parking in the 15 minute area to check in and then driving over to the inn at opryland to park it s free there are no hangtags or anything and there is a shuttle from the inn to the resort that is free with a room key from either place we did this and we didn t get towed or ticketed we were there for 3 days 2 nights and we saved 90 in parking fees i added a photo red is where we parked and green is where we stayed
1397,came for brunch with my dad and have been several times with friends for dinner fairly vegetarian and omnivore friendly but vegan eaters might struggle however they seemed flexible with substituting the eggs for crispy tofu in a veggie scramble on the brunch menu my dad enjoyed their take on huevos rancheros and said the chorizo was different in a good way whatever that means my friends typically get the burger rejoicing in the pub cheese the staff was great kind polite and very quick on seating overall good experience despite somewhat limited opinions for plant based eaters
1398,this review is way over due if you want your vision for you wedding to come to life use carters they have amazing customer service and true artists you can t beat their reasonable prices either
1399,okay super cool spot do yourself a favor and get the mac n cheese skillet omg amazing oh wait gravy fries too and jessie is awesome
1400,delicious breakfast and great service looking forward to going back and trying more crepes and sandwiches soon
1401,had a great time with my group at margaritaville fun for everyone drinks and food to serve all tastes and ages thank you so much valerie for your amazing service and tips yum edit we were told they let lunch goers into the friday show but this is not true just a heads up before you plan to dine before the show better to just wait in line and dine upstairs at 2 when they open it up
1402,this place had so much personality i loved the atmosphere and the spunky little quotes on the wall guacamole and frozen margaritas were both amazing the staff was genuinely very friendly i felt like we were guests in their home the menu was huge and as a vegetarian there were some good options this place is definitely a new bripp favorite i hope to return soon
1403,absolutely delicious food every time so fresh and so reasonably priced first place i come to when i come back home to new orleans love it friendly staff and awesome atmosphere
1404,i have been going here since i was in 3rd grade okay i wasn t getting my own nails done necessarily but my mom brought me with her to her regular appt and i sat and read their magazines but through those years i ve continued to visit with my mom got the occasional summer pedicure tried the gel nails occasions nails for high school dances while i was home visiting from college and now at age 24 i visit regularly for a pink white fill the owners have always treated us well and are great about scheduling out our regular appointments even when i was away at school i would only get my nails done here and i ve now moved to indy and still drive up to noblesville they do such a fantastic job
1405,they don t have a huge menu but what they have is done well and quickly the restaurant doesn t have a lot of atmosphere though and i got the distinct impressions they wanted us fed and out of there as fast as possible which in our circumstance was ok because we had somewhere to go but if you are hoping to linger over your meal this is not the place
1406,great choice of bagels and cream cheese as well as plenty of other options to add to tour bagel great deals as well
1407,this was our first visit and won t be our last we ordered an appetizer of queso with andouille sausage and it was good i would ve liked more cheese than the sausage but i think that it was a personal preference the chips were crisp and not stale and the salsa had the right amount of heat i ordered the burrito mexicana and it was delicious it came with lettuce sour cream and tomatoes and it was just the right portion it was topped with a red sauce that mixed well with the sour cream the menu was expansive they especially offered many combinations which is what my husband chose he ordered a taco enchilada rice and beans he also finished everything he got 2 margaritas and said that they tasted very good the service was also good we were seated and then greeted immediately and he checked up on us frequently i found the prices to be just a tad bit higher than other places but didn t balk since the experience was a good one
1408,i love this place i wish i lived in philly so i could visit more often they had a great selection of vintage mid century furniture at great prices someone else mentioned the prices could seem high but i personally thought they were super reasonable i d say it s worth a visit
1409,this place is a go to favorite of mine here in the neighborhood the greasy spoon of yesteryear if you will great food and conversation without the bs quick and easy
1410,very good spot i got the edamame hummus a small cup of kimchi and the hot chicken dish want to go back and try some more options but there were several other items i saw on the menu that sounded very good when i m back in town in a month i will almost certainly make an appearance
1411,another great visit to glory days as usual the food and service were awesome ask for parker and you ll be guaranteed good service
1412,great tour i would recommend doing the tour as soon as you get to the city david was a great guide who also spoke a lot about the history of the city and it s food we tasted food at 4 places and it filled us up pretty good glad we chose this tour
1413,tiffany is hands down the greatest nail tec in town she can make any of your ideas into reality she can be found hand painting 3d flowers with acrylic marbling and shes a gem diamond queen such amazing work will be back
1414,worth the wait always a line but great food sweet potato pancakes and omelet killer combo
1415,great place to bring the kids purchase farm goods and some decorations local products etc visit before another housing development crushes it love the jar goods and crunchy snacks many baked goods pick your own and activities for the kids
1416,joe does an amazing steak i ordered through ubereats the ordering process was smooth arrived on time and surprising was still hot 5 miles away my wife had a cheesesteak with fried onions and a vanilla milkshake plenty of tender ribeye fresh liscio s roll and perfectly caramelized fried onions i ordered the buffalo chicken fries and they were amazing all of the elements complimented each other highly recommended
1417,captain jason was very knowledgeable he actually lives in that area what can be better than having a true local take you around i admire his respect for the environment and the laws in certain areas there are some zones that don t allow alligator feeding other tour company s tour guides don t care about those laws and were feeding the alligators in no feeding zones
1418,this spot is different from the tired hands brewing company the fermentaria is a lot bigger and the beer kitchen menus have more variety the ipas here are great and also have some cool glasses as well came on a sunday afternoon and there was a good crowd here would recommend this place to hangout and grab a beer
1419,the reviews had me worried but despite the slightly dated exterior the room was clean and very comfortable for my family the only negative was that there wasn t a mini fridge in the room but that s not a deal breaker the man who checked us in was friendly and cordial and the process was prompt i would recommend this la quinta and would stay here again based on our current experience we might not be the pickiest customers however we expect a certain level of cleanliness from a room we will be sleeping in and this establishment did not disappoint
1420,came at worst time of day late afternoon for a few slices surprised how food they were as old as they looked but that was on me this time of day they only had plain slices and would add whatever you like got mushrooms they were canned i get it but not too far from mushroom capital if the world pizza crust was perfect thin crispy will definitely stop back in at better time for slices and would like to try other things
1421,love love love this place i have been going to lecada for almost a year for botox gina is amazing she is very honest and makes you feel comfortable during any session all the girls are so sweet and make you feel like family i have been to one other place in south tampa and was not impressed as they were in a rush to get you in and out and appeared to have given way too many units in one spot highly recommend lecada for your beauty needs
1422,great environment we ate lunch here recently my friend had a reuben and i took a bahn mi and a glass of wine both sandwiches were great and they have an extensive wine selection of interest for future dates are paired wine dinners but we are out of towners so we will have to coordinate with their schedule service was excellent
1423,gooooo eagles thank you for giving us our first superbowl with carson wentz inside the 20 he s dangerous and invincable nick foles is damaging relife with lagarret blount on the infield zack ertz te on the midfield and jay ajai on the outfield one day we might have a perfect 16 0,i m surprised at how sleep at the wheel the snyders became bobby clark destroyed our team as a gm fluxuated old flyers technique around the nhl and trapped us with nontradeables tied to long and nonbreakable contracts in fact i never seen the guy score personally our history has better emric players than that guy off with his head
1424,my girlfriend got me to go here and get a facial she kept talking about how great it was so i gave it a try well now i am hooked i see anna when i go and she is really great the place is very nice with a at home feel parking is good also two thumbs up
1425,amazing lunch burger is the best in boise fabulous prime rib sandwich and dessert everything food wise made in house great wine selection and have a 35 and under wine menu that is appreciated excellent service will definitely visit again recommend highly,we may have visited on an off day tacos and gauc were good but no comparison to funky taco 15 for a cold glass of the only cab sauv on the menu was disappointing seriously that much for a glass of wine mushroom taco that said was a mix of many mushrooms was all portobellos with one shiitake mushroom not ok great setting but need to refine quality blackened fish taco had no blackening might try again maybe
1426,i just love coming here the shoes are great local beers on tap they have wine food air conditioning why did we leave again i made a lane reservation by email on a saturday for that evening no big deal they responded quickly although they do recommend emailing for reservations the day beforehand if you want a guaranteed reservation go a little early like before 8 it got pretty busy but they did the best they could getting everyone set up to play with all the calls and walk ins those gals on the desk were mavens of organization really the tunes are pumping and quality the scoring is automatic which is great i suck at it and the feel of the place really sends you back in time the crash of the balls the pins the happy folks whether or not they are 300 bowlers heck i m happy to break 100 we always have a great time for 2 people 2 frames shoes and a beer i was too full from supper was 43 we had a ball i know they have live music from time to time and hey fred penner was there last friday i couldn t leave the house because of the air quality but they have all the feels the only negative and they can t help it is the stairs bowling alleys in basements were the norm when this one was built so stairs there are larger stalls in the washrooms though give them a call before you go if you have mobility needs and maybe there is an elevator somewhere that isn t up front this gem is our favourite in town it s close but if you plan to go in july call first as it s their low season and they might be on vacation or undergoing needed maintenance,gluten free pasta i had to try plus 1 2 price wine mon thurs did not disappoint the selection was just right we found street parking as the lot was full and at 7pm waited a bit for a table as they don t accept reservations for parties of less than 6 to start we ordered the escargot and it came from the kitchen screaming hot so hot the cheese had broken i was looking forward to the crunchy brown bits to munch on but only had a couple of small bits that survived as a celiac i couldn t dunk for the garlic butter and they didn t bring any bits for my dining companion to dunk after i had finished our server was more than helpful we could have asked but wondered if this was how it was usually served next i ordered the daily special squid mussels and shrimp with a garlic butter sauce and gluten free penne corn pasta i m not usually a fan of a single ingredient gluten free pasta corn tends to be a bit dry and fussy tonight was not much of an exception tasty oh my yes but again without gluten free bread or bun to soak up that beautiful garlic butter sauce a bit sad the seafood was cooked to perfection and i don t get to say that very often the penne well stab it with a fork and some broke in half a large spoon would have been a great addition to the dish for scooping i think i managed ok because i ate almost all of it and forgot to take pictures my dining companions all finished their meals and had desserts which looked fantastic tiramisu was beautiful and large some would share it but for others it s just right be prepared to leave by 9 30pm on a thursday as the cleaners apparently come soon after i ve never heard that before but ok not every establishment can handle gluten free ingredients or diners but they did well they weren t certain if the gelato was safe and probably cross contamination from others might be an issue so good call by our waitress i m looking forward to the single serving packages of buns from certain gluten free bakers wink wink that might make it easier for restaurants to thaw only one at a time yes you have to keep them frozen until serving they get dried out inedible and gross pre thawed i believe we will return to try more items on their menu
1427,best lil dogs just piled with chili and the finest shredded cheddar cheese chili cheese fries are also fantastic
1428,one of my favorite places to eat the food is amazing and creative even my meat loving husband enjoys the food i have never had a bad meal here my favorites are the nachos and blue lt
1429,10mix
1430,i went to the soft opening out this restaurant and have returned many times afterwards because i was so impressed during my first dining experience here the food is consistently amazing the service is perfect and the wine list is interesting as well they excel in their small plates though do try their appetizers along with your entree the pasta is made in house and their sauces are complimentary and flavorful
1431,first time at snola and i must say that the snowballs are incredible the cheesecake stuffed snowballs are quite rich but they re very good i enjoyed every second of it hope to return again soon
1432,i ve stopped here twice on a sunday for the lunch buffet i like the complimentary tea and mango lassi and the food is average however each time i ve been there a woman possibly the owner manager has been on her cell phone talking nonstop while seating people while filling water glasses and even while checking people out when leaving she can t put the phone down to greet or say thank you and the entire time we were eating she was on the phone in the back of the restaurant and wasn t very quiet in her conversation i think next time i try one of the other indian restaurants in the area
1433,absolutely breathtaking i am in love with this place it has some of the most beautiful gardens my husband and i could come here daily so beautiful can t wait to get our home and buy some beautiful plants staff was very helpful and knowledgeable beautiful place
1434,this is a great thai take out place the eating area is pretty small but it is super affordable so it is great for take out the food was really good we got a lot of different things off the menu it also fills a void in the drexel hill area recommended for sure
1435,the inside of it is very nice they have a lot of nail stations stations they also offer wine which is definitely a plus i have gotten my nails down here a couple time i normally get gel nails each time i have gotten my gel nails they were beautiful but seemed to peel after about 4 5 days 4 days after i got my nails done here my thumb nail started peel on the edges i ended up just peeling the rest off because my hair would get caught in it it has been a week all of my nail are peeling i also got a pedicure and they did a really good job i got regular polish on my toes and they still look great i am going to try them out 1 more time but will try the dip powder overall i enjoyed my experience but was not a fan of their gel polish
1436,crisp vegetables spring rolls and a sweet savoury pad thai with well executed noodles good predictable thai meal because i learned they allow byob i brought over some beers from the giant in the same shopping strip i ordered the vegetable spring rolls and shrimp pad thai the spring rolls come out hot out of the fryer they are sliced at an angle which allows more of the aroma of the filling to waft up to one s nose the crust was pleasantly golden both slightly oily and crisp the interior of the roll was slightly mushy not quite perfect but the mix of vegetables was savoury and generous in portion the accompanying sweet and sour dipping sauce added a needed element of acid to an otherwise very umami forward flavor profile the shrimp pad thai was portioned very generously the noodles were well executed firm yet soft on the bite the dish had a powerful flavor blend of fishiness savouriness and sweet the nuts inside were just crunchy enough to add an interesting mouthfeel the shrimp was slightly over cooked and presented a noticeable but subtle mushiness overall the dish was filling and more interesting in flavor than in texture which was quite homogeneous the noodles really did an excellent job absorbing the pad thai sauce
1437,one of the coolest looking bars you ll find in any town i ve been here about 6 7 times and the staff is usually great i asked a bartender to recreate a drink they had on an old menu one time and he said that he couldn t eaten here twice and was not impressed either time my social group won t eat here any more because of the food quality but i will still come by here occasionally for a drink because the bar has such a cool scene
1438,great place to go and hang out with friends my personal favorite is the chocolate martini the atmosphere is casual and fun the staff is friendly and they have a few different options for sitting outside in the nice weather
1439,we recently had an event here and it was great not only were the portions of food great the price was reasonable and the staff was amazing they helped us setup decorations and went out of their way to help us carry things in as we had a bout of bad weather d was also very communicative and flexible to some of the last minute adjustments we had to make and i would highly recommend this place for your next event
1440,marvelous one of the most unique places in indiana it s every girls dream and for all you guys treating a girl to this place she d be over the moon it s a very professional intimate atmosphere for how many people were ordering to go we received our order promptly i will say it was a bit confusing walking in the first time and figuring out how to order
1441,the original and teriyaki wings are awesome and the menu is so eclectic love it the servers are nice sometimes the wait is a little longer than i like so i recommend ordering ahead of time
1442,spent 2 nights at the peppermill while in reno on government business government rate is excellent and they don t charge the resort fee hotel is very dated and rooms are a bit gaudy but the room was comfortable and the non smoking floor did not at all smell of smoke most of the public spaces in the hotel are also relatively fresh smelling that truly shocked me given this is a smoking casino the staff are ultra friendly and helpful i asked a manager for directions and he went out of his way to walk me to my destination which was halfway across the enormous hotel complex there s a nice heated outdoor pool and hot tub although the second pool and hot tub were closed for maintenance while i was visiting one of the things i liked most and i guess this is part of the course for a casino hotel all of the shops and coffee shops in snack bars were open 24 hours if you re bringing the kids they have a nice kids arcade parking is relatively convenient check in lines were long but they have a self check in that sped things up a lot don t be mistaken internet parking is not free most travelers pay a resort fee which is another way of charging for parking and internet only major negative the neighborhood is terrible i went for a three block walk to get to a walgreens and took my life into my hands meth addicts heroin users and hookers
1443,i liked the fact that i was greeted while i entered the establishment i was really glad that part went well because i have heard mixed comments and rrviews about this spot so i was happy let me just say this happy hour is 4 to 7 and it s pretty standard my bartender was honest with me about my wait time because this place was super packed however i waited no more than five minutes for my drink i went with the standard drink that s hard to screw up the margarita lol and its really good i am impressed by the music selection all hip hop and r b which made my happy hour experience that much cooler i can see why its trendy so many people dipped in and out this spot its crazyyyy but you really cant gi wrong with good drinks and music yes you can get drinks to go here i just really enjoyed the ambiance at the bar i know i will be back
1444,my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our visit and both of us decided that this was the best total restaurant experience we have had and we are not spring chickens service and food were superb sterling was a fabulous waiter and the staff worked together smoothly the food was perfectly cooked the eggplant was outstanding and i don t usually care for eggplant the whiskey cake was the perfect finish we will definitely be back
1445,best breakfast tacos i have ever had the breakfast burger is phenomenal as well great service too awesome atmosphere
1446,overall experience was good went here after going to a few other bars loved the basketball shooting game they have as well as the outdoor fire pit the outdoor dining makes me feel like i m in my own backyard and i absolutely love it
1447,yummy yummy yummy i enjoyed my yummy rolled oreo ice cream i would definitely return and recommend
1448,the food was great service was pleasant and efficient atmosphere was nice we had a combination of things from the menu fried catfish sandwich was excellent gumbo great chicken fingers were good fried shrimp was good crab cakes and chicken and waffles got a thumbs up corn dog good everyone was happy with their menu choices and the bar drinks were good too the only problem and it s common in the area and is being worked on but parking was very difficult i m going back to try the fried chicken and cajun creole choices
1449,the depot is the hip and trendy spot you think it should be great old building and they have done an excellent job sticking to the old american feeling that belongs in this building good selection of house brewed beer great selection if you like ipa s menu is decent size but for some reason feels smaller than it is they change it often which we like and the food is always of high quality great ambiance and friendly attentive staff parking is really tough and leaves you down a block most of the time hoping your car will be safe all in all another good trip to the depot
1450,had a vegan chicken burger and it was delicious tasty with good spices small space inside and a bit crowded when you are waiting for the food but no long wait exceptionally fast and this was during lunchtime perfect if you order food to go
1451,last night my wife and i were going through the drive thru and we i forgot my wallet we didn t have enough money to get our order i spoke with a manager named marcus and he let us take our food and come back later to pay this place went beyond customer service last night and will stay my favorite hamburger spot forever thanks to all the good people who make things better at in and out
1452,i loved the honolulu roll some of the best sushi in tampa fairly priced and cute atmosphere
1453,the penang chicken with the chicken flavor infused white rice will always be one of my favorite meals wether in boston or in philly the quality is the same and i am a huge fan when we came in the line was very long but surprisingly we were sat in about 15 20 minutes the service was fast from start to finish so i didn t have to wait long before i could start eating the juicy amazing chicken i was planning on getting an order to go to drive back to virginia to eat but that seemed greedy so i didn t i regretted that decision the second i got back home so next time i will be greedy
1454,the food was very food but the service was paaaainfully slow we sat there for what must ve been 20 minutes before ordering our drinks the drinks were delivered by someone other than our server we didn t place our dinner order until i was almost done with my glass of wine food came out promptly and was delivered by someone other than our server this was at 6 30 on a tuesday and not during mardi gras or anything like that my husband and i both had filet mignon with spinach and potatoes the spinach was surprisingly delicious potatoes could ve used a little something steaks were cooked perfectly you could cut it with a butter knife so yum good experience overall but i m glad i wasn t super hungry when we got there,best dining experience i ve had in nola so far mind you it was like 3 00 on a tuesday we got the burger that has the grilled cheese in it also the sampler thingy red beans and rice jambalaya some kind of etouffe soup type thing all amazing the bacon on the burger was some frickin amazing bacon beef was cooked perfectly we also had these weird hush puppy looking things that were topped with tobacco infused powdered sugar they called it a bignet but it wasn t the kind of bignet i imagined anyway it was interesting and yummy we sat at the bar fantastic service wish i could remember the lady s name it was this week so whoever the bartender was on tuesday she provided us with some helpful tips kept our drinks full helped bag up our leftovers too great service atmosphere was good the upstairs was closed because it s winter
1455,i ve tried the tom kha tofu the pad thai tofu and the mango with sticky rice easily some of the best thai dishes i ve ever had so excited to keep coming back for more also sit outside the ambience decor is so cute
1456,update happy hour 3 5 stars i really hate to downgrade places i do genuinely like but i have to be objective i did my research on places downtown offering happy hour specials and based on what s advertised i picked tryst for a gathering of 4 we were seated promptly outside the location and the view are excellent the outside decor is cozy and elegant i asked the hostess what the happy hour specials were and she told me they don t have any i asked our waitress the same question and she pointed to the section of the menu that lists the offerings the happy hour specials before 7 pm are half off house wine some beers well liquor and appetizer specials we took advantage of the half off house wine excellent malbec the problem was with the appetizers there weren t any the menu clearly states half off appetizer specials we were told that they are in the process of changing the menu and currently there are no appetizer specials my personal belief is that if something is offered especially in writing it should be honored and delivered oh well the food it was very good i m not a fan of calamari and i would never order them after tasting my friend s calamari i did put in my own order they were that good tender and juicy the serving was very much on the small side the bison carpaccio was very good as well the house pesto underneath was absolutely delicious we also shared the pork tacos and a cuban sandwich both were decent nothing special but nonetheless good our waitress by the way was fantastic i have enjoyed her service before and she s always done a great job
1457,so i m not from the area after a long day of driving i was hoping to find a nail salon open a little later i found glossy 130 on yelp with fantastic reviews i called and they were open until 8pm on a saturday so i got there at 6 and got the deluxe pedi and a nail set my pedi was absolutely amazing and my nails look great i highly recommend this spot and when i m back in town again it will be my go to destination get the deluxe pedi it s a decent price and it s well worth it i don t remember the girls names who did my nails but every guest in there were leaving happy including me all of the staff are very friendly and this location is very very clean
1458,love the smells of chocolates here as you walk in the door amazing and creative chocolate team here that can create just about anything out of chocolate icing nuts dried fruit what we love gourmet chocolate dipped pretzel rods mint meltaways dark and milk chocolate chocolate covered orange peels bourbon chocolates also a great place to find or special order your favorite candies lastly i ve got to mention the treats they put together for special events and holidays
1459,this was my first time at this restaurant the restaurant is very clean very courteous polite and friendly staff and the food was excellent i d highly recommend the trout and eggs it was delicious i ll definitely return many times to this restaurant
1460,my first visit here and was pleasantly surprised how fresh and artistically displayed each dish was good value as well
1461,this place is an amazing piece of history it was great to stay the night here we got one of the upgraded suites with free breakfast and everything was amazing the rooms were so beautiful and all of the historic features were amazing
1462,you can tell that they really care about how the food comes out food was amazing and seriously cooked to perfection delivery was fast and he was friendly and the food was hot i will be ordering from them from now on 9 15 18 ordered from here again fast delivery very nice delivery guy ordering online was a bit finicky but food came quick and is amazing once more
1463,i like my pie better this seemed to chaotic and didn t have pies home made giant meatballs didn t give any plates and no place to throw away your mess one trash by door but it said recycle i don t know if it was the red sauce but it was very salty
1464,i hadn t been to luke in many years so the other night a friend was staying at a hotel nearby and i suggested we go to luke for dinner i was disappointed that they only had one of the five selections of oysters however we enjoyed some tasty p j s oysters as an appetizer we moved on to order the shrimp and crawfish etouffee and the crispy brussels sprouts the etouffee was excellent not too spicy on the cajun side and just right on the creole i look forward to exploring more of their menu soon,the staff is amazing for so many reasons i can t even begin to explain coldest day of the year so far and they invited me in and helped me out in the most ridiculous of circumstances the food the donuts just stop right at the beignet and cafe au lait donut it s the only one i need i don t even like beignets all the much i grew up here i only go to cdm when friends are in town but put coffee creamy pudding inside a donut and that s my jam errr coffee and puddin and donut the only thing that could make it better is if the pudding had liquor in it pudding shots yessss
1465,very cute french style market and restaurant 3 different ordering areas brunch breakfast sandwiches hot food and salads wine beer cooler area as well great options at all ordering areas and very stylish decor very posh place wine on draft and fros brunch was very tasty as well enjoyed the b e l t and breakfast sandwich cheese grits were so cheesy and delicious all staff were very helpful and friendly the pastry items also looked divine but we were too full to indulge they will validate your parking garage ticket for 1 hour as well they also have a lot of local items for sale seasonings drinks mixes jams jellies and sauces that would make a great gift basket you can dine in or order to go and i even plan on bringing my hubs here to get some yummy snacks to take on a picnic at centennial park when the weather is warmer
1466,we stopped in here before we headed to mardi gras parades the restaurant was surprisingly empty which was lucky for us the service was fast and friendly especially considering the parades were right outside their doors the food was very good the corn bisque was soooo good you could tell that the food was fresh and not a pre made pour it into the fryer type meal everything was very clean which is again impressive during mardi gras we were all very pleasantly surprised and will definitely go back next time we are in the area
1467,so glad to find authentic vietnamese sandwiches in boise what a treat came in and got 2 bbq pork bahn mi s 4 egg rolls and 2 bobas 1 milk tea and 1 thai tea everything was so delicious the bbq pork was flavorful and thin cut so it was easy to chew and eat the vegetables were super fresh and crunchy made for a great contrast to the delicious fresh baked bread i m not even really a bread person but i loved this long baugette it was crispy and soft at the same time the egg rolls were filled with pork and very flavorful as well and they were a great deal at 1 a piece they re large we didn t need 4 last but not least the milk tea oh the delicious milk tea it was one of the best i ve ever had and i ve had a lot of them in orange county california where they have an entire vietnamese square mile this holds up with those i am really looking forward to coming back
1468,we went to chick fil a last night for valentine s day they did a reservation dinner it was 20 for two people and that included an entree 2 sides a drink and dessert plus you had a server each table had a goody bag with some chocolate and a mini moo in it they also had a photo booth and a group of gentlemen singing it was a super cute date night with our 8 month old son i hope they do more events like this
1469,late night drive thru people are the best here only one i trust to make good food late at night consistently younger guy and older woman both great workers and glad to have them there i just wish the cookies were 3 for 1 like other mcdonald s so i don t have to drive further
1470,overall a well done place imo food has been good both times atmosphere is trendy and has all the usual offerings these types of places thrive on craft beers and specialty diet standard options etc basically if you have a millennial with a beard and love selfies on instagram this is your heaven on earth
1471,sinfully delicious offering everything from mini bundt lettes to full bundt cakes this place will kill your diet and feed your inner child with icing laced confectionary goodness my mouth salivates when i think about it nice selection of flavors that change by the season the only thing i don t like is the fact that they make you remain on their mailing list to get your free birthday bundtlette they tend to over email you so i cancelled the email subscription and found out that i was not eligible to have my birthday bundt anymore even though i come quite often a bit pricey but with the extra dough
1472,had my side and rear windows tinted with their top product there was a big sign in the waiting room that said there is no perfect job well as far as i can tell there is and i got it they took the time to explain the options and let me see it on their own cars it took less time than then stated which was a good thing i was very cautious not to roll down the windows for the first week and have had no issues highly recommended very professional
1473,payette brewing when my family says we re going to payette i get exited there it s like a family party because you know at least one person there and with friendly staff you have a good time when you go there you feel comfortable and free one thing i could change would be the food they had it was ok the food truck only had salads and wraps which i am ok with salads but not my first pick
1474,hands down the best frozen custard ever this place is one of the biggest reasons i chose for moving into the neighborhood whether your local or in town for a visit ted drewes is a must
1475,very good authentic mexican food i had a chicken burrito i was very flavorful and large portion i could barely eat it all but i did my wife had a chimichanga it was was very big and was very tasty very much larger than you ll get anywhere else she could not finish it my son had the same thing as wife he said it was great but finished it grandpa had taco very flavorful and enjoyed it defiently would go back great value for the price
1476,i will start off with the reason for 4 stars and that s due to price i think it s a little overpriced for a metairie steakhouse we sat in the bar seating and it was a nice ambiance our waiter was jenna and she was incredible if you do decide to dine please ask for her even if you have to sit in the bar area they do have booths if you re a booth type of person she really made our experience there worth the money we had the tuna pok which i thought was delicious higher price than most restaurants we had the french onion soup that was really good crazy overpriced i had a filet which was cooked perfectly i also ordered the brussels sprouts wouldn t do that again they were meh my husband had the prime rib which was incredibly tender but lacked some flavor the creamed spinach was delicious we also had the chocolate molten lava cake and it was sooooo good overall service was impeccable if we went back i would definitely ask for jenna i don t think i will be back often as the price is to high compared to other locally owned steak restaurants we enjoy
1477,wow this might be my fave restaurant in all of nashville i will be back next time i m in town
1478,the food was delicious the staff was friendly the tacos were to die for i can t say anything bad about this place the atmosphere was great i would highly recommend this place to anyone
1479,great jazz sunday brunch the food is excellent and the 3 instrument floating jazz band is awesome the band is comprised of 3 older gentlemen who are fun talented play an assortment of tunes we had 2 cappuccinos and split a muffuletta and the bread pudding both were delicious the only reason i gave it 4 out of 5 stars is the price 22 for a muffuletta half the size of the one at central grocery but then again you re paying for the ambience as well overall a great experience
1480,today was my first ride and i have to say i was a little nervous and intimidated to even go but i had such a great experience the front desk was super friendly and helpful along with the staff inside who helped me set up my bike alexis the instructor was so full of positivity the music was great and the workout was amazing now i know why people shell out the money to go bonus bottle of water and shoes are free your first time i can t wait to go back for another ride
1481,terry is the real mvp me and a couple friends came in searching for our friend girl was a little drunk after failing to find her terry asked what she looked like and said he d keep an eye out after about 10 minutes of trying to call this chick she answers her phone or terry does either way point of the story is terry brought us our drunk friend back to us safely something that is definitely not in his job description give this guy a gold star and a raise
1482,the service was only beaten by the food atmosphere was great this made my trip to new orleans it s like walking into a fancy restaurant from the 40 s richie rich defines good service thanks
1483,amazing food and staff here i went here a few days ago while on vacation and man i want to go back it was so good if you don t know what to get share the red neck nachos with the table and the bucket of champagne chicken oh my wows you ll be in a food coma for sure but they are so good
1484,enjoy the food and atmosphere great place to chill and watch some sports or just catch up with some friends low key environment with friendly staff
1485,i always find the burgers fries and shakes to be as appetizing as expected from a burger joint and throw in the fact that most of the ingredients are natural organic makes it a much less guilty pleasure but the place needs a manager since on most occasions it s all teenagers and as much as they try to do their best someone needs to be there to keep the place organized far too often the cashier has to make the milkshakes which tends to cause the line to order increase and let s face it most teenagers aren t the speediest workers when left alone i feel like the owner is probably just cheap and tries to get by without it which is probably why there is always a huge turnover rate and the help wanted sign is permanently in the window my advice is don t come during dinner time and also when you get your fries immediately uncover them since it tends to steam them which is what makes them super soggy
1486,my friends had to come looking for me in this store because i was stuck in the whiskey section marveling over their selection i didn t even make it past to the other parts of the store they had an extensive selection of brown spirits being a whiskey drinker i was in heaven staff are super knowledgeable and helpful would have loved to have spent more time exploring but my bank account is probably grateful i didn t as it was i purchased a bottle of chicken cock and a bottle of willetts and i was a happy woman
1487,love love love dutch bros favorite coffee house they never mess up on my drinks super friendly fun experience this location can get tight sometimes with the drive through but worth the wait
1488,wonderful experience a busy saturday night for this spot and yet it felt like a cozy comfortable dinner at a friends place we ordered the chef tasting menu and had our wines paired by our server and i m glad we did because we both thoroughly enjoyed each dish i feel that the attention we received from our server is the reason our meal and experience was spot on he listened to our needs and asked us questions to find out what we didn t like no surprises here just delicious food and superb wine you won t be disappointed
1489,cute love the place finger food and tea was great service maybe could have improved when coming to reservations but we had a good time
1490,over priced and food is salty nice ambience can we make the patio dog friendly kind of tight in there very loud as well clever menu items could be executed better
1491,love this place best kept secret in creve couer 9 hole course affordable staff is helpful
1492,hands down my favorite restaurant in nashville the menu is always changing so there is always something new to try every time i come back not only are the dishes unique and intriguing but they are executed perfectly every time i ve brought so many guests here when they come to visit and everyone always raves about it we always include an order of whipped feta with our meal which never disappoints the service can be a bit hit or miss at times but even still the food makes up for it if you re visiting nashville i recommend trying this place out instead of some of the other more popular tourist spots if you live in nashville and haven t yet come here then make a reservation and try it out soon,edley s is my go to spot i always recommend it to visitors and i take my own guests here all the time for a casual meal every time by the end of the trip people always tell me that it was their favorite meal of the weekend even when we hit up a lot of nashville s fancier spots the grits casserole and the potato salad are my favorite sides be prepared for there to be a line to order and be prepared for them to be out of brisket if it s long after lunch hours still it s worth it
1493,the next day we had burgers at tavern we really enjoyed the house cheese burger cooked medium rare just as ordered flavor filled and juicy the fish tacos were good but lacking somewhat in flavor we has a draft blackstone fancy boy and a draft muchaco good service also
1494,i have been a patient of dr sande and richard mccracken for about a year and half the office staff has always been very pleasant and efficient the physicians are well educated and have been very accommodating also having the endoscopy center on site is quite convenient i highly recommend them
1495,everything we ordered was so good and fulfilling i came from baton rouge just for morrows i will definitely be back
1496,we ve lived in this area for 15 years and never made it here for some reason a birthday pak arrived in the mail and offered a discount so we figured we d finally give it a try we arrived during happy hour and had 1 2 price drinks and a french fry with cheese app my wife was more of a fan than i i thought the fries were a bit on the dark side we were seated in the main dining room just off the bar area and the live music was still quite loud we both enjoyed the house chips when most other restaurants that we d been to offered these they would be poor these had a nice taste with a dipping sauce that made them even better my wife had the crab cakes and liked them i had the filet with the mashed potatoes and it was done exactly as requested and was a solid piece of meat with no waste and had very good flavor we could see that other patrons had ordered sandwiches and they looked fairly large we will plan on coming back and the next time we will stop for lunch
1497,this place is ok really not sure why it was voted best tacos in the area i appreciated the free chips with my order and the fish taco was good too
1498,cafe envie was an amazing cafe to visit while in nola the espresso my sister got and the warm coffee i got was amazing the food selections were amazing thank you cafe envie
1499,i was staying at the hotel monaco and didnt feel like walking in the rain so i grabbed a spot at the bar and ordered the soup of the day tomato which came with grilled cheese the food was just ok edible but not very flavorful the soup was bland and had a weird pulp texture and the grilled cheese was overshadowed by 2 giant pieces of bread service was excellent though but next time i d try some other spot
1500,gus is the best his commitment to quality ingredients and preparation details are inspiring unfortunately i got my platter today and had no falafel from a falafel truck so after browsing yelp i learned that his fryer broke and the cost is too high to fix i started a gofundme to see if we can raise the 3k to bring back falafel it s under falafel fryer for gus https www gofundme com falafel fryer for gus
1501,we live just 1 1 2 short blocks from this little place and so far we have been to eat there 3 times with great results the menu is interesting and varied with some interesting indian dishes as well as some fantastic breakfast delights the eggs benedict is delicious with excellent holandaise and smoked salmon the omlettes are well crafted with flavourful ingredients to choose from there are some tasty creative sweet waffle breakfasts to choose from as well the service is attentive friendly and most welcoming we are happy to have this place open so close to us with so mant tasty menu items we look forward to exploring more items in the menu best wishes for nalaz
1502,was traveling through tucson and came here for dinner with friends fun atmosphere tv s showing pac12 basketball yay highlights of food we ordered smoked french bread pizza different and tasty and cesaer salad used whole romaine lettuce made good finger food way to eat salad beers on tap were good too
1503,limited menu but very good food the owner is delightful
1504,long wait but worth it i had home fries french toast with banana filling and bacon with a ice coffee
1505,whipped feta was great disappointed in the lack of flexibility at this restaurant eggs are served soft only and chef not open requests restaurant is also unable to split bills transactions
1506,very good mexican food the nachos were a little salty but we devoured them still the mahi mahi tacos and the avocado tacos were amazing i think i preferred the avo tacos over the fish it was a rather long wait so we put our names in grabbed a drink at another bar and checked out the famous wings on 11th street was very happy we didn t eat someplace else
1507,rock bottom has changed it s name to better fit their aspirations and goals heroes dive center owned and operated by 21 year army veteran shawn carroll and his business partner john catalano with emphasis on making diving accessible to all an the share in the adventure please come in and visit and see why you would want to learn how to or expand your diving adventures with the team at heroes dive center
1508,this was my second time eating here since i ve moved to new orleans today i got french toast with bananas a side of grits instead of the choice of meat my boyfriend ordered a shrimp poboy we sat outside were immediately acknowledged by the waitress the busboy we waited a few minutes before we were given menus our waitress took our drink order after we ordered it took about 15 mins for our food to arrive we didn t mind the wait as it was a nice day out for a sweet tea our food the bill was 24 07 it was a nice treat we were lucky there wasn t a line like usual
1509,josh was our server and he was awesome thanks for the great food and friendly service steak was awesome i had the grouper blackened and it was delicious
1510,went there for the first time and it was really good yummy is all i can say and it was hard to pick what to eat because they had so many choices and they all looked tasty
1511,always good food great views and a relaxed environment definitely worth the wait when they re busy and by far the best burger in carpinteria
1512,if you looking for crabs legs this is the best place to eat them i see people complain about the prices but this place is worth it we drive from st amant la monthly for this wonderful seafood
1513,consistently decent customer service i ve seen it get rowdy in there with the penn crowd and staff handles themselves with finesse as always great ice cream
1514,nice authentic mexican we went for lunch and it was not busy as all ordered an enchilada and the skirt steak started with the table side guacamole the pomegranate margaritas are yummmmmyyy
1515,came here for some afternoon drinks bartender antony is the perfect combination of knowledgeable and down to earth beautiful ambiance and aesthetic
1516,have no complaints i was seated quickly the waitress was very friendly very patient and very knowledgeable about the menu she was very attentive and i can t remember her name i do remember she was almond toned with a short cut with like a red tone to it the total bill had me like wait a minute these prices but all in all it was a good experience would i go back definitely i had the ultimate satisfaction burger which was insaneeee it was grilled cheese sandwich with bacon in the middle of a burger side note the bathrooms were clean which is a for me
1517,i saw mr ice cream while on a previous trip and wanted to try out this new roll craze but wasn t able to make it in our group of four was definitely impressed with the choices and the show they put on while making the ice cream the fact that they offer all the topping options is a definite bonus pricing at 6 50 is reasonable for the serving size better than weigh your own froyo if the pics on yelp don t amaze you stop in and try it and you ll leave very happy
1518,stopped in here after reading the other yelp reviews despite thoughts it would be a tourist trap we went for breakfast rather than middle of the night drunk food post bar hopping down broadway we arrived around 0930 on a weekday and it was packed but we found the last 2 available seats it s an interesting setup with the 3 sections it s divided into i got the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend got the short rib hash i was skeptical about the gravy with syrup on the waffle but i went for it anyway i was mostly impressed the chicken and gravy needed a fair amount of salt pepper but the waffle was hot and not soggy i asked for a little side of gravy because i felt like it didn t come with enough our waitress brought me a bowl and then promptly charged me 2 50 extra for it i could ve done without if i had known it was going to be that much you re already paying tourist prices so careful there my boyfriend said the short rib hash was good but there seemed to be more onions in it than actual hashbrowns the service was good they have the diner working like a well oiled machine and the head cook definitely keeps an eye on his plates he s making to ensure they get out to the customer asap the atmosphere is great if you like 1950s 60s era music and a true diner like atmosphere i ll likely go back on my next trip to nashville
1519,dumpster delivered when requested customer service was very informative and easy to deal with on the phone
1520,what can i say i had a table full of toddlers and lyndel took really good care of us she was attentive quick and super sweet i would give her 10 stars if i could our order was right and she was awesome and personable she rocks
1521,mr b s is not like your favorite outfit too many selfies in the same outfit and it starts to lose its luster one can go to this spot every day of a new orleans visit and enjoy it time after time two things give this gem away 1 the place is constantly packed with locals folks who can enjoy world class dining any night of the week 2 for at least 2 decades its been a perennial let s start with the french bread and butter at each table it is heavenly say yes to the fried green tomatoes for a culinary history lesson the gumbo ya ya is assertive thick and dark with every ingredient calling attention to its own importance whichever salad with fruit go for it the first salad i had featured strawberries and i was hooked the latest featured poached pears and it made me make reservations for the very next day if fruit isn t your thing the royal is delicious too good lord the shrimp and grits the barbecue shrimp is a bit of an improvisation it may be a bit too foufou for the recipe purist the shrimp with angel hair pasta is not of the slap your mama variety it s the only thing on the menu i wouldn t order again only because everlasting is so much better the bread pudding transcends everything go enjoy the hospitality the gracious staff and the capable staff so worth it,so if you re going go early nothing like going to a breakfast place and being in line to order as they flip the kitchen to the afternoon menu but i get it the sliders are great and the waffle fries are a must if you must have a breakfast offering at an odd hour go for the croque madame pork eggs havarti and bchamel sandwiched between two donuts oh my more than anything else go to the district for strong coffee and atmosphere it s an eclectic group of hard scrabbled staffers locals tourists and the partygoers you saw wearing the same clothing as the the night before people watching is a form of entertainment itself and this is the place
1522,i used to come here a lot while in reno for business shortly after it opened then my career took me to other places we re here for a long weekend if relaxation had to come back to brew bros for old time sakes the ipa was very disappointing it had minimal taste seemed flat just not good either they ve tamed the recipe so beer minions that like tasteless stuff will be happy or the lines are dirty need to be cleaned thank goodness they have a good whiskey selection so the evening wasn t a loss now to the food we decided on appetizers instead of meals the chicken wings were very small but cooked a little extra as i asked were really yummy the basalmic brussels sprouts were a total hit i d definitely order those little heads of vegetable heaven again the burnt ends were meh way too fatty overall it was ok nothing special nothing too horrible until we came back later after some gambling drinking needing something to soak up some booze we ordered garlic parmesan fries thinking they would be just what is needed how disappointing the basket of out of the bag frozen fries were even ore ida frozen fries which are horrible would have been better the garlic parmesan what little there was wouldn t even stick to the aweful undercooked over starchy excuse for fries the bartender said they used to be awesome but management recently changed them that every customer says they are no good now i say they suck should be taken off the menu other than that it was a solid 2 1 2 experience
1523,we stopped here after a long day at the zoo the burgers were fresh and juicy my daughter s hot dog was big and delicious as well good fries and my soup was great as well the service was on point some of the best we ve ever had prices are very reasonable i just can t find enough good things to say about his experience
1524,my husband and i swung by this little cafe and was greeted by the sweetest man ever the cafe is very tiny but super cozy and lovely we ordered a baklava to share and it was delicious planning to come back next time for lunch
1525,what an amazing find i flew in to tucson too late to catch breakfast here so we settled on lunch some of the best food i ve ever had fresh delicious great prices and the best service
1526,my work had a staff appreciation week party of about 40 employees the facility is clean tables and chairs are plentiful and comfortable the lanes and seating are nicely set up lanes are well cared for we had pizza which was new york style and very delicious the staff was courteous and attentive
1527,i walked in with only half an hour left in the night and needed to get my nails and toes done not my best move i was really apologetic to the lady at the front but she got me in with nini and boy did she take care of me the shop is really nice they serve wine and really care about their clients that will now be my go to shop
1528,this place was nice clean and bright it s your typical serve yourself fro yo bar with several choices for frozen yogurt and a topping station the cashier was very berry nice and let me pay via credit card even though i was a few cents short of the minimum i d say my son enjoyed his time here
1529,ok food that is mostly too sweet did not want to try the sushi on our first try so we can t comment on that we tried their teryaki and it was ok but not outstanding they ruin it by using a very runny too sweet sauce but the portions are quite generous the salad and soup that came with the meal were very basic unapitizing without flavor the sweetness of the food using perhaps unusually a lot of sugar stood out for us very unusual
1530,what else could you want great service strong pours and average food we ll be back
1531,my daughter recommended we go here and after sitting there for a few minutes i figured out why there are 3 gyms in the area including a rock climbing gym let s just say she was busy and distracted but hey at least she wasn t on her phone one of my biggest pet peeves is not being able to park there is a nice big parking lot across the street that is free for the first 75 minutes you must order at a counter which isn t bad i suppose but the prices reflect someone to serve you they let you pick out your own emoji table marker so they know where to bring the food i thought that was kind of fun a new way to express yourself at a breakfast joint i totally missed the build your own hash not sure how it is front and center i think it is trying to choose something reading off a big sign as you approach the counter i was only looking under the board entitled breakfast not good under pressure maybe i ordered a very simple breakfast called the patrol combo 2 eggs bacon garlic roasted potatoes they only had one type of bread sour dough which i thought was strange it wasn t even 10 am on a thursday i read on another review they were out of bread so common theme all in all it was very standard one thing i noted is the bacon looked way too crispy over cooked but it really wasn t it was really good another is the attention to detail like adding the chives for decoration on the eggs i thought that was a nice touch my daughter had the eggs benedict which she finished before i really even saw it she said it was good i would like to go back and try the build your own hash i think that is where the 5 stars lie i would also recommend going on a weekday so you don t have to wait in a long line
1532,our hotel recommended this restaurant 1 of the 4 had the seafood buffet it was plentiful with all the seafood you could want on a saturday the buffet is 39 95 defiantly worth it as they even had raw oysters catfish platter was good with dirty rice husband and i split a pound of boiled shrimp with corn and potatoes unfortunately the shrimp was over cooked it was good priced,waffle house never disappoints the service was friendly with a smile and the food was good we got in and out quick so we could head down to bourbon street
1533,my family and i first tried a duck donuts near williamsburg va and i had been fervently hoping one would open closer to home it did all of the donuts i have tried have been good but for me nothing can compare to the maple glazed it just has the absolute best flavor imaginable it is good with the salted caramel drizzle they also have it with bacon which i am not into i don t like bacon with sweet things but it is popular having had these donuts several times now i will never again have a donut that is not made to order i used to make donuts at home sometimes because hot and fresh is so much better but it was time consuming and messy now i can come here and have incredibly good hot customized donuts in their very pleasant atmosphere with exceptionally polite staff this is a great improvement to the area
1534,modern laundry indeed this is the nicest laundromat i ve ever been in very clean and super helpful staff
1535,i was not sure what to expect from a restaurant in a plaza but as soon as you walk in you forget you are in brandon it is so beautifully decorated and the music is wonderful the food came quickly it was delicious and we got free soup and spring rolls with our lunch we ordered two meals and our total was under 20 the service was great as well never had to ask for a refill or anything can t wait to eat the leftovers and go again to try other dishes
1536,this was our first time in new orleans and this tour was pretty fun randy made it fun and he was very informative we learned a lot in the two hours with him thank you randy
1537,wow what a beautiful building and the decor was very tasteful very comfortable relaxing and romantic space nice job the food is fabulous crab cakes and the kfc you gotta try brittany was our server she was wonderful knew the menu and knows how to help with suggestions her recommendation were spot on great job i ll be back
1538,food is amazing great quality good service lovely atmosphere i was hesitant to come because it s a little pricey but portions are good and the food is worth it i had the sausage pizza and toasted ravioli they have a weekend brunch that i m going to try next
1539,we came in for a large group dinner during our convention mr bubba and charlie took such good care of us the dinners were all so good we got tri tip rotisserie and tacos the mahi special is highly recommended thank you guys
1540,turkey club was excellent quaint good service just across from the beaches check it out big menu recommended
1541,amazing dr after he understood the type of activity allstar cheer is he was helpful in helping my 10 year old understand the need to heal before she is released back on the mat
1542,we had a great experience here recently and very much recommended this for others first the service was great robin our waitress was great timely with attending to us without being overbearing had no issue with the additional questions requests thank you robin you rock drinks were also very good i had a great whiskey sour that was spruced up with some syrah and egg white the dinner was good not great but certainly a fine experience i recommend the salmon burger my only comment would be that they might need to look at adding 1 more vegan item to the menu will definitely be back
1543,food and atmosphere is nice as one should expect in the cbd sometimes the back room can be stuffy on a busy day i recommend the raw oysters and burgers a few dollars on the high side for lunch
1544,amazing store the owner is so kind and definitely goes out of her way to not only make sure you find what you re looking for but also gives great advice on how to spend your vacation probably one of the best experiences i ve had at a souvenir store also prices are great
1545,so i go to a pancake house and order an omelette first let s back up this place is all the rave over nashville it was hyped so i was hyped the line stretched a half block but moved quickly we were seated in about 30 mins the place is nostalgic with simple german style decor the staff uber friendly they had over 21 different pancakes to choose from but none gluten free so the disappointment sat in i was already swollen from running 1 2 marathon in nashville so i couldn t add insult to injury by eating a gluten filled pancake thus my review is on their omelette not their famous pancakes i ordered the make your own omelette with five ingredients onions bacon sausage jalapeos and goat cheese it came out deconstructed i didn t expect a deconstructed omelette the eggs were neatly folded underneath the strips of bacon broken sausage patty onions jalapeos and goat cheese it was tasty but not at all a traditional omelette so note to self when going to a pancake place order pancakes or don t go
1546,solid doener box with fries and fresh cabbage and veggie on the side to add that perfect crunch i will definitely be back to sample other menu items
1547,this is our favorite go to date night location we tell all of our friends about hidden river love the beer farm to table food options and atmosphere staff is always so nice and helpful we ve been here for drinks on the deck dinner and the ghost tours can t wait until the warmer weather really hits and we can lounge outside you guys are awesome
1548,ordered from uber eats it was delivered hot all 5 stars could go to the macaroni and cheese it was that good but i also have to give a shout out to the amazing meatballs everything we ate here was pretty delicious i ll be coming back for sure
1549,probably one of my favorite places to go the appetizers are amazing would recommend getting the brussels sprouts the fish tacos the pretzels the beer is amazing always taste so fresh i ve tried every beer they brew and not one of them i didn t like
1550,i cannot day enough good things about this place i have been to various markets all around the world and mazzaro s falls in my top 3 the prices are ridiculously inexpensive and everything tastes amazing it s hard to rope yourself in from not buying everything the bakery cookies are fresh and different from others in the area and the meal options such as anti pasta or even the veal park taste just like your grandma made it aces and a must visit if you are visiting in town
1551,this restaurant should have a five star rating not only because of it s atmosphere but because of it s cuisine and wine list we have been here 3 times and every time it seems to get better this is a place you must visit when you come to new orleans
1552,sat at the bar great service great burger and my wife loved the mediterranean salmon salad i had the classic burger hold the tomato and onion but please give me some pickles i didn t get the pickles so i had to ask again then you charged me 25 cents for the 5 little pickles you gave me we spent over 50 with drinks and tip you really want to jeopardize how i feel about going there again by charging me for pickles
1553,fantastic outdoor dining in montecito the patio is amazing service was great menu phenomenal
1554,this is going to be such a great memory of florida the ride over to the island with the crew was amazing their hospitality truly shows how much they love what they do the island is a beautiful place and we re lucky to have experienced it
1555,after reading positive reviews we decided to try it we loved the food great flavors i had the seafood tacos which were better than any i have tried in the reno area husband had chile verde loved it small location with very personable staff we will return even tho it is a drive from south reno
1556,i ordered from here through grubhub and i m incredibly impressed a four meat platter with two sides for 20 is a steal the brisket and pulled pork were excellent the sauce is served on the side so you get to taste the calories of the meat and not have it masked by sauce i ll definitely hit this place again when i m in the area
1557,yes just yes 2nd best shrimp and grits in the city that boudin biscuit is to die for
1558,had a good time and lots of laughs the overpriced alcohol and appetizers were meh
1559,great beer selection park paradise is a delicious pilsner gose blueberry lemon is my fav
1560,lovely cheerful decor with outside patio seating and a cool looking gaming area high tables with stools on edges and tables and regular height chairs in center beautiful aqua blue ceiling there are many large tv s for watching sports friendly and efficient staff party of 8 all food remembered and we ll served food was delicious and fresh made the bowls with grains we re huge and the fish tacos yummy the mango salsa was fresh and mouth wateringly good,funky hippie deli in converted grease money garage with spray painted decided and the garage hoses still hanging from the ceiling cool looking couches and live music at lunch the day we were there a single acoustic guitar and singer food was fresh and made to order people nice and the place was hoping went with party of six and there was a line to order and we were fed quickly tuna salads were delicious strawberry fields salad was beautiful and fresh the sandwiches were huge most everyone took 1 2 their food home for a second meal the only down side they don t have air conditioning so it was hot
1561,we ordered the eggs dauphine and oysters benedict and grits etouffe wow everything was amazing it s a great place for everyone to order something different and let everyone try i drank a blanche devereaux so if you re a golden girls fan this is a must service was great too
1562,best tacos in tucson hands down if i want tacos i must go here they just opened another location in the park place mall and i love it worth the money
1563,i ve gone here multiple times and have consistently had good food and service food cooked perfectly every time i took a foodie friend from san fran nob hill here and he loved it the scallop sashimi is one of the most amazing apps ever nice selection of wine and drinks as a local i m very familiar with the food at all of the restaurants mentioned in other reviews this restaurant is on par with them and in some aspects better ambience here is hard to beat not sure why some reviews here are so harsh and critical maybe it s just because b g is the new guy in town whatever i really like this place
1564,awesome atmosphere and phenomenal barbers i have known these guys for awhile and i m excited to see them in a new location
1565,some very unique flavor profiles that you might not think would pair nicely but create a harmonious symphony in your mouth where each instrument or flavor note shines beautifully literally almost brought me to tears it was so overwhelming after trying 4 things on the menu everything was delicious it s a nice place you can come back to and order something different every time and be satisfied so wonderful
1566,been waiting over 30 min for my food workers joking around and telling me it s coming up but unless it is stellar i won t be back as it turns out after 40 min they realized their mistake refunded my money and fed me for free food filled me up and was tasty but nothing special nice people though
1567,saturday afternoon and i need a key copied and i see this place all the time went in and this place is serious keys everywhere they served me right away and literally cut my key in flash fast and friendly with a big smile i also notice they do out calls that will come in handy
1568,hidden gem friendly service and good food the banh cuon was very good it reminded me of california
1569,friday night staff was friendly they have all your basics plus hotdogs funnel cake and churros price was right
1570,wow very friendly staff the clam chowder was wonderful and so were the crab cakes
1571,simply my favorite food in tucson i ve had a number of dishes that have been good to great the restaurant has nice ambience although the staff can be a bit french for tucson their hudson valley foie gras is the best appetizer i ve had in arizona the steak tartare is also very good i remember the mussels having a bit more butter than i like they have bouillabaisse and cassoulet at times they were both 5 5 cassoulet can be shared their veal chop is another good dish to share as it is extremely marbled and delicious their grilled trout is good but not great their cheesecake is unremarkable they used to have a panna cotta or maybe it was some other gelatin based dessert that was much better
1572,taro cream cheese foam is delicious don t really get all the bad reviews the interior is gorgeous and modern do it for the gram
1573,i had dinner here on saturday night with a girlfriend our meals were amazing i had the salmon special came with mango salsa coconut risotto and veggies she had a steak i cannot rave enough about my meal salmon was tender and delicious if a touch under cooked i get that some people order medium salmon but i would prefer if it was cooked all the way through that may be a personal preference though risotto and veggies were the best i ve had my only issue was the ambiance decor this could be a high end restaurant if they modernized it it was nearly empty on a saturday at 7pm and i m sure the look of the place is part of the problem your food and beverages are good enough for five stars renovate the interior and modernize the feel and you ll have a gold mine
1574,great thing to do while in new orleans the food was good the view was great the narrator did a great job and the jazz band was very entertaining it was an all around good experience
1575,short take been doing business with maple for several years highly recommended as service and work are exemplary detailed review updating after another positive experience at maple collision it may seem odd to say that it s pleasant visiting a collision repair shop but i know from experience that when they repair a vehicle it will look and function as good or better than before the incident occurred that s very reassuring i have had the pleasure of speaking with pete the shop s owner ed and kathleen multiple times both on the phone and in person i have spoken to on the phone but have not yet met karen and kevin also multiple times everyone i have dealt with has been very professional pleasant and knowledgeable pete is very detail oriented and this shows in the way he runs the business as well as the finished product at maple everything is very upfront the work required is explained in detail and any questions are happily answered during the repair process communication is great and the work is completed quickly as for price i shopped around quite a bit prior to my first visit and found that maple s pricing was right in line with what other shops in the area were charging i no longer shop around as maple s expertise and customer service keep me coming back when the work is done everything is again explained in detail and questions are welcome this is the only body shop i ll go to or recommend to family friends whether the job is big or small and whether going through insurance or paying out of pocket edit whenever i have taken a vehicle to maple collision i ve received a thank you note in the mail afterwards nice touch see pics for most recent note first name scrambled by me for online posting
1576,love iguanas i was frequenting them most friday nights for a while everything i have had there has been great and the margaritas my favorite good atmosphere and food service is usually pretty good with the occasional inattentive waiter every once in a while but enough to keep me away a go to for a good mexican meal
1577,had a great time on our tour of the santa ynez wineries our tour guide ash was very informative and provided us with a perfect outing we enjoyed the chosen wineries and the wonderful lunch he set up for us thanks so much for helping to make our mini vacation complete
1578,i love their biscuits over loveless cafe its more flavorful creamier moist the sausage gravy was divine their homemade sausage so good we were lucky we only waited 15mins
1579,simply amazing small intimate and personal tried the feed me option and it did not disappoint every plate was sublimely prepared and the service was top rate a must when you desire a smart setting and sophisticated meal that is served by caring professionals who care about their craft
1580,employees are friendly and get the job done great options for your vehicle and they often have deals for a free wash
1581,i was in tucson this weekend and had read that fiamme was worth a visit the review didn t do it justice this is absolutely the most amazing pizza i was in italy this summer and this is better i m so impressed and will literally make the drive to tucson just for the pizza thank you
1582,excellent brews and service they also have a great food menus with an excellent variety of food items the meatloaf is out of this world our server was excellent and very friendly
1583,lovely place with very friendly and helpful staff i thought the no ac might be an issue but honestly it stays so cool that close to the ocean it wasn t an issue at all
1584,came here once with friends and enjoyed the coconut margarita the creamiest tableside guacamole made to my liking served with yummy fresh and warm thin tortilla chips and free churros i ordered a salad but the chicken was dry and the dressing requested on the side didn t please me i even asked for another dressing but still didn t quite hit the spot i d definitely come back for the margaritas guac chips and churros though
1585,i got the 2 the lemongrass tofu sandwich i didn t know what to expect going in but it was affordable and tasty not a bad experience in trying new things
1586,i can count on the food to be delicious every time no matter what i order the guy behind the counter is super friendly and accommodating and very important side note they make their own ooey gooey cake in house and it is some of the best i ve ever had my roommate my best friend and i consider this our go to spot for poboys i cannot heap enough praise on the place
1587,great food and awesome service there s normally a wait but a seat at the bar is the best seat in the house in my opinion awesome happy hour too
1588,this place was first class we were with a large group after an athletic event our arrival time was fluid they were very thorough by checking in but never made us feel that we were problematic management was very polished and servers were excellent food was very tasty highly recommend
1589,charming atmosphere and great burgers i never knew it was there in all the years traveling through def a family spot too
1590,great breakfast place i go weekly the menu has a lot od options the staff is always friendly i would definitely recommend
1591,this was the first spot during our new orleans vacation and it was definitely a success everything was absolutely delicious the food came out in a snap we re very glad to have picked this cozy spot as our first stop after all we came here for the food
1592,new and cool spot in downtown new orleans great variety of wines and local beers great food menu we had ros and white wines ordered a burger and a club sandwich everything was made to perfection our server paul was amazing he made our experience even more enjoyable favorite new spot
1593,loved this place the food was fresh and flavorful i loved the falafel salad with goat cheese the ciabatta and bisquits were house made and so delicious
1594,first time here and this place did not disappoint the chicken salad sandwich was so savory and delicious the flaky buttery croissant was amazing the green matcha lemonade was perfect for a hot saturday afternoon the french cuban sandwich is surprisingly good and original it paired perfectly with the cafe con leche we didn t find room for dessert but will definitely be back the pastry s looked and smelled enticing
1595,i ordered some takeout from here as it was the closest sushi spot and had the highest rating their specialty rolls are a bit pricey but they do have some standard priced fare at the end of the online menu the sushi was fresh and tasty they didn t skimp on the wasabi or ginger and i didn t have to ask for chopsticks next time we will dine in as it looked intimate and a nice bar i m sure the is more noteworthy sushi in the area they were our first try but not bad not bad at all
1596,great pizza salad and customer service definitely coming back for more pretty much a subway for pizza
1597,had great food live entertainment good service the sauces were good i recommend the pork sandwich
1598,best sunday brunch i do wish bartender told us about bloody mary bar when we ordered bloody mary s while we waited shrimp and grits the best
1599,food is good and priced ok slightly lacking in flavor with the ramen so i ll probably have to ask them to make it spicy next time as a comparison the pho at miss saigon is more flavorful than the chicken ramen i had that said the ramen itself was cooked well and the proportions were good my only major complaint is how the servers want to rush you through your meal my server literally asked me if i wanted the check when i was mid sentence with my dining companion i mean i guess i wasn t even fully finished with my meal and they were asking if they could clear plates we were not even dining that long probably there for a total of an hour maybe hour and fifteen i ll probably only get takeout from this place as dining there is not a positive experience they are more focused on turning tables than providing service
1600,this studio is definitely one of the nicest in town it is probably more on par with nyc or la in that regard always clean and the most updated equipment i have only had good instructors for every class i ve tried barre megaformer and spin every single class has been hard as hell and left me sore for days they lose one star for the really high price point although i appreciate that they now participate in classpass which helps and the inconvenience of the parking situation
1601,we were in new orleans on vacation and was told to try this place we first went on a sunday we had to wait because it was busy which was fine but we had to wait outside and it was very hot this was understandable because the place was full and they don t have much room inside the person taking everyone s name was rude and not friendly at all we ended up leaving sunday and decided to come back the next day when there were no lines the food was delicious and the owner was super nice the server was ok she was not very attentive and put a mandatory tip because our party had 6 it was a buffet so she didn t do much the owner gave us refills on our drinks and napkins and extra cream the food was great the service was ok and the prices were a little high
1602,fun place isabelle was great she was friendly and very accommodating she helped us decide between all the signature drinks they have here
1603,i m a huge fan of this location i have gotten designer clothing for under 5 paige denim banana republic aeropostale and max studio the store is organized and the women s section is the bulk of the store the men s section isn t as huge on variety so i only end up grabbing one thing if that the children s section is small so if you re here on the hunt for children or toddlers i suggest you try nesting house on passyunk or in west philadelphia for goodwill like prices tips shop during the week less traffic more freedom to shop without huge crowds pay attention to the discounted color tags in the front of the store the 50 color tags will be posted so you can shop for even deeper discounts grab a cart you ll need it holds items cannot be put on hold so come prepared to take your item furniture or large items with you hot items wedding dresses formal gowns stiletto heels high end department items for 10 00 boutique items begin at 10 00 a salesperson told me that a few customers actually buy here and resell items on posh mark and ebay i totally believe it
1604,great burgers got a chicken sandwich if i could have ate twice i would have got another chicken sandwich if i could have ate a third time i would have tried a burger homemade honey mustard and ketchup worth mixing together and drizzling over everything if you are a into that kinda thing fresh ingredients if your used to eating at mcdonald s you probly wouldn t understand would definitely go back
1605,this was some of the best steak that i have ever had the margaritas were very good we had the corn side and
1606,just getting around to post adorable place that could be missed people are so kind sushi good but i m from cali have lived in ropongi japan so far this is my fav place for sushi desert dining enjoy t
1607,one of my favorite breakfast joints in nash love bringing fam here when i have them in town amazing bloody mary s biscuits well worth the wait always
1608,stopped in for a spur of the moment 8pm dinner and were able to walk right in it was such a pleasant surprise we ordered the scallops and another fish dish that came with crawfish the fish was perfectly flavored with a sauce but i have to say the scallops were probably the best i have ever had they were incredible we ended the evening with their chocolate lava cake and cream puffs a beautiful and delicious meal
1609,i m reminiscing and thinking of florida sunshine we got married by captain dave on anclote key by windsong charters it was a perfect wedding and windsong was the perfect charter to do it we choose the seashore vows and wendy was super helpful through the whole process from booking to all the details it was a wedding on an island at sunset what could be more perfect than that this is going to be an annual tradition of renting a boat from windsong and visiting the island each year we go back
1610,so i ve been craving bbq and i never knew this place really existed so we tried it for my overall experience the service was quick i had the brisket my family had the pulled pork which was all good i had potato casserole which was awesome but i did have green beans they were not good at all other than that everything is great

1613,mike heidi and tashi are the best i love my electric bike and feel like my whole life has changed since getting it i can t say enough good things about the shop and the service these guys are experts in the electric bike world and take amazing care of their customers
1614,it was pretty crowded when we went but it was before an lsu game in the dome the wait was about 45 min and even then it took us a while to get food the food was decent for sports bar type stuff but they really need to up their draft beer game i ve been to other d b s that had better local brews to choose from since i don t consider blue moon or stella to be craft beer i was pretty disappointed i believe i had a lagunitas but there s too many awesome nola breweries to be serving that stuff
1615,i ve been meaning to try this for a while it was a super welcoming environment really warm and friendly i placed a take out for margarita dop right with the man making the pizzas i saw a pepperoni pizza that had just come out of the oven shaped like a heart i said how nice that was and he offered to make mine into a heart it was so nice and a small detail of service that is uncommon these days the pizza was delicious and it ll be working into my regular rotation
1616,good breakfast not all your traditional meals but fresh and delicious i love the nest sub with scrambled eggs ask for jelly after you eat the eggs out of the biscuit they make their own staff is friendly and quick several pastry baked options at the register yum fresh coffee and lattes
1617,friendly staff quick service and delicious food just a little cramped inside other than that would recommend

1621,tried a second time table for 6 we arrived early and had drinks at the bar before being seated friendly and knowledgeable bartender great hemingway daiquiris the food was amazing as expected this place is definitely a hidden gem very unassuming from the outside and very warm and cozy inside you ve got to try it very unique menu between six of us we tried almost everything and it was all grea
1622,i have never once ordered a cinnamon roll and thought i wish i had a diffevent flavor icing or more toppings for this that being said my kids thought it was a great idea i also thoroughly enjoyed the old skool roll and thought it warm and sweet but not too sweet we will definitely go back they could definitely have a better drink selection would be my only feedback
1623,this was my first time coming here the line was pretty busy for a saturday lunch time but they had 3 people taking orders so it moved through pretty fast very clean inside and restrooms clean as well wr ordered the choose two garden salad and the veggie sandwich and the french dip roast beef sandwich and country potato soup the meal was delivered to the table in a timely manner and staff was very friendly food was delicious

1629,i ve past this place a number of times and glad i stopped i got the chicken pad tai to go it was great nice portion well presented and a container of red pepper to make it as hot as i wanted
1630,great food and atmosphere especially for fast casual you order at the counter and they bring the food to the table ceasar salad and beets with green salad were both great family had four different calzones all trendy and delicious not your grandfathers calzone place good beer and soda selection wine list is shorter but their suggestion for wine for a calzone was spot one thanks
1631,i got the small banana pudding concrete with hot fudge and it was delicious the custard and hot fudge were very creamy a little too much for liking i recommend trying atleast once

1635,visited last evening and we will be coming back repeatedly coming from the south we missed a good bbq place the smoked turkey was so good my favorite my son devoured his smoked turkey kids meal and the brisket was tender and delicious as well baked beans are phenomenal corn bread is amazing and the sauces are each unique and good in their own way the staff was super friendly helpful and i love that it s a few blocks from my house the prices are fair you get a lot of meat with your meals
1636,wonderful quaint bar with cool clients and an incredibly charming staff chefon made me feel so at home she s beautiful and very funny she recommended the poutine mmm i wish i could stay in new orleans forever
1637,as an indian woman from chicago i was worried i would never find a decent indian restaurant in st pete i am so happy that deccan came to town authentic flavors great menu friendly service not overly spicy and a good value happy hour even on saturdays so many indian places around here water down their menu to cater to american palates this place is not afraid to do it right it s a big space and a difficult location so i m going to do my best to keep them in business give it a try
1638,delicious both the burritos and vietnamese come often for pho and great vietnamese food but tried a burrito today for the first time i am hooked

1645,i had a wax with melissa she was very professional kind and knowledgeable she made sure to have the environment relaxing with great music and a good convo also she gave me a new client discount without me even asking the price which shows true professionalism and someone who knows how to please clients although with it came the usual pain she was quick and efficient i love the result and will return if i am ever back in new orleans
1646,very weird beer we ordered a cider and it s either gone bad or they just have horrible cider didn t drink it didn t get refund ordered guinness just to be safe but somehow it tasted weird as well but drinkable the atmosphere here is bit sad too whole bunch of guys sitting around staring at the tv not as clean as i had hoped for a popular bar
1647,party of two and we had to wait a little over an hour for our food the server was extremely friendly as was the management staff who took some money off of our bill without even being asked to food was absolutely delicious kitchen was a little backed up but it was okay because of the awesome service
1648,amazing guacamole friendly service eclectic atmosphere wonderful food love the variety and freshness definitely a must visit,i greatly enjoyed the food the service was quick and efficient breakfast is the best their california benedict is amazing great brunch spot we will definitely be returning

1650,this is the best burger place you can have eat the peanuts while you wait and if you want to eat the peanuts with the shells on they won t even kick you out there s so many toppings like mushrooms catchup and cheese it s to die for my mouth is watering just thinking about this place if you run into a guy wearing spandex be weary,wingardium leviosa if you like harry potter this is the place for you are you an english major well they have beers named after books they also have books one day a week they have vegan chili and another they have open mics super knowledgeable staff too
1651,this is by far my favorite chinese place to eat and my 5 year old loves their sweet and sour chicken with lomein noodles
1652,i went here for the first time yesterday and i was so happy i have been in ardmore for over two years but never went to this salon for a pedicure i was always driving out of my way to somewhere in kop however never again i got the best pedicure i have ever had yesterday they do the best job and estela was amazing thank you olive nails for the best experience you ll be the only place i ever go back to
1653,this realty company and erika robertson have been great since day 1 i recommend them to anyone looking for a great fit for them and their family because they will find it for you
1654,this is very nice place to show and enjoy and eat relaxing time it s well worth the money
1655,we had the pleasure of dining at mahoney s on friday august 31st at about 7 30pm with a party of two this was our first time ever at this restaurant chain we arrived and were promptly seated at a table by the window the interior of this restaurant is very classy casual and we enjoyed the environment for our party of two we decided to share the buffalo fried oysters the etouffee fries and a fried shrimp po boy we thought all of our food was delicious really yummy the fries and oysters were amazing we enjoyed our visit and there are definitely other menu items we would like to try the reason for the one star deduction is that our server definitely made it clear that for some reason she was irritated i m not sure if she would have rather been at home or if there was another reason however she was very short and snappy she clearly was not presenting genuine hospitality
1656,i was in town and our hotel was right next to this popeyes i have a love hate relationship with popeyes because when it s good it s great but lately most locations in chicagoland have burned me i must say this is one of the best popeye locations i ve been to in a while better than the one i went to in new orleans employees were friendly chicken was piping hot and delicious i must ve caught them on a good day because i d easily go back there whenever i m back in town
1657,this is by far my favorite brewery in new orleans the beer is second to none and the bartenders are always pretty friendly the taproom itself is nice when the garage doors are open and there is a nice breeze the grapefruit ipa and the paradise park lager are both top notch
1658,great place to go fill your own water bottles purified or alkaline the owners are so nice and everything is so clean love the outside options in case they are closed for a holiday or after hours
1659,the fish tacos are my go to item here there is a self serve salsa bar the quality of some of the stuff in the salsa could definitely be better but it s not too big of a deal i have also tried the carne asada and the chicken tacos they are also pretty good
1660,we previously ordered traditional greek fare here gyros spanakopita falafel tonight i tried the blackened tilapia so glad i did it was fantastic delicious meal and good service from sarah
1661,so glad we stopped by the soft serve ice cream with vanilla cake was delicious the kids loved it i m giving them a 5 stars because the staff were super friendly definitely stopping by the next time we visit reno again
1662,we have four kiddos ages 9 14 all with very different and specific tastes preferences additionally i make homemade pizza dough from scratch so these kids know their stuff when it comes to pizza that being said all six of us love blaze and are super happy they are in the neighborhood especially within walking distance base is not overly dough y ingredients are fresh cost is reasonable parm and hot pepper shakers are clean and accessible refillable drinks recycling and lots of flexibility with the menu choices but my absolute favorite part is the staff in our family we promote kindness thoughtfulness flexibility service to others and big smiles every time we ve been to blaze every single person has exuded these traits from beginning to end and if that s not enough each person asks as they add ingredients if the amount they ve put on is to your liking so rad the work culture shines through at this location and is very very much appreciated keep doing your beautiful thing blaze we ll be back and i m sorry i have to address the dork below that gave a one star rating because his pizza was cold when he called in an order for a 6pm pizza but picked it up at 6 18 dude remove your post everyone knows being 18 min late to pick up a pizza is a lifetime any pizza will be cold and dead that s your mistake for not getting there it s not okay to give a hard working business a poor rating because you couldn t get there in time ignore that peeps and blaze on
1663,beje completely exceeded our expectations my now fianc brought josh my grandmother s ring to be reset and updated for me josh was amazing and although my fianc knows absolutely nothing about diamonds josh made him feel comfortable and there was no doubt he knew exactly what he was talking about once my fianc proposed with the ring i couldn t believe it was the same one we will definitely use beje over and over again
1664,this used to be one of my favorite thrift stores because it always had very unique well taken care of items i loved how much stuff that was always stocked on its shelves i could spend hours in this place and still not be able to see everything which made the thrill of the hunt very enjoyable however since they change management the shelves are much more sparse the few items they do have are still nice quality
1665,i pass this place all the time and finally thought i d give it a try the ambiance is nice for this place lots of variety and options but everything was mediocre i had some high hopes for this place but i don t think i ll be going back anytime soon service was fine though
1666,alma llanera is a trip to the heart of venezuela we were starving for real arepas and empanadas and this place delivered perfectly everything was fresh and huge delicious portions we have tried other venezuelan resturants around florida and alma llanera is the top on our list viva venezuela we will be back
1667,i went simple with biscuits and bacon unbelievable amazing seriously full of love i am smitten i know it sounds crazy over something so simple but seriously i am over the top with biscuit love make sure to try the little side of strawberry love you will not be disappointed with this place except you might have to wait in long line outside but all worth the wait we also had the bonuts with lemon mascarpone and blueberry compote great but loved bacon biscuit with strawberry love more
1668,this place is worth a visit we got in line about 30 min before the 5pm show and were in the first standing row so we could see the musicians play the whole time we entered at 5pm cash only 15 20 per person and they played from 5 15 6pm the musicians were friendly and played great music the show is a little pricey but it goes to a good cause and it s neat to be in a space with so much history go if you can and be ready to stand you can also buy tickets online that are more expensive but they reserve a seat for you if standing isn t your thing also i think the first 30 folks or so in line got seats as well kids sit on cushions in the front
1669,nelson was amazing he rescued us when we couldn t get an uber after jazz fest nelson was so polite and accommodating that we ended up using him and his company for all of our transportation needs during our stay
1670,we had such a great time pat the owner reserved a couple bikes for us on labor day weekend and off we went cruised the harbor and up the hill to the park with very little effort stopped off for lunch and we had zero stress because pat supplied a bike lock went into the funk zone and some wine tasting while everyone else was on foot we were able to cover major ground and we breezed through traffic recommend highly and we will do it again as we visit here often we had a lot of fun
1671,great breakfast tacos can t beat the price for what you get to top it off the flavor is amazing fast friendly helpful and clean you will leave full and happy
1672,favorite restaurant in nola so far anyway lol great service amazing food we went twice in in two days the chicken and waffle is absolutely delicious their fig and blue cheese dip with pita chips are awesome honestly everything we tried was really good including their drinks a great spot for breakfast lunch or dinner even if you arent into seafood you can find something you ll enjoy

1675,we came for my wife s birthday we sat in the mezzanine the lady serving forgot one of the seven plates we ordered and gave us a free cocktail to make up for it every dish was amazing the dessert was fantastic the coffee and cocktails were outstanding this is a must try if only for the whipped feta and the gnocchi,great little spot for having done local beers it s a bit small not some place i d go extremely often but good to mark off the list nothing super unique but they know what they are and they do it well very nice staff
1676,my family and i were visiting from ca and it was our first time at a chick fil a we ordered the spicy chicken original chicken chicken nuggets strips fries and had a cookies and cream shake food was great we loved the sauces the only down point was the service i asked the guy if there were free refills on the soda and he yes and the staff would be walking around every time i asked for a refill i d get a surprised or annoyed look it wasn t busy and i didn t understand why they just didn t put the fountain machines in the lobby like a normal restaurant
1677,absolutely phenomenal food drinks service and staff my party of 3 and i had a wonderful evening and constantine our server was so passionate towards our experience highly recommend
1678,i went to the buffet for a basic breakfast because it was close to the cafes price i thought the buffet had good choices although i didn t try everything and i realize that everyone s favorites might not be there i just had bacon scrambled eggs hash browns and a cinnamon roll everything was at least satisfactory except the cinnamon roll which was excellent it was the only roll i ve found that is comparable to cinnabon s maybe the roll was a little soft but that was more than made up for by the flavor i knew it would be bad but i had to go back for seconds it took a lot of willpower not to just stay and eat roll after roll especially since by that point they were effectively free i don t know how lunch and supper buffets are which is why this os only four stars but the cinnamon rolls are five stars in my book and the service was also very good
1679,very hesitant about trying new thai places but decided to give this a try since it s so close to home pad thai was delicious very friendly staff will be coming back
1680,your nostrils are greeted with a potpourri of manure and bathroom place stinks like a barn giving it an authentic atmosphere food is overpriced and of average decent quality baby back ribs were burned at one end turned into charcoal the rest was fine waitress practically threw the menus at us with a scowl on her face 3 5 room for improvement
1681,the food was excellent best mexican food i ate in a long time i have eaten in a few cities houston vegas and san diego nothing as good as this spot beef was excellent sat at the bar great service compliments to jerry and robert i had to slow down on those great drinks overall i would recommend this spot tok any one in tuscon visiting great great spot and i have been to quite a few mex spots in ny
1682,i just discovered this place and another thrift shop and i love them huge room full of clothes shoes toys books dvd s some blu rays some electronics cameras furniture dishes friendly staff low low prices i found a used radio alarm clock worth 100 for 7 today
1683,i was very impressed with this local food hub my fianc and i were staying the night in carpinteria for our valentine s day weekend and i wanted to make sure that i took him to a scenic and delicious spot for dinner after scouring yelp for places with good reviews i finally decided on this little place i was so pleasantly surprised not only with quality in food but also the friendly staff and ambiance this location is definitely the perfect place for a cute date night or even family event the seating area gives you the option of porch seating with cozy chairs and heaters or outdoor seating with picnic tables and a really cute grassy layout the food was amazing and i would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something new
1684,it s a nice place in the middle of no where went there to watch a ball game found the love of my life
1685,service was a bit slow for saturday lunch but not unacceptable understandable as a new place gets its feet under it i tried to go friday night and it was a total mess long line and nobody taking names we left the margarita was great i had the cilantro chicken enchiladas also great the outdoor seating area was very pleasant under the umbrellas on a lovely saturday afternoon overall i liked it they just need a bit more time to figure out the flow i m thrilled to see something affordable move into my neighborhood the prices are very reasonable and this place isn t trying to be casual fancy like the last two train wrecks that occupied this space hope loco thrives for years to come
1686,my first time there food was amazing i had the smash and stack burger fried pickles service was great had the homemade ice cream will definitely be back
1687,good tom ka gai and curry dishes the food overall is pretty good we like to come here for our thai fix

1689,went for happy hour for the second time most recently our first visit the food was very good but our second visit was terrible so mixed results although the happier menu and prices are not bad at all
1690,we had katsu don and sushi and sashimi combo the don was salty and the fried chicken was so wet fish was not fresh not deserve 4 stars at all
1691,i went to this place right after cardinals game ended and the place was super packed regardless of that the place is pretty big and can accommodate a lot of people on tables and also near the bar i tried their 16 thin sliced cheese pizza with onion and jalapenos and it was delicious i got their pizza to go and ate it at the park right across from it which i would really recommend doing eventhough it was pretty packed our order was ready within 15 mins which i really appreciated since i was really hungry lol
1692,the fountain on locust is a saint louis gem i try to take all my out of town family and friends here they achieve a nice balance of standard american food blended with many unique food items that are specific to the style and ideas of fountain on locust for example they have pickle soup not a lot of options if you are a vegetarian but i am and always make do my go to items are the tomato soup grilled cheese sutz salad and the veggie focaccia sandwich the basil faulty cocktail is also another special menu item imo cost is reasonable usually not a wait and generally open street parking unless there is a concert or basketball game at chaifetz i will always frequent fountain on locust as one of the favorite local spots
1693,went here last minute looking for italian food and was not disappointed everything we ordered was really very good with enough fir leftovers for the next day if looking for good pasta i definitely recommend
1694,i went to luke with a friend for the happy hour and we had really good experience the decoration and the service both met my expectation we tried raw oysters fried oyster and red bean and rice on their daily special menu all of them are good i am surprised that their fried oysters are not too greasy overall it was a great experience and i will definitely visit again
1695,a very clean and friendly salon the stylists are all very nice and have a lot of knowledge about hair i have natural black hair and was coloring my hair for the first time i wanted a caramel balayage which my stylist thought was fitting he provided some education on some of the products he was using and explained what style would look nice after he was done he recommended certain shampoos that i can use to keep the color nice it s a great place to go if you want your hair to be done right
1696,best food truck in ccp area their food is neat clean and very authentic their food portions are good and taste is worth it it
1697,i ordered a bento box for takeout and it was delicious my wife at suggested that a bento box would be an interesting and new way to experience japanese food i googled bento box nearby and bussemey japanese steakhouse came up as one of the options i ordered online and the wait time was approximately 20 minutes when i arrived the food was ready and piping hot it was absolutely delicious i will be ordering from masami again in the future
1698,the food at qdoba is always great the staff at this location was also great i got the bowl with chicken it is just the right amount of food at the right price the decor in this location is modern and has a nice rustic feel i will definitely come back to this location again,firehouse is one of my go to places this new location is right near my house the staff here is friendly and doesn t rush you even if they are busy i like all of their toasty subs so i can t recommend just one if you re tired of the boring subs from from subway you should give firehouse a try you will love it and this new location
1699,fabulous restaurant good service good portions at a fair price i had ceviche and it was perfect highly recommended
1700,so it s my forth time staying here and i have to say it s kind of weird how i can literally hear everything outside and what my neighbor is doing they are showing rn and she s listening to something weird these windows don t keep the sound out people just discovered they give us robes
1701,we ordered the salmon dinner mackerel dinner and the mahi mahi lunch portion the dinners are definitely large enough to split with two people the german potato salad served as a side is very delicious as well launch size portions when available are definitely a one person serving size ok yes i also ordered the key lime pie slice but it was to go it was delicious as well stumbled on this place a few years ago every time we come back to the golf side i try to go to this place because it s that good would recommend this place to any smoked fish lover
1702,loved it we made a reservation and everything was ready when we arrived 5 minutes before our scheduled time the food service was amazing our waiter kris knew his stuff he recommended good red wine and good food we had the crab cake the salmon with pecan sweet potatoes this is what i was waiting for when i visited new orleans for my mind to go omg that was delicious my fianc is a chef and he said that the food was amazing that he would def come back the dessert was blackberry something alaska it was okay side note we saw them pick up a table they actually change the table cloth instead of just putting new plates and utensils great restaurant we couldn t go upstairs because there was an event but def doing back tomorrow
1703,the vegan pecan turtle bar was by far the best vegan baked good i have ever consumed my non vegan girlfriend was also impressed she also loved the poptart that they recommended for her if they added more vegan options to their daily menu i would not complain
1704,i m in the clearwater area quite often for business so i m always looking for good restaurants cafe ponte was a recommendation from the customer who was joining us for dinner and it did not disappoint the lobster bisque was excellent with just a hint of habanero something unique that i was not expecting i had the boullibaisse which was loaded with seafood in a rich broth i will definitely be back the next time i m in town
1705,excellent service and the hamburgers we highly recommend cocktails are also wonderful and alexis was the best
1706,if you want actual street style tacos this is the place i tried chicken steak shredded beef and fish tacos and they were all amazing get the street style toppings on it i also tried their watermelon juice which was amazing they give free chips and they have a nice salsa bar great service overall
1707,amazing selection of desserts i tried the devils food chocolate mousse cake and it was delicious they have reasonable prices for desserts place to sit they also have apple pay for payment
1708,fun atmosphere and outstanding food service was pleasant but very slow so don t go crazy starving just one server and one cook for the whole place the mexican chicken torta sandwich was the bomb food was very fresh and creative i will go back
1709,everyone must try the sauce and meatballs life changing the stl personalized historical rendition of the cathedral ceiling is intriguing makes me want to learn about all the famous people that came from stl
1710,i came for lunch on a tuesday the restaurant wasn t super busy mostly populated by work lunch groups the atmosphere and space are really neat and could adapt easily to a girls lunch business lunch or romantic dinner i started with a tequila cocktail which was absolutely beautiful and refreshing for lunch i had the korean chicken sandwich the fries were incredible they must have been fried twice because they were super crisp i definitely over ate because the meal was so delicious jj my server was also super friendly i d recommend hemingway s for a variety of occasions i m sure you wouldn t get tired of the cocktails or food
1711,best food in iv quality food and always consistent my favorite are the kalbi and baby baked lobster roll so good
1712,we came here for lunch on a monday and it was pretty empty we had an awesome table in the back and there were not many tables near us the dcor is great and it had that clean fresh vibe parking was a little difficult as they share a small parking lot with other businesses and street parking was not readily available we got a handful of appetizers all small and cheap so you can try many of them and my favorite was the whipped feta it was unlike anything i have had and was great to the mouth for my entre i got the chicken shawarma which was different and fresh tasting but didn t jive with my taste buds for some reason the bathrooms are a must here and the soap is so great we picked up a few bottles for home they sell it there the service was great
1713,wait here for lunch during the week between christmas and new years with 6 elementary age girl scouts nonwait great service and the server named nico was very patient with the 6 scouts answering questions bringing extra sauces etc all 6 scouts had ice cream and proclaimed baileys range to be their new favorite place this moms burger was delicious too thx
1714,i like this place but it s really frustrating me that the pizza has so much untapped potential if someone would just work on replacing the sauce another reviewer said it best in that the sauce here is very soup y and bland my 2 cents it completely takes away from how good this pizza really could be i wanted to start a petition for new sauce but i m lazy so this review will have to do oooo ooohhhh so random but maybe it could be a customer contest and the winner gets free beer pizza for the year and if this idea is used then i also need free beer pizza for the year too got it mmm hmm kayyy thanks or scrap that plan and just use prego dammit i mean anything but what y all using now lol all jokes aside i like it here affordable prices nice atmosphere friendly service and pretty good beer just needs to work on the sauc ok ok i won t get into that again but you get the point
1715,i ve stopped here a few times for papers and small stuff their location is convenient but the staff is rude and the items are very over priced i go to frolic for any substantial purchases it s worth the extra drive
1716,beautiful hotel the plaza grill has great food and surprisingly reasonable prices considering it is in a hotel chelsea the bartender is exceptional the night i was there a 300 person conference was taking place when it ended giant groups of people came down at once to order appetizers and drinks she was the only bartender scheduled that evening the poor girl was running ragged but handled it like a trooper she still maintained her composure and stayed on point with everybody s orders while she was being flooded please plaza hotel plan on having at least 2 bartenders at times you have giant conferences chelsea did great but nobody should be alone for giant crowds
1717,we were surprised to find there was no beer but the mead and ciders were pretty good and well priced but very odd set up not a great environment bathrooms were also very stinky which was unpleasant,really amazing place definitely worth the visit but will be a more expensive outing we got their around 4 00 on sunday and it was already packed would highly recommend getting there earlier to make sure you get a table the cheese board was delicious and gorgeous the menu food smelled amazing too loved it here
1718,fast great service delicious one of our favorite spots the ingredients are fresh and pizzas come out hot a good bang for your buck too
1719,so yesterday we were caught in a spontaneous monsoon dropped on us in the french quarter the ladies gave us refuge for their graciousness i bought some little items which included hand poured buttons which ate so lovely thank you again for saving a couple of nearly drowned rats
1720,i had a minor issue with making a reservation at the renaissance new orleans arts warehouse district hotel but some of that was on me it was not enough to deduct but enough to comment about i was also planning on driving to new orleans but when i found out that it was 45 a day for valet and no self parking was available i ditched the plan to drive and flew in instead btw once i got here i realized that meter parking is available in and around the hotel and that you don t have to feed the meters a portion of the weekend i checked in the same afternoon as two of my siblings and even though the reservations were all done separate we were fortunate enough to get a room next door to theirs the staff at the front desk and the concierge were helpful as expected the room was ok the hinges on the armoire that the tv sat on and houses the mini fridge and drawers needed a little tlc when i checked in one of the two bulbs above the bathroom vanity was burnt out i didn t report it but sometime after the room was cleaned the bulb was replaced the hotel gym was typical for a hotel the rooftop pool had a beautiful view of downtown being here on the of first saturday in august the street in front of the hotel is virtually taken over by the whitney white linen night crowd checkout was at 11am but i asked for a 1pm checkout it was granted but housekeeping came by at both 11 and noon to check to see if i had already gone
1721,skeptical new orleans native here far exceeded my expectations the fried oyster salad is the best salad i have ever had the gumbo was hearty made with a dark roux togo was quick and the server was enjoyable worth it
1722,we stopped for a lunch break the restaurant was almost empty so we did not wait for a table the service was nice the fish tacos were tasty scalops with rice were also good we were not given bread even though other guests got it the prices are a bit high
1723,if you re looking for good deals on furniture this is the place to go we experienced great customer service from the beginning to the end we were able to find the furniture that fit our needs ryan brown and isabella stokes worked together on assisting us never pushy and very patient they are the best
1724,peppermill is my fave when visiting reno generous with rooms just wish they would do the resort fees more love love love spa toscana it s become a must when visiting restaurants are excellent looking forward to trying the nightclub just haven t made it out yet i do appreciate them trying to fix mistakes a few months ago i had an extra charge on my card and some small issues with my stay they offered a dining voucher for my next stay but when i brought it up this time they didn t know about it but still tried to make it right i appreciate that i do hope they consider making a pool club would make the trips to reno during the summer a little more over the top my only major complaint is house keeping every time it s terrible so i declined on this trip especially because housekeeping always comes in at 9 am while my boyfriend and i are sleeping i mean come on it s a casino after declining this trip they still tried to come in at 10 am omg
1725,i have been a snowbird from illinois for the past 5 years and now we moved here permanently i wasn t able to get a good pedicure all the time i was coming down here to st pete beach until now i tried alyssa salon and debbie did my pedicure she gave me the best pedicure i ever had she s very thorough and very good at giving pedicures the salon is a very welcoming place and everyone is so friendly from the minute you walk into the place i am ecstatic that i found a great pedicurist i also had my hair done 2 weeks later by lynda scillitani and she is a fantastic stylist she s also an expert in hair coloring she mixed a color for my hair that was perfect it s like my natural color this salon is a beach treasure i am so happy with alyssa s salon and will tell my friends
1726,we were greeted with a warm welcome and were seated right away we had a very friendly waitress named jamie who was attentive and helpful with a great attitude the beer on tap was cold we had the bbq burger grilled cheese and ham and the chicken quesadilla and these were all wonderful very clean and rustic place
1727,not recommended if you are hungry unable to provide timely service food could be better for the time it takes to receive your meal also they should not serve burned hash browns coffee was good
1728,i like their food the soy milk is my favor drink and sushi too will back again
1729,super super friendly baristas the best peppermint mocha s in town and the drive thru is very fast even in the busiest part of the morning definitely drive a bit out of my way to go to this particular store when i need a s bucks

1731,our whole family has had work done with dr song he s wonderful he operated on my toenail and i didn t feel a thing his wife works in the office and she is so sweet i highly recommend dr song
1732,knowledgeable bartenders fantastic drinks and live music what else could you want try the pachamama llama
1733,work got food from here catered the food was delicious but found some bones in the ziti we ordered it was unexpected and we wondered why there were bones when it was beef but everything else was delicious it was easy to order and pick up the tiramisu was to die for must get if it s a dessert you desire
1734,the donuts here are nothing short of great the texture and taste are clear indicators that their donuts are some of the best around the only bad thing about this place is the lack of coffee options a great iced coffee paired with our donuts would have been euphoric
1735,nostalgia is an emotion exclusive to the human race a glorious exploration of one s self and past all wrapped up in the glory of a former kiss crawl or cry the nostalgia i felt for this magic place was born when i first blew into town fresh off a bender in syracuse i was led up to table rock by a group of tourists i was stalking to see the sights and have a sense of belonging long story short i didn t make any friends and after drinking some wine had a nasty tumble down the hillside this time however it seemed satan himself was breathing down my neck and it showed i was soon stumbling around the hillside before collapsing the sun began to play strange tricks on my mind i was seeing things the empty rock suddenly was filled with imaginary people milling about as i kneeled gasping for breath and quivering i was most shocked when suddenly my leg began to vibrate a deep shuddering frequency collapsing into my bones it was janet from accounting i d have to call her back i lay paralyzed on the rocks unable to move for what seemed like hours as the day slowly melted into evening and as i whimpered on the hot brown rock in a puddle of sweat holding back the tears i called out to god i began to repent for everything i had done all that stuff with carol and that bridge how stupid i had been i remembered all that stuff back at the house on the hill how the news vans came and the horrible things they said maybe they were right maybe i was a mud covered man charged with breaking and entering found sleeping facedown in a vacant dog bed i called out again i called out for redemption and suddenly he came to me i turned my head to notice the symbol of jesus s everlasting love smiling down on me illuminated in the forthcoming night he spoke to me tenderly sir are you ok a click of a radio and soon the paramedics arrived and as i was treated for what they called dehydration and heat stroke brought on by excessive perspiration i knew the truth i was being treated for enlightenment and i was ok with that i had come up here to relive old times but i had found my future i was glazed with a grizzly sunburn and the hopeful excitement for the future and though my shirtless body was crispy and peeling the my heart was softer than it had ever been
1736,very happy this place was open til 11 as we got to have a late dinner here upon arriving in philly i got the crispy hipcity ranch chik n sandwich and was very impressed the chik n had a great crunch and tasted just as good as the real thing disappointed in the vanilla milkshake but i think i would have enjoyed it more if i d ordered a different flavor my boyfriend got a chocolate shake and his tasted much better the chocolate definitely helped disguise the chalky texture
1737,we really enjoyed our first meal at b2 bluefin tonight friendly staff nice atmosphere and excellent sushi the waiter was helpful with selecting rolls for my children i will be returning in the future
1738,absolutely love this place the staff has always been so kind and eager to engage in friendly conversation the selection and flavors of no baked cookie dough are splendid and continue to be a a favorite go to sweet treat
1739,not knowing carpinteria at all we yelped the best lunch and padaro came up we really liked it the fish chips and grilled fish tacos were great very fresh no fishy taste whatsoever great draft beer selection too the cute beachy area for the kids to play is an awesome idea for those with little the counter area faces the beach ocean with various heights of the chairs for your perfect view we highly recommend padaro
1740,we had the pleasure of dining here for dinner last week and it was truly incredible from start to finish the ambiance was warm the music was perfect the vibe was so relaxing and upscale the drinks were refreshing and prepared beautifully and the food was on another level of amazing we started with the fig toast and mussels both delicious mussels packed some heat and a really nice flavor and the house made sour dough loaf was perfect for dipping in the extra sauce the pizzas are like no other with a sourdough crust nice and thin with tons of flavor and it was lower in carbs so we weren t totally stuffed after sharing one before our entrees my husband had the burger 2 juicy 4 ounce patties with camembert melted in between topped with charred onions and their secret 789 sauce heaven and i had the scallops cooked to perfection served over an aquerello risotto earthy light and delicious the service was top notch finally something unique on the main line i want to compare it to a downtown vibe but it s honestly even better than that the place has such a good high energy that makes you feel welcomed and like you re in the hot spot in town amazing wine list and overall perfect addition to the main line
1741,have enjoyed this creamery for years always amazed at the variety available and speed of receiving my order which is aways perfect first visited in 1961 when i was a boarder at a high school in the county and the locals wanted to proudly show off their town getting to ted drewes was never a chore because someone was alway looking for a weekend treat now that we have grandchildren in the area and we gave recently moved back to st louis one of the first places we choose to take our visitors is ted drewes thanks for continuing your legacy of excellent taste and service
1742,i was told that port of call was the place to go for the best burger in nola but i truly believe the only people saying that are the people that haven t eaten at district my boyfriend ordered the double cheeseburger and i ordered the croque madame per the recommendation of mike the awesome guy working that took our order without being overly dramatic i m pretty sure their double cheeseburger is hands down the juiciest burger i ve ever had the pleasure of tasting my boyfriend let me have a bite in my entire life the croque madam is equally delicious as they use a griddled donut no glaze as the bun so you get this decadent sweet salty combination the donut does a fabulous job soaking up the melted havarti cheese and runny yolk from the sunnyside up egg they top the sandwich with yum writing this review makes me want to go back for a second round of deliciousness the only thing i wish they would add as a permanent menu item is the double cheeseburger atop a griddled donut bun that sweet salty combination would absolutely take the cake you could easily think a donut store with burgers riiiight and continue walking by because donuts and burgers together doesn t make a whole lot of sense but do yourself a favor put this place on the top of your list to try in nola oh and the donuts are good too please bring district to kc
1743,walked by this place a few times had it on our list to try what a mistake walking by it and not eating there i mean odd set up upscale pizza place in the back of a gelatto parlour worked for us food we ordered two pizzas margherita con bufala genovese both were excellent no idea what some of my fellow reviewers are talking about re inauthentic neapolitan pizza we ve had neapolitan pizza in naples italy capofitto doesn t make it any differently sorbetto we tried two kinds both excellent tip next time i would get a a few tasters in the front on the way in so i d be better prepared to order after our meal service our server adam was freaking outstanding very attentive very helpful looking forward to our next visit
1744,this place was great we waited in line for about 20 minutes which wasn t too bad the food was pretty good i would give it 8 10 always some room for improvement i had the princess and it was very yummy the chicken was super juicy the biscuit did fall apart very easily the service needed a little improvement probably because it was so busy would try this place again
1745,one dish the fried rice it s perfect they are open late when everything else in new orleans closes early food is fire af oh they also accommodate vegans an vegetarians
1746,tacos enchiladas empanadas you will not be disappointed the shrimp enchiladas were my favorite along with the mushroom and loved the guacamole and queso such a cute place to enjoy some great tex mex
1747,take me back in time to the old fashioned ice cream parlor with the old flooring of the don cesar hotel and a juke box
1748,a real surprise wonderful find fresh ingredients amazing tacos fish chicken beef tasted like steak great salsa chips
1749,hotel indigo was a quiet little secret homey warm convenient to everything and the staff were awesome we highly recommend this little gem
1750,wow new orleans truly has more to offer than just the french quarter i don t even like donut that much but i decided to try and wow love them the donut does not taste oily like other stores we actually came back twice within two days timeframe to get more the mexican chocolate sangaia brown sugar cake donut lemon blueberry and pork belly kolaches were good why they don t get my 5th star the server boldly asked for more tip from us i would come back for the food though
1751,what a great experience we sat at the bar and had a birdseye view of the kitchen and were able to see all the various dishes as they were prepared the bartender was extremely attentive kind and had wonderful words of wisdom about pairings and suggested dishes my husband had the steak special and i had the salmon crepes each were delicate and delicious the dessert of pavlova with strawberry rhubarb and pistachio was a perfect springtime treat and the chocolate mousse was beautiful paired with a 10 yr port the whole atmosphere was gorgeous personable and clearly driven by passion absolutely recommend
1752,we returned to charro steak about 2 weeks ago and four of us had an excellent experience service wendell i believe was great knowledgeable prompt friendly and made us want to return but the real reason for returning was the far better food experience we enjoyed on this visit the steaks were very flavorful perfectly rare medium and delicious sides were properly cooked and very good wine was good as were desserts it met our expectations and i will happily recommend it to friends i wish there was a way to give it 4 1 2 stars
1753,we were so excited to find a dog friendly place for breakfast this morning the staff was super friendly and the owner brought out some water for my pup and even hung out to visit for a few on top of all this the food was phenomenal simple but amazing by far the best restaurant breakfast i ve had in years
1754,too anxious to wait for the 20 week ultrasound to tell the gender of my baby i went online and found womb service who is able to provide the sex at just 15 weeks the studio is easy to get to and looks like someone s house from the outside inside you re welcomed into a small waiting room before you enter the private ultrasound room the entire studio is modern and comfortable with plenty of seating for you and whoever you choose to bring along the experience itself was amazing we worked with jana who explained the process before starting the ultrasound once she started she kindly explained everything we were seeing on the screen and printed plenty of pictures for us to take home i highly recommend womb service to anyone wanting to get a better look at their baby
1755,it looks like a french dollhouse my 5 year old daughter loves to watch them make cakes in the back great for very special occasions with immediate family and the cakes are good but i m not convinced it s 10 14 a slice good i actually prefer the taste of illinois street food emporium cakes at around 1 3 the price still awesome destination sweet shop to have in indy
1756,not too bad but pretty pricy for what it is basic fried fish hard to mess that up unless you re using bad fiah considering they are in the heart of the bayou i expected nothing less than fresh about 25 per person without alcohol
1757,wonderfully fresh sushi amazing lobster fried rice with tons of umami beautiful looking restaurant
1758,the atmosphere was nice we dined on the balcony but there were no lights so we were fortunate the sun had not completely set so we could read the menus food did take a long time to arrive the shrimp and crab cake sandwich was excellent the fried chicken sandwich was nothing special the chicken was good but the rest was just ok service was good and attentive however we were the only ones on the upper level so that was expected
1759,the food lacked flavor but everything else was great the presentation is near perfect and the location decor are spot on
1760,loved every bit of the sushi and the options were outstanding considering i m from cali and sushi rose is a place that i ll hold close to my heart when i cruz by here again to reno aaa
1761,a great meal that my family really enjoyed you can tell that the management and the staff here really care about delivering an exceptional dining experience steaks were seasoned perfectly and grilled exactly how we asked they have a fun tuesday night kids theme 1 99 kids meal with a drink what a deal with a mascot roaming the restaurant face painting and a ice cream topping bar better get there early to get a table as the crowd waiting as we left tells me the word s out about this great family restaurant in a sea of horrific chains texas roadhouse in sicklerville is head and shoulders above the rest
1762,thai place is one of our favorite restaurants staff is very friendly and attentive we always order and enjoy spring rolls chicken satay pad thai pad see yew panang curry and if in season mango sticky rice delicious
1763,i just had the best car buying experience of my life and it s all thanks to jonathan plasky the amazing team at crown honda thanks to jonathan s outstanding customer service skills i will never buy another vehicle from anyone but jonathan at crown honda jonathan is the nicest guy you ll ever meet he s friendly knowledgeable professional technical and down to earth he goes above and beyond to assure you have an exceptional car buying experience i was given a great deal on my honda pilot and couldn t be happier jonathan and the team will make you feel like family i can honestly say that this was actually the best customer service experience i have had anywhere ever i highly recommend that you buy your next vehicle from jonathan plasky at crown honda call 1 866 202 4593 and ask for him i promise you you won t be disappointed
1764,thoroughly enjoyed it chicken biriyani had boneless meat which is always nice spice level was just above mild chicken tikka masala had a nice warm flavor the garlic naan was just ok didn t taste fresh but if you dunk it in sauce it s just fine
1765,yummy lemon drops the frenchy is good too we had two free drink coupons from our hotel and we are glad that we did friendly bartender nice atmosphere
1766,barrio brewing and their university imprint gentle ben s are like the 1993 honda civic of the tucson beer scene there is nothing particularly snazzy about them but they are reliable industrial and get the job done the barrio blonde and citrazona are perhaps their best known but i also enjoy the copper pale and the rojo red ale the latter are not sold in cans but you can have growlers filled just make sure that your growler doesn t have any stickers or logos on it they ve also got a full bar where they really knock it out of the park is the food over the course of the dozen or so times i ve been here not one menu item has disappointed some favorites are the lizzy salad buffalo chicken sandwich ask for the gorgonzola cream on the side so that you don t get a moist sandwich and the chips and guacamole again i can t say i ve ever thought oh my god i really need a barrio beer right now but the quality of the food friendliness of the service and enjoyable ambiance are what keep me coming back
1767,great service the people who work here make us feel like friends meeting up their prices portions and food are the best that i ve seen so far for downtown indy
1768,good food friendly folks don t come in full quick and good portions get the tips seating outside
1769,finally experienced terra sur it is questionable as to why i have not eaten here yet since i have heard sooooo many great things so finally my boyfriend and i stopped in on labor day for a good dinner we were seated right away and i really enjoyed the paintings and atmosphere all over the restaurant it s a romantic warm welcoming atmosphere for dinner we ordered the jalea mix the tallarin verde while waiting for our food we were brought some hot delicious bread which was wonderful because i was starving and who doesn t love being served bread our food came out shortly after the pasta was out of this world but my boyfriend wasn t crazy about his steak it was a little more cooked than what he had asked for and as for my jalea the fish was a little on the colder side but flavor wise everything was delicious and portion size was wonderful as well i m sure we ll eventually be back to bring my parents
1770,all the crepes i ve tried are fantastic the coffee is very good though i wish they had larger sizes available looks tiny from the outside there is comfortable seating in the basement
1771,the shrimps were really good and the service was okay one tip is order right away after being seated in that way you wouldn t wait another 30 45minutes for your order luckily for our table we didn t wait that long as i did order right away the place was really busy and the queue was still really long after we finished our meal
1772,a fantastic surprising discovery the last time i got takeout pizza a couple years ago this place just had a counter now it s a beautiful dine in restaurant complete with large local draft beer menu a varied menu and gluten free crust so good charming old b w family photos on all the walls delightful service excellent pizza great we ll be back
1773,best hummus in the world i come here almost every week and i am always loving it friendly people great food yum yum
1774,let me tell you the beignets here are incredibly awesome they are so light and fluffy that we had to come back again tonight to take them back to our hotel room it is my understanding that they are made to order we went to another very famous place and had coffee and beignets after having the beignets here yesterday absolutely no comparison cafe beignet knows how to make beignets the live entertainment is impressive this is a nice place to relax and enjoy coffee and beignets i will always come here instead of the other place you must give it a try,let me tell you the beignets here are incredibly awesome they are so light and fluffy that we had to come back again tonight to take them back to our hotel room it is my understanding that they are made to order we went to another very famous place and had coffee and beignets after having the beignets here yesterday absolutely no comparison cafe beignet knows how to make beignets the live entertainment is impressive this is a nice place to relax and enjoy coffee and beignets i will always come here instead of the other place you must give it a try
1775,this place is wonderful obviously the chips salsa and beans are yummy but get the guacamole too the chimichanga bites are fantastic whatever the sauce is that comes with them is super good for dinner the street tacos are amazing so are the enchiladas they don t have a full bar but you can still get a real margarita and they pack a punch they make them at their other location and bring them over which is clever because this location doesn t yet have its liquor license overall 4 out 5 stars because it s a good mexican restaurant but 5 stars is reserved for my most favorites only close second though and we love that it s right downtown oh and the service very good we usually always have the same server and she is very nice and attentive
1776,saw the reviews on yelp and had to try it as we were looking for a breakfast place while making a pit stop in nashville where do i start the mimosas were strong the waitress was warm upbeat and very inviting the food was delish and filling i had the veggie burrito it was plentiful and tasty my mates had the bacon egg and cheese biscuit and another the waffle the waffle and biscuit was a little heavy but overall good we also split a cinnamon roll that was very good we left full and sated definitely worth a visit
1777,the ice cream is really good and the staff is very friendly
1778,loved it can t wait to go back the service was great the food spectacular coffee yes please
1779,my wife and i love this store she bought a sequin jacket for our wedding here great place to find deals on frye boots
1780,amazing service we used allyson krebs as our re agent to sell our home in nashville it was an investment property and we had moved to mt there s so much to do in getting a house ready for sale and being remote owners we were a little anxious about how we could coordinate all of the repairs cleaning etc that was required just to be show ready allyson went above and beyond our expectations in handling the details and ensuring the property was ready to show with a compressed timeline house sold within days well above asking price couldn t have asked for a better experience
1781,zio s previously known as cesarina s is a largo staple this little bakery italian bistro is a marvel that must be experienced to be understood when i tell you that the sandwiches are the size of your arm i am not joking should you get a meatball sub the meatballs are the size of croquet balls juicy and delicious zio s has about everything a guy could hope for in an italian shop
1782,got the santa barbara local omelette with hashbrowns and toast and it was damn good i did ask for extra salsa which definitely heightened the experience portions are massive and i got a huge dollop of butter that i didn t even come close to finishing overall a cool spot with a comfy local vibe these are the kinds of places where you find the best breakfast
1783,service was excellent the black bacon and the corn beef hash were outstanding i would have given five stars but may over easy eggs were hard cooked i would definitely give this place another try
1784,the food was just okay i had much higher hopes for this place on the other hand the service and wait staff is friendly
1785,get a bloody mary stay for the food this was one of the best food spots we hit up on our trip to new orleans i m glad we were tipped off to this place food was excellent and the brunch cocktails to die for not embarrassed to say we wanted to come back several more times
1786,great food great customer service amazing coffee great for business meeting brunch with friends romantic dinner and breakfast with a big family alike very spacious clean and welcoming,clean bright welcoming coffee shop with nice coffee and some bakery items the location is beautiful as well old city of
1787,love this place everyone is always friendly fast drinks food always good it s a great hangout chill place
1788,wow was i late to the party on this one i drove by it for months not realizing they had additional parking in a lot beside the restaurant from the front this place looks small and the front parking lot is usually packed when you get inside the place is deep and opens to a huge back lot we ate and drank in the beer garden area outside it was huge the tacos were great and some of the best guacamole i have had in nashville decent beer list which i hope they will continue to expand and very good service
1789,i really wanted to like this place since there are no thai restaurants to speak of on the east side the food wasn t bad it was just okay the spring rolls were average but the pad thai was disappointing the flavoring was on the bland side and very watery if i were already at the mall i would give them another try but definitely not something i would go out of my way for
1790,awesome loved this place great little breakfast joint easy walk south of route 90 easy walk from french quarter and surrounding areas we got the bananas foster and it was incredible great decorations and colorful setting that feels like how you d expect new orleans to feel highly recommend
1791,ate here again tonight everything delicious the place was packed my margarita was superb i m going to come back with several more people and try the paradia sonorense which looked and smelled wonderful,you know it s pretty good i have to say there s really only one dish it s a noodle bowl you make up by selecting ingredients on your way in includes white rice soup and bread if you want i found the ingredients are fresh and the portion is huge,not bad in one of the less expensive places you can eat at downtown it s basically a knockoff of but the food was very good and the quality i think was better than you get from the chains
1792,awesome place good food and service shrimp and grits are to die for pancakes are really good to
1793,this is one of favorites in kirkwood my go to happy hour all night btw date night or book club with the girls the service drinks and food never disappoint the pours are very generous i hesitate to even tell you how awesome it is because i don t want it too get too popular
1794,i have been here couple times and i have always really enjoyed my sandwich i have only tried their vegetarian sandwiches but i find them one of the most unique and flavourful sandwiches out there they re not your typical grilled veggie sandwich like every other sandwich shop has they really put thought into them and they are always a treat the service is fast and friendly and there is a small patio you can enjoy in the summer,i have been going here for many months now i do the mama and baby fitness class it s a great full body workout and you can have your baby either sit with you carried them in a carrier or have them chill out in the car seat or the can walk around it s a small gym with a chilled out atmosphere and limited parking there is street parking but i would give yourself some extra minutes to find a spot you can get a punch pass or even use your fitset to join glasses,coffee and rescue cats make a wonderful combination a great caf with delicious coffee and a small selection of treats i got the mint oreo cookie brownie and it was off the hook delicious they also have a nice selection of teas hot chocolate etc they also have cool cat gifts cat champagne the cats are in a different room that is monitors by chaperone which is such a good idea to make sure everyone is treating the cats well and also she will tell you about any cat in the room the owners of the caf are very friendly and very passionate about what they do to date they have already rehomed over 30 cats what a wonderful cause i would highly recommend this place
1795,my boyfriend and i had a great first experience here i went on a sunday night i believe because they opened late with serving crawfish there s not much room for seating inside but at the time there was a local band playing so we sat in the patio area the atmosphere was great along with the food will definitely come again
1796,and in fact i did go back again i wanted to try the beef ribs dinner it appears they marinate beef short ribs and then broil them to order over mesquite wood waitress asked how i wanted them prepared though she was a little vague normally i am a medium rare kind of guy got five ribs actually 2 5 ribs since they were cut in half the meat had a great flavor thought this type of preparation causes shrinkage a very good change of pace served with salad choice of tortillas and beans a note they offer a drive thru window
1797,this place was awesome i can t believe we found this gem of a italian restaurant not downtown the service was good the food was spectacular i had the shrimp and lobster stuffed ravioli in alfredo sauce delicious i will absolutely be returning sooner than later
1798,everyone knows that the unique donuts and beer at district are unmatched but there are so many awesome surprises on their menu today i tried their sack lunch it came with two good sized beef sliders and an entire basket of waffle fries with a drink it was only 8 and a half bucks usually around 10 because of my gf s teacher discount i think the price was totally warranted and i might have a new menu favorite when i go in a lot of people don t know about the seating out back but with an awesome music selection it s the perfect place to grab a bite and chill out another solid shout out is that their tea is not the usually lipton special that sits in a jug all day there is a definite herbal fresh taste that totally unexpected the atmosphere food and people create the totally package and it s the reason they always get five star ratings
1799,veronica from alterations was absolutely amazing she made me feel so comfortable had me laughing and even let me take a sit down break in the middle of alterations lol she was very kind and understanding i would definitely recommend seeing her
1800,not bad at all i ve gotten my eyelashes done here several times and every time they ve looked great they do really cool decisions and the pedicures are good as well i tried my first 3d flower nail designs here and they came out so cuteee the only reason why i gave a 4 5 is because the time before last i went they rushed through my pedicure and i had an inconsistent paint application which has never happened to me before here i paid walked out and walked right back in after i seen outside in the light and their response was to come back tomorrow because it was 7 05 and they close at 7
1801,i went here twice both times had excellent service the food was great i got the veggie wrap on time that was good second time i had pancakes they were little to much flour in it to my liking the cakes were like 1 4 thick other than that it was good i do see myself coming back here again
1802,an uber driver by the name of daniel came to our rescue a few days ago in channelside tampa and we will never forget this man s kindness and generosity i took a bad fall on the sidewalk and had a large gash on my forehead as well as a fractured wrist he pulled over and assisted me to my feet he was so compassionate and calm in handling my fall and even drove my husband and me to the closest er all at his own expense daniel gave up his time to help us in our time of need we were complete strangers and we were so fortunate that he stopped to help what a wonderful asset to uber this man is
1803,come hungry and early it get crowded especially on sundays where people come after church get the buffet meals so you can taste a little bit of everything the staff are so warm and welcoming and the food is so good especially the fried chicken and gumbo when you sit outside and eat expect flies or bugs flying around because it attracts food but it is part of the experience especially in the south will come back again definitely
1804,stromboli 7 95 look at the size of this and with traditional ny style bread for app we had homemade meatballs and sauce which were delicious the ribeye steak was a nice cut of meat with a side of potatoes that were deliciously crunchy we are definitely coming back to this place with great food that doesn t break the bank
1805,i love greek food zorba s tavern is byob has a lovely patio area where you can people watch while enjoying the atmosphere be careful with the mosquitos they ll eat you alive out there we enjoyed the charcoaled sampler for two for 37 pork kabob chicken kabob marinated chicken breast two rack lamb chops homemade sausage and gyro meat which is the perfect thing to share and try a little of everything although it was delicious i couldn t get over the very high cost of the meals they will run you 15 25 on average per entree and the ambience quality did not really match the price
1806,brillman s did an excellent job with our wedding rentals i ll admit communication can be painfully slow but at the end of the day they supplied everything we needed for our outdoor wedding including tent tables chairs tablecloths tableware bars cooks tent and more they are seasoned pros and everything went off without a hitch our wedding was absolutely gorgeous thank you
1807,if you are in tampa and haven t visited al s then you are missing out the staff is very nice all of the food is good the desserts are to die for we came in and it was busy but they were prepared for it and their service was very friendly and fast from the time we parked til the time we left i love bbq and i made it a priority to stop at al s during my weekend in tampa you won t regret it try jt out
1808,this is a great festival lots of choices for breweries i didn t count how many but there had to be at least 50 breweries showcased each seem to have a great selection of beers that would please the palette of various people if you like local beers this is the festival for you upon entering you get a keepsake 3 oz glass for sampling the beers which is enough to get the taste of the beer and enjoy it as well food choices were a little bit limited in my opinion but overall it was a great time
1809,i love milk and honey big sign right in front walking inside to see some great designing the store build out is very clean and great attention to detail the menu ranges from brunch items to cold pressed juices we got the fried chicken biscuit and the mean green juice it was really good the biscuit nice and fluffy chicken juicy and crispy the juice was lightly sweet i would definitely recommend this spot for brunch recommendation fried chicken biscuit mean green cold press juice
1810,our waitress kam was amazing and our food was delicious the manager john made sure to stop by our table and wish my friend a happy birthday we ll be back
1811,yum i grew up in tucson and love this place now live in phoenix and when visiting tucson i ll swing by for some quarts and tortillas to go delicious love the red chili green chili and the beans and salsa oh and the tortillas are the best
1812,only eaten here once the food was good traditional menu with some stir fry items service was good also i had the pho with all the variety of meats the beef tendon was not what i was use to
1813,i ordered red snapper peas and rice cabbage the red snapper was made fresh and worth every bit the wait the peas rice were very good and the cabbage with a mixed vegetable medley was nutritious and tasty the portions were very generous i was concerned about parking as there wasn t any the first time i drove around i called and was told it was okay to park at the mechanic next door the owner was friendly and very personable i ll definitely be back again fish lovers should remember to call ahead so that your fish can be prepared i really like that the fish is made to order i ll definitely be back to try out other dishes
1814,we have eaten here many times food is fresh have never had a bad thing ever that is saying a lot since we eat here almost every week
1815,really impressed with my meal here came in around 8pm on a saturday night and we were able to get seats at the bar in front of the kitchen got the beef skewer and corn skewer both were fantastic beef was tender and i liked how they had coarse sea salt crystals on the side corn was perfectly grilled and had good seasoning on it also nice that it came with two pieces of corn instead of just one i ordered the shio ramen the noodles were perfectly cooked and there was a nice thick piece of tender pork belly broth was a little thicker than i m used to also wish they had a pork broth because it s a little weird eating pork with chicken broth the skewers were probably better than the ramen but the ramen was still pretty good service was fine and it was cool to see them preparing the food i was actually surprised how good the food was because none of the chefs cooks in the kitchen were asian except maybe one could ve been part asian overall i was really impressed with my meal and would definitely eat here again
1816,i have always passed by this restaurant since we live in downtown and often come to the casinos i remember this being by the caricature man by the escalators very noticeable with its welcoming music we went during dinner time and it was fairly busy i wish we were sat inside than the outdoor area open to the people and casino part i rather would have sat inside with the darker environment fit to its theme there are regular and higher tables and chairs for food we got burnt ends for an appetizer cajun fettuccine and double stack burger for entrees the portions are great we even had left overs burnt ends were delicious i wish it had more the burger was incredible grilled cheese sandwiches with a burger patty in the middle genius pasta were very good as well i really enjoyed the food and price is reasonable as for customer service our waitress was incredibly nice and accommodating however she did forget a few things that we asked for such as more sauce a plastic bag and our credit card back it was really busy so no big deal
1817,good location for a decent uber to the french quarter staff seemed friendly enough place was nicelt decorated and the room was very clean pool was tiny but pretty couldn t really enjoy swimming because there were wasps everywhere the restaurant had great food service was good overall it was a pretty good stay only issue we had was every morning between 7am and 9am housekeeping was out in the hallway and super loud we forgot to out out the do not disturb sign one day and a maid knocked on our door at 845 to clean even without that disturbance it was super hard to sleep in as the noise in the hallways was loud
1818,i m one of the dunedin residents that actually welcomes change in dunedin and there s some changes here all good ones in my opinion there s too many options around us for reuben grouper or fried grouper or grouper period if you care about healthy fish stocks in our water order fish specials like cobia or corvina when restaurants run them or we will overfish poor grouper so we ordered charcuterie the brussels sprouts chicken wings and tuna dinner to share every dish was fantastic i ask for the sauce on the side for the wings because it s braised then fried so you end up with fall off the bone meat and extremely crispy chicken wings and dammit finally someone has great wings in dunedin the tuna was perfectly seared with bok choy which no one besides the chinese restaurant serves a lot of their dishes comes with their delicious kim chi i love love it it could be spicier but it s tasty regardless i ordered the special which was a seafood squid ink pasta and it s too die for and the chef made the pasta from scratch i think residents that embrace new life faces in dunedin and creativity with quality food you need to come in and try it we had great service and fantastic martinis as well they ve expanded the patio which had live music outside it was perfect for my friends birthday and management made sure to take care of us as well as their staff i love what they re doing and hope more people embrace change love seeing new things in dunedin i vote the chef continue to try new food this foodie welcomes it especially if you know what you re doing
1819,if you want authentic mexican cuisine this is a one stop shop from the restaurant to the butcher to the fresh corn tortillas and tamales they can meet any craving you have btw the orchata is amazing
1820,i love panera but today i was really disappointed i ordered the chicken salad with almonds what i got was a tomato lettuce and maybe a tablespoon of chicken salad it did not even cover the bread i also ordered a salad but i have not eaten it yet i usually order the turkey bacon and avocado sandwich which is so good i will tell you to go to arby s if you want a really good chicken salad sandwich the filling falls out of the bread they use pecans instead of almonds which i don t think i even found one in this sandwich i will go back but i will never order this sandwich again
1821,we just moved from california and my car was really hairy from transporting pets after it was cleaned looks like a new car thanks
1822,ryan and team are great they helped us through the entire process of purchasing hardwood flooring for our new home and even helped get the wood to us faster than we expected so we could finish the job sooner i would recommend going to lumber liquidators for your flooring needs and make sure to ask for ryan he is knowlegable professional and will help you find success on your next project
1823,this was a wonderful sushi experience i went with the sampler the sushi chef guided me through each piece from how to place the fish on my tongue to the various sensations very minimalistic which i enjoyed
1824,brian was straight awesome dude knows his new orleans history and told some very historical tales i d definitely take a tour from him and voodoo bone lady again
1825,this is amazing food i had a ginger cauliflower non dairy soup and the black bean empanadas we shared the tostadas so good
1826,greatest version of an egg mcmuffin ever my daughter ordered it with a runny fried egg and cheddar cheese plus crispy cherry smoked bacon we happened in at 8am after dropping a car for repairs two blocks up the street wonderful staff lots of healthy options but i could still get coffee the prices are a bit high but the portions are very generous
1827,love this place very knowledgeable professional accommodating and fair i had a loose aquamarine that i needed a setting for and noman knew exactly how to make it look fantastic the jeweler did a phenomenal job setting the stone and it turned out beautiful i m very happy with the whole experience if you re looking for something unique or want to put your own personal touches on a piece this is the place to go
1828,delicious pizza wings phillies and fries dad and i love coming here for lunch or for a drink this place has been our go to when we don t feel like cooking i am a huge fan of the bbq chicken pizza jalepeos and all every time i have ordered a beer it is always crisp and ice cold the only thing i would change is the cubicle partitions in the women s restroom there is way too much of a gap between the floor and the panels which doesn t offer very much privacy i m picky about public restrooms and i hate knowing that someone sitting on a toilet several stalls over can actually lean over and see the tops of the neighboring toilets
1829,best dinner meal wife and i have had in a long time boar was awesome pork chop fantastic great service and cool atmosphere
1830,absolutely fell in love i was visiting philly for a few days and asked around for a healthy food option and was pointed to essene omg the customer service food cleanliness and available products were all awesome i ve shared the website with others and can t recommend the cafe enough you ll love it,really great customer service food and coffee as a side note i left my ray bans behind and had already flown back to california before i remembered where they might be i called toscana s and they offered to mail the glasses to me at their own expense certainly would have written a 5 star review regardless but with customer service like that i definitely wanted to give them a shout out
1831,this place is super cute and rustic love the vibe and the service all over their workers have such great personalities it made the experience that much better and they were super accommodating too when i asked if i could bring a cake in there for my boyfriends birthday i had their london fog and my boyfriend had the chai my boyfriend said it was one of his favourite chai he s ever had and he only gets chai when we go to cafes it was really good the spices of the drinks really shine through it was a great experience
1832,best place for sushi the chop chop cones and the california rolls are amazing one of our go to places for sushi in edmonton for sure try to make your reservations early the restaurant gets full early
1833,really good sno balls super friendly service best part it is a drive thru nice way to cool off in this ridiculous heat
1834,spent a few hours here on a beautiful sunday afternoon and frankly could have easily spent several more well worth venturing a little out of the way to find this one of a kind venue between the excellent live music diverse wine selection and overall good vibes one would be hard pressed to not enjoy themselves here my girlfriend and i showed up around 2 45 pm and the place was already quite crowded although the line to get in was not very long while we were not able to get a table and chairs immediately we hung out in the standing room area and then moved in on a table when one opened up we ended up sharing the table with another group whose company we quite enjoyed it s that kind of place while we were not looking for food when we got there all the food being delivered to tables looked very good we ended up ordering one of their small plates just to try and it was delicious if we lived in new orleans i have no doubt that we would be a frequent visitors highly recommended
1835,if it s sunday and the old folks are in town parents in laws grandparents etc then the obvious choice is mcl they always have great home cooked meals that seem to accommodate a wide variety of tastes my favorite entree is the chicken and noodles with green beans and mashed potatoes the service is cafeteria style but waiters waitresses come around and fill up your drinks this is a great restaurant to visit if you are looking for a good hearty meal
1836,had breakfast with the family after a quick stopover great food and service thanks jonathan definaelty a good find that was busy but had no wait on a saturday
1837,the fish hoagie is amazing i wasn t even mad when they messed up my order i asked for fried onions and mayo only but they made it their way it was great both times i ve had it i also tasted my daughter s wing platter with mac and cheese and string beans i don t eat mac and cheese but the string beans were bomb the kid loved it all so i d say the mac was good
1838,i have been three times and have tried the onion rings burger fries bacon wrapped hamburger steak with mashed potatoes and the chicken parmesan they were all good but i was very pleased with the chicken parmesan tasty and plenty of it could split it with someone
1839,one word custard yum i got the southern pecan and my date got the turtle and the southern pecan was the obvious winner it was so good it deserves 5 stars but the lack of flavor in the turtle was disappointing the place was pretty packed but there weren t any lines so it worked out great best part is when they flip it upside down to show you it s some real true custard
1840,first time here and the service was astounding then the food came and followed up on the promise of the service calamari was excellently cooked and the marinara was a perfect side the bell peppers and artichoke hearts with it was a great addition the greek salad was elegant and simple which is deceptively hard to nail the margherita pizza is fresh crisp and delicious if ever i return to the area i m coming for seconds
1841,so happy with my first experience here came today saturday around 5 for my first sns mani they have so many color options and the woman really took her time to make my nails perf
1842,i ve been to at least three locations in the reno sparks area but this one is the most consistent across three stylists so far by checking in online the long wait times are a thing of the past i had albany for the first time not too long ago and she did great kaylin is usually my go to i can have difficult hair to fade for a lot of people but kaylin does an excellent job every time she s very professional and always makes sure my cut is right i m glad she s moving on up
1843,been here twice and both times we thoroughly enjoyed our visit staff was very friendly and attentive and had great knowledge and the menu and provided some good suggestions food was delicious and portions are hefty so no need to worry about going home hungry it does tend to get s little loud especially on sundays and the space is a little more industrial and cold but that s just something to play into your personal preference give it a try
1844,great place with great food service the location was clean and quiet great for a morning wake up breakfast both the hyatt and the fat rooster staff were very friendly and the breakfast buffet had a lot of healthy choices organic yogurt tons of fresh berries fresh fruit and made to order omelette served by a very friendly gentleman that greeted us when we stepped up to the omelette bar overall excellent experience and would visit again
1845,oh man this joint right here has some of the most explosive authentic flavors in reno my girlfriend and i sat down at 7pm sharp with no wait on tuesday our server was manuel who absolutely crushed it we have multiple beers from the delicious sculpin ipa to the local brown ale started with the edamame and pork dumplings both very good next had ahi poke and steak which was nicely cooked and had onions paired with the steak a great touch breast and wing yakatori in the middle of all this before i forget absolutely fire we will be back
1846,fun place with interesting menu of you should try this once service was good great attitude from all the staff enjoyed breakfast before checking out the jonny cash museum
1847,absolutely fabulous stay at the loews hotel philadelphia the service was fantastic room was clean had a great view it was my boyfriend and i s anniversary and the hotel gave us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries at no extra charge my boyfriend spoke with concierge kimmy and she made everything so special they even put rose petals on our bed while we were out at dinner would definitely recommend to a friend and we will definitely be coming back to stay again
1848,ashley is truly the best pet sitter we have ever had she takes such great care of our babies they are comfortable and well taken care of when we return from vacation its is so comforting to be able to go away and know that our family is in the best hands and being loved and treated well thank you so much we really appreciate all that you do
1849,this hole in the wall is fire it was hard choosing from their extensive menu in the end i enjoyed the garlic parmesan wings and crinkled fries with nacho cheese the wings are cooked to perfection crispy on the outside and tender on the inside we ate here yesterday and we ll be paying another visit before we leave nola this place is better than any of the major wings places you ve ever visited try it
1850,i ve had many cars done here quick and efficient it doesn t get any better than this great deal perfect job every time
1851,we had a family celebration for a very special family member and were looking for a restaurant where we could have a private room and serve 50 people on a saturday night while offering variety and service at a reasonable price not an easy task however our experience at spero s filled the bill in every way possible the service and attention to detail was scrupulous the food and choices were beautifully presented and excellent in taste from beginning to end the room we were provided and the dedicated staff made it a seamless night from pre dinner drinks and hors doerves to the quiet we needed for some toasts thru till the very end it is hard to have an event that would fit our needs in terms of service food and pricing but spero s provided it 5 as a regular visitor to st louis i am looking forward to returning to enjoy a meal in the main dining room but know that if anyone asks where they should host a dining event that they can be proud to have hosted i cannot recommend spero s highly enough true professionalism thank you spero s for making a wonderful event a reality
1852,great sales team and informative employees jonnette was great and helped us a lot with financing options
1853,food was excellent and very authentic a lot of vegan options will definitely be eating here again
1854,the food was amazing you could definitely taste that the food was made with fresh ingredients the prices were fair and it was great to getaway from the hustle of the french quarter
1855,i absolutely love this place i love the decor i felt like i was in in an absolutely whimsical place the uniforms by the staff in the pinks and grays with the khaki pants that are clearly label the cake bake shop it was just wonderful the service was fantastic although we had a small hiccup which i will explain but it was just wonderful the desserts were delicious they were absolutely incredible i actually want to open one of these myself in california but i understand there is only one there s not a franchise with a second coming soon in carmel which i assume is in indiana the shop is going to be very very busy soon as oprah is going to be featuring the bake shop in her own magazine next month so what did we have an absolutely delicious carrot cake a fabulous slice of carmel cake and a cup of smores hot chocolate we took out son a lemon bar and snickerdoddle bar to go he said they were yummy too we thoroughly enjoyed the desserts and service i will go back because the concept and the desserts were great ok so our hiccup we came in were given a 5 able told the lady that we wanted to go look in dessery cabinets first she said of course and showed us where our table would be after looking through the restaurant in awe we went to sit down and another african american couple was sitting at the table the greeter asked me could she help me and i said that was out table she had obviously confused one african american couple with another my husband and i just looked at each other and shook our heads we ended up sitting at the counter which ended up being fine but the young lady obviously realized what she had done i could take a couple of stars off for this but perhaps this will educate the employee on unconscious bias
1856,wish i knew about this place before i found this place in yelp while i was scrolling for a nearby brunch spot this place had so many good reviews and located next to cafe la maude which i was not impressed at all so i gave this place a shot and i am glad i did at first it s a really small and tight place but the inside decor is really nice with a lot of natural light the food is amazing i had the breakfast bomb with bacon it is really interesting how they incorporate the pancake with the meal and use it differently it s def a must try dish also the coffee there is amazing i absolutely love this place,i came here one saturday to see what all the fuss is about donuts were pretty good now i m not into donuts and the sweets but the donut was pretty good the coffee was mediocre for me
1857,yum o we spend the day in tarpon springs and headed here around 3 45 for lunch dinner we waited for about 10 minutes for our table and were seated this restaurant has a ton of staff and they are always running around our waiter was nice and quick we ordred gyro yum chicken slouvaki yum spanokopita yes this is what i ordered good but the top filo dough crust was a bit harder than i like hotdog this is what the 5 year old got we also got an order of the cheese opa yes this will be our go to spot when we visit tarpon springs
1858,this hotel was nice for the price i stayed here one night this past weekend and i admittedly was not expecting it to be so nice the bathroom was clean and very modern the bed was comfortable with soft sheets and the a c worked well to beat the florida heat the floor to ceiling windows faced the building next door but we had a peek a boo view of the river walk see photo the valet guy was really nice and was willing to accommodate a guest i had coming to meet me next time i m in town this hotel will definitely be on my short list of places to stay especially if the rates are the same as what i paid this time the decor was really trendy and the art in the lobby was hip they have a nice cafe for breakfast and coffee we didn t have time to enjoy the pool or bar or other amenities but i did take a peek and they look really nice
1859,amazing loved this place first of all they allow dogs inside and second their bouquet latte was so so good i got it with oat milk instead of normal milk and i think it tasted better the latte was so pretty too they have dried flowers on it for decoration super unique and yummy will be back
1860,in response to doug f who posted a review just about an hour ago my husband and i were sitting right above you and your belligerent wife while she screamed in the manager s face slurring her words and threatening to post poor reviews all over social media we loved the dinnertime entertainment and the manager comped us nearly 20 off our meal because of the scene your wife caused and in front of your children no less it was great and our meal was absolutely amazing the service was great the view was fantastic and the food was delicious
1861,we came in late on a saturday night food was on point and i m always happy to see excel soda on the fountain nice space one calzone came out first because the other had a production issue but the delay wasn t long ok here s the best part of the visit since we were there right up to the last minute the crew was beginning pre close duties and were hustling to get it done the manager tony very professionally and tactfully told he crew to use care so as not to disturb the dining guests he was so low key about it but i heard him and it demonstrated that guest experience matters even at 10 30 on saturday night thanks sos
1862,wonderful wings we got the cajun creole lemon pepper cajun ranch and 0017 totally delish the ladies taking care of us made us feel right at home why i haven t come in sooner is a mystery to me don t make the same mistake come in and get these delicious wings with friendly service

1865,we have ordered twice now on caviar and the food has been extremely good obviously fresh ingredients great taste and tons of options i love that i can get something healthy or not
1866,this hotel was very conveniently located to all the things my husband and i needed to do in philly during our last visit there close to many historical sites some live music venues our friend s art gallery shopping and great food the doormen were always on top of their game never missed a beat i felt looked after and safe it was really easy to get a taxi or rideshare to and from the hotel inside the lobby was comfortable where i found a mix of tourists and business people the front desk and concierge were all smiles which is so appreciated and ever helpful i really felt like i was a regular treated with such kindness and respect and that they recognized me the elevators were quick and in good working condition our room was spacious clean and had a nice view of the boulevard though it was humid and hot outside it was nice and cool inside i appreciated that the desk working area was large and plentiful and i always appreciate hotel rooms where electrical outlets are placed thoughtfully i would definitely stay here again
1867,cherie is the bomb regarding cuts and color one happy customer i m always able to make a timely appt with her when you first get together she likes to be on the conservative on cut n color til she gets to really know her customer and their hair in the past i ve had a number of stylists who just keep cutting and cutting thinking their style would look better than what their customers want cherie is the opposite she really listens to her clients and what they want
1868,the service is good and the food is always fresh one of my favorite local sushi places
1869,the antipasta said was really nice great portion pizza crust is really good flavor could be a little better with the sauce
1870,everyone here was really polite and friendly i always order a chicken rice bowl with a side of chips i prefer qdoba s queso and guac to chipotle s their chips are not overly salty and have a nice lemon or lime zest to it which is refreshing
1871,wonderful place and great price i ve know ansen for more than a year now and he is a perfectionist never in a hurry even if he has a lot of appointments he will make sure he does a good job the new place is very clean and spacious i would definitely recommend this place to anyone
1872,we showed up with a group of 30 on saturday night and they could not have been nicer they let us rearrange some tables for our group the drinks were cold and strong the food was fried to perfection definitely a bit of a dive bar i read the review where the the guy was ordering martinis and laughed out loud

1879,beautiful trendy coffee bar that make you feel like you are in san francisco they have many delicious and unique lattes like the orange blossom or the lavender latte the batista was kind and welcoming music is a bit on the louder side by volume but it is not obtrusive at all i would consider this a great place to study
1880,this ship leaving from nola means you get a lot of southerners fine by me cruise director lee is so kind welcoming and engaging some odds and ends on the ship starting to show wear and tear the spa vip area is top notch try the most advanced steam room and the therapy spa if you need to sweat out the alcohol you enjoy throughout the trip bar staff at casino bar are top notch and remember your name by the end of day one shout out to gordana john ni made jargiver and my casino server vicktor and arnold ships layout is perfect for being in the action but also not too crowded location of alchemy in the area with the band and trivia games was a great call lanai hottubs are a nice touch too deck are awesome and you can go on the upper decks for a great view or lido and be in the action be ready to wobble and learn a couple line dances or two book this trip

1885,top hog has definitely become a victim of their own popularity i love the food and i would love to go here more often but i really don t want to fight the crowds they re always packed and we ve have to wait 15 minutes every time we ve gone i love the catfish and the pulled pork i always order mac and cheese and slaw as my sides which are absolutely killer the sweet tea is as big as your head
1886,first time here and i have to say that everything we tried was delicious was fortunate enough to catch happy hour so got to try a bunch items for a great price we had the bang bang shrimp dumplings baked oyster crawfish spring roll edamame pork belly buns chicken karage calamari and half priced mojitos
1887,we love coming here friendly staff and great options sometimes the line is long but it s expected when a new place is opening we come here frequently even our four year old loves this place definitely going to be loyal customers
1888,came here on vacation and had the doughnut burger dressed it was so good before leaving went back and got two more to go
1889,an expensive slightly more refined version of mcdonald s breakfasts salt content and all don t get me wrong it s tasty the same way mcdonald s is like i totally shouldn t be eating this but my mouth is saying yay so whatever just not sure it s really any better than typical fast food
1890,great vegetarian entrees definitely recommend the crudit appetizer warm aesthetic
1891,just back from my 2nd visit planning to return often this small friendly casual place has wonderful crepes both sweet savory portion size is good because every order is freshly made you might have to wait a bit but it s worth it they also sell nice looking baked goods which i haven t tried yet but will soon go there for a light meal or an indulgent dessert
1892,fabulous food longish wait on weekends no wonder only thing lacking is comfortable seating seafood is ultra fresh and delicious servers very knowledgeable and quick once you do get seated oysters any style and uni shooters delicious you will leave full and happy and how about that ocean view near sunset
1893,after hearing about this place from a fellow yelp elite my so and i decided to try this place we were warned of possible waiting times so came here on a saturday around 10 45 and a line was already forming for apps we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus the takoyaki are delicious an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle topped with sauces and squid flakes i definitely recommend this app as for the fried octopus it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side but it didn t come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in for ramen i got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my so got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen for both ramen the thin noodles were mushy overcooked and just didn t quite fit with the ramen that was the flaw with the dishes and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour y water so it wasn t as clean which explains the mushy feeling they should use more bouncy noodles for this now let s talk about the broth the broth is flavorful but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth i prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason overall delicious food and pricing is reasonable the decor is very nice as well but screaming kids that were running around didn t make our meal pleasant
1894,i heard this is the original habit so i had to try it not disappointed at all the charburger is excellent along with their fries bottomless drinks is a plus it s located in old town goleta with ample parking out back i can t stay if i like this more than in n out so i have to say i like this place just as much as in n out definitely my go to burger joint
1895,excellent service and good beer yazoo local beer plus the ny clam chowder and fish and chips are worth the visit
1896,after a long day at work the kids and i decided to stop at dots for a quick to go meal but ended up staying there to eat the staff was very welcoming and things felt like a nice extended family for the brief moment we were there the food had the same consistently as previous visits i wound definitely recommend for a nice hot affordable meal
1897,we hesitated to visit suegra based on the early reviews and boy are we glad we decided to give them a chance first and similar to other reviewers we went on a saturday night and it was 1 2 empty the restaurant itself has great ambiance wood beams very modern circular large bar as the focal point and a large chandelier with nice lighting we were seated promptly and server was very attentive starting us off immediately with the normal tortilla chips salsa however as an added bonus salsa was a 3 item sampler which we appreciated while we mulled the extensive and well designed cocktail menu most cocktails are tequila based shocking but had some great variations to the standard margarita we were a group of 3 and ordered guacamole app 1 order of the blackened grouper tacos 1 order of the barbacoa tacos and then 1 order of the enchilada duo and shared it all we didn t have a bad bite of food everything was very fresh well flavored and thoroughly enjoyed we will be back very soon though are a bit worried due to the early issues this restaurant clearly had that have to be impacting why they would be 1 2 empty on a saturday evening however they are very much on track now and strongly encourage you to give it a try prices are also very reasonable relative to quantity and portion and it s an incredibly welcome addition to the sea of tired chain restaurants in the area
1898,good luck getting something to eat here the service at the snack bar is bad today 9 3 18 only one person working a bunch of customers standing around no organized line no one knows who s next just a jumble of people the girl working doesn t seem to care people that came after me got helped first i got frustrated and walked away and left soon after to get food elsewhere
1899,delicious pizza true italian sauce we get this to go via a uber eats the meatball side order is fantastic top it all off with the homemade cannoli but be warned the cannolis sell out so reserve yours early
1900,i decided to visit this place after i was doing a research about an indoor park close to me with all the thunderstorms that have been happening around the city i opted for this park we got there around 1pm and since the sun was out i rented an outdoor cabana which brings 4 water bottle for free and a service lady which was very courteous we were 4 adults and one child and the service was great we were very close to the wave pool which i liked the most from the rest of the pool the life savers makes an outstanding job watching all the kids and they have lots of restrictions from what you can do or can t do my friends tried some of the sliders a few times my boyfriend tried the surfing pool which was really cool and we all tried the lazy river as well they have restroms in the outside which is less crowded than the inside ones we didnt rent no locker since we had the cabana and most of the people who were sitting in the outside area seems like they didnt as well food was great and affordable i got to drink a daiquiri for 8 dollars and at first i thought it didn t have no alcohol since it didn t taste like it had some i believe that they don t put too much alcohol in the other drinks as well since they know that most people come here driving etc we spent the rest of the day going from one pool to the other and we all loved even my child was so happy we didn t try the arcade room cause the ac was so high and it felt chill in the inside downsides they are very restrictive with the food i got it tickets in here are not as expensive as other parks and you want people to invest in the food but ya ll have to put in mind that not all kids eat chickens and pizza and second my friend have a very restrictive diet from her nutritionist she doesn t eat salad because everything she eats she have to buy it from the meal plan they didn t let her bring her food in and she have to opt for eating a salad plus the guy that was checking the bags told her that he was gonna let him bring the water bottle really this really pissed me off another downside all the sliders are in the indoor side and the indoor side had so much clorox inside that our eyes were itching and red aside from these downsides i feel like i possibly come back to this place just because my child enjoyed it
1901,i was in town from chicago visiting a friend who is new to the city we were looking for a place to have brunch and i instantly recognized milktooth as i read about it in food wine and couldn t forget the unique name we walked in about 2 15 on a wednesday and although they closed at 3 the staff were perfectly kind and accommodating and the restaurant had a few tables full i instantly loved the kitschy decor and airy space i got the cold brew and it was so refreshing my friend and i split the grilled cheese the burger and a grapefruit pastry it was all so amazing but the grilled cheese was definitely the stand out for me it was the perfect combination of salty and sweet and unlike anything i ve ever tasted although the idea seems so simple the burger was delicious as well but was missing a little something in the flavor the of patty the pastry was absolutely perfect and it doesn t hurt that it s citrus season i d definitely go back the next time i m in town to try the crispy cauliflower wedge and dutch baby to name a few living in chicago some of the best restaurants are just outside my door but i have to say i was seriously impressed with this place and the grilled cheese was among one of the best things i ve put in my mouth
1902,i m going to start with omg the food was amazing i gave the 5 stars but the service is about 3 5 they are a little slow coming to the table to check you out but elias really good about getting the orders in and getting the food out i will be visiting this spot in the future i really don t know what else to add
1903,very cute place 3 5 nice variety of sweet and savory crepes if you eat in you order upstairs and they bring you your food to your table at a more spacious downstairs eating area
1904,busy but quick and fast service with deliciously thick custard i had the turtle and it was everything i thought it would be sweet smooth with a bit of crunch this place is a st louis staple
1905,i am originally from the lehigh valley and had an amazing authentic taco place in bethlehem called aqu es and it was rated 2 in the nation taqueria el jalapeno is definitely the closest to mexican authentic i have had here in the philly burbs since moving and it s a walk from my home in bridgeport daily fresh juices and the lengua was superb highly recommend and they take credit cards
1906,best brunch in town their drinks and pastries are amazing their sweet potato hash is my favorite breakfast option
1907,alexis made my day she was so polite and i was having a bad day but she made it all better the food is good too but i ll be back just for the customer service she deserves a raise i had an everything bagel with plain cream cheese incredibly delicious i am way too happy over just a bagel because it s not just a bagel of 4 or so coffee shops on euclid kaldis starbucks coffee cartel this is my favorite it just has such a nice atmosphere the room to the side is perfect today is a rainy day and hazelnut coffee just hits the spot absolutely love this place then again i m a sucker for coffee shops no idea why it has less than 4 stars easily a 5 star place for me and i rate mostly on how much you get for your money customer service food quality
1908,pita jungle has some of the tastiest food especially for the healthy conscious been here a few times ordered lunch one time and everything went smoothly also been here for team lunches this time for my daughter who has never dined here started with the cilantro jalapeo hummus why would you not we ordered the lavish turkey pewrap and a lamb gyro can i just say the lamb had a crispiness that added a ton of flavor the amount of sauce was just right and let it be known that you could taste the freshness in every bite i tasted the wrap and it too was crispy and full of flavor we sat out on the patio first time for me usually i don t like to sit on the patios i feel like i might be missed or forgotten but not here service was spot on and everything came out as asked even down the lemon i asked for in my water really good and impressed with all
1909,if you care about what you put in your body and like food that is well thought out this is a place for you big bonus fantastic beer where can you go for great beer and food that is made with a conscience the fries were crispy burger oh so juicy and delicious hot chicken sandwich amazing all locally sourced this place deserves a real certification https eatreal org
1910,so i ve only had the tacos and flan here i had 3 different types of tacos carne asada pollo and fish i garnished them with a healthy smattering of the salsa and it was super hot maybe it was made with an habanero pepper for my gringa taste buds it was spicy i m not familiar enough with traditional mexican food to know the difference between hot sauce and salsa or if there is a difference i m pretty open to spicy heat in my food but this takes it to a whole notha level think numb mouth and no ability to taste bites 2 3 4 etc the tortillas were amazing i had both corn and flour and the flan was tasty if you re a fan of flan don t know if it s fair to give a review because i feel like i need to give it another shot but for now i stand at an optimistic 3 solid stars with a possible boost in the future definitely try this place out i feel like it s a hidden gem but beware the salsa
1911,usually i just get ice cream from culvers i would not have ordered a fish sandwich but my co worker was ordering one so i decided too also very impressed with culver s north atlantic fish sandwich topped with their tartar sauce featuring olives capers and sweet relish crisp lettuce and cheddar served on a toasted hoagie roll your order is cooked when you order the item by my surprise we didn t wait hardly any time i might have to stop in and order another one
1912,this is hands down my favorite restaurant and the best food i ve ever had we ve been here once before and were dying to come back the orecchiette is a must and the artichoke special should be a constant on the menu the ambiance is great and the staff is nothing less then exceptional i recommend sitting at the chefs counter for the best experience
1913,my first trip to new orleans and my first meal here ordered the fried green tomatoes and crawfish pasta husband had the seafood gumbo and the mr b s barbecued shrimp before i even get to the food let me just say that the service here is impeccable we had 3 different people waiting on us normally this is a mess but at mr b s they all communicated with each other we got our food quickly drinks took a little bit longer but we were hungry so we didn t care and thy apologized for that as soon as you leave for the bathroom one of the waitresses comes over and folds up your napkin michelin star style the mrb s bbq d shrimp was my favorite very smoky and peppery and full of flavor hey also provide warmed bagged bread the bread pudding dessert was also great
1914,happen to stumble upon this gem we had to wait about 40 minutes but it was worth every minute my husband had the corned beef hash and i had a croissant sandwich both were delicious i m not a fan of corned beef but it was amazing the coffee was delicious as well highly recommend this place
1915,the hotel has beautiful gardens you don t need to stay in one of the rooms to see them it s free so enjoy great place to take pictures and it also has a few restaurants if you decide to eat here some of them are ok now the rooms in the hotel are not worth paying to stay in one of them it s too expansive for just a simple old room not worth it at all it has a mini fridge a small safe box but no microwave inside the room you can find one by some areas where the elevators are located
1916,ordered lamb stew noodles chinese hamburger spicy cabbage dumplings and wontons lamb noodles were good my opinion or great everyone else s opinion cabbage was really good i could tell it was cooked on very high heat dumplings were awesome had a very crispy layer of crust covering it burger was very dry
1917,for my first meal in new orleans this was absolutely awesome my tastebuds died and went to food heaven i tried the fish shrimp combo with red beans and rice creole coleslaw and for desert carmel bread pudding in a word aweosome great service from jessie mike
1918,i ve been to el charro at least 5 times although not in the past year el charro always had great food great presentation and good service their food was always great tasty and the place looked very appealing off course it was brand new when i started going there this is the el charro in oro valley i ll have to say the reason i stopped going wasn t the food but the fact that the last two times we went the restaurant was full of flies we even changed tables but the flies where pretty much everywhere i understand they have a beautiful outside sitting area and people are in and out but when you are serving food you need to take care of that i also went to another place in nm same issue and the owner wasn t too concerned about this big mistake people don t want flies flying into their plates when you sit down to eat i hope to go again but if they haven t addressed this i won t go back again with all that said other than the two times we encountered this the food is great
1919,bartender logan was super helpful they had a gluten free crust that did not make me sick i m celiac super sensitive only issue was how long it took to get our charcuterie board we got our pizza and finished it before the board came out was hoping to eat the cheese meat first but everything tasted wonderful
1920,one of my favorite places thus far traveled all the way from ct and can t wait to come back for noodles everyone was so friendly gluten free options as well as vegan
1921,this is a gorgeous and very clean hotel we had a room in the west wing at first it was a chore to get to the room but if you look for different features of the hotel they also have posted signs you will easily find your way around self parking was excellent and the walk to check in was confusing at first but you ll figure it out quickly check in was quick the walk to the room was enjoyable as the floors were shiny and clean the room was in almost immaculate shape well decorated and very very clean loved the carpet and the dark lacquered furniture and accents absolutely gorgeous bed was super comfortable and pillow just right towels were thick and soft water pressure in sink was less than satisfactory and shower pressure too bottom left hand drawer almost fell out when i opened it this may be nit picking but it was mark down because of water pressure and broken drawer another sink would have been nice yes i would stay here again
1922,stopped here for dinner on the last night of a week long work trip best meal of the week the chips are hot and crispy and perfect for salsa guacamole and queso they keep bringing out the chips till the dip bowls are empty we had tacos and they were all delicious but wait there s more do yourself a favor and get some street corn it s get outta town good the list of drafts is short but top notch the staff is super friendly and happy to make recommendations despite being super busy looking forward to my next trip to nashville to visit nectar again
1923,perfect local experience this is the kind of corner bar that everyone should wander into in every place she visits
1924,great food and the chips and salsa was sooo delicious i had to push it away ordered the skillet taco and let me tell you it was so full of flavor and meat i couldnt finish it would definitely recommend this place
1925,loved my first visit to delicia went here for sunday brunch on a date and loved the spot beautiful decor and happened to run into a few people i knew who happened to be dining at the same time so i know it was a hot spot i also had heard nothing but great things about the place so i knew we were in for a treat i ordered the skillet de la casa made with chorizo biscuits and gravy cheese and over easy eggs also came with a side of potatoes everything was delicious i almost wished it was a larger serving because i ate everything my boyfriend ordered the chorizo omelette and enjoyed that as well i was in the mood for a mojito only to find out it was the best mojito i had ever had since tao in vegas i ll definitely be back for more of those great first impression would love to come back for dinner and try more on the menu,great hotel in a nice location downtown rooms are clean and nicely decorated my only wishes are for a mini fridge and microwave as well as earlier check in times nice lobby area and good restaurants on site located near many attractions great ballroom for events i was there for a fundraising gala and enjoyed my time at the jw,great first time experience here i went here for sunday brunch recently to see what all the hype was about i definitely understand it food was delicious arrived around 12 30 to a very busy restaurant was told our wait would be about an hour luckily my boyfriend wasn t sure what to order so we spent most of the time getting suggestions and looking at pictures while enjoying some coffee beverages after an hour we were seated at the bar and placed our orders i heard great things about the grilled cheese dish and my boyfriend settled with the dutch pancake with apples we ordered a side of bacon as well once the food came out i dug in and enjoyed every bit of it the touch of honey on the grilled cheese really brought the flavor together i loved having the egg on top as well the bacon wow we couldn t even finish all the bacon but i loved it we both enjoyed our meals the items on the menu may seem strange to a first timer but trust that you will be satisfied with anything so give it a shot i would love to come back to try more i gave it 4 out of 5 only because i need to try more before giving it the title of best brunch in indy but i was definitely impressed with what i had
1926,one of the best burger joints in town i ve ordered multiple items on the menu and have yet to be disappointed their beet salad fried mac n cheese bites fried pickles and the woodstock burger are all yummy and their honey mayo sauce will rock your socks i d put that sauce on anything you could drink it with a straw not to mention they have amazing truffle and sweet potato fries only downfall is that they re pretty pricey for a burger and fries however you will leave there stuffed and you can t say that about a lot of pricey restaurants in nashville
1927,my family came here for breakfast twice the coffee was fantastic and the steel cut oats were on point my wife had the avocado toast and thought it was great as well i d highly recommend basimo to locals or tourists alike this is also a great place to watch pelicans eat breakfast on the bay
1928,i finally visited livery and it didn t disappoint the food was full of robust flavors and audrey our waitress was an exceptional guide at navigating the menu and offering her suggestions monday s are leg day where there is a special chicken leg menu option including 1 of 4 sides for only 9 it s a great value the empanadas were also very good
1929,i ve ordered delivery from here 3 times now and i ve been happy with the food overall i did get some pretty sad onion rings which was unfortunate however i really liked the cheesesteaks it wasnt greasy or soggy and delivery was fast i also got the supreme pizza and my little party inhaled it it was really good and well cooked so this might be my new spot because i ve been searching for my go to pizza delivery place so far my orders have only included the above food selections but its been consistently satisfying and eventually ill try more on the menu
1930,my first massage was a 2 hr session with daryl this last week everything about daryl and his facility was professional and clean and provided a very relaxing environment he made me feel very comfortable and worked on all the places of my body that needed it i ask for stretching which he did that was more than i could ever do myself i literally melted on the table by the time he was done i look forward to my next visit in the near future thx again for such a great experience marcus
1931,i really enjoyed our visit to sushi rose the service was amazing we sat at a table and didn t have to wait any longer than if we sat up at the sushi bar area the ahi was fresh and the flavors were amazing if it is your birthday and you show i d you get ayce free
1932,this is the busiest restaurant i have ever seen the place is packed with a line out the door every night having said that the staff does an excellent job of managing all of the chaos i have been here about 6 times to dine in and ordered take out twice i ll start with the dining in they offer call ahead seating which i highly recommend if you have small children and don t want to wait long for a table you call about 40 minutes before you arrive and although you have to wait about 10 minutes once you get there it isn t bad my boyfriend and i usually sit at the bar unless we go with others the 2 bartender regulars are very good and work well together every time we have sat at a table the service is also excellent they definitely know how to hire and train the right people it takes a certain kind of person to handle the crowd and be able to focus and perform so far every employee i ve come in contact with has been cool calm and collected and very friendly oh and did i mention the food is awesome yep have yet to have a bad meal no other steak compares their filet is out of this world don t let the parking lot fool you it is worth the wait as for the take out food was hot and just as good as eating there you can t order online but you can call
1933,the food is so good and reasonably priced the only thing is that the service is very slow
1934,i am a long time client of four paws amanda is continuing the high quality of service that i received from the prior owners i have total confidence that my cat will be well cared for when i have to travel
1935,what a beautiful hotel great atmosphere and vibe from the time you walk in the inside interior decor and design were beautiful the drinks on the roof top is a reasonable price plenty of seating area to sit back and hangout with some friends the rooftop will be a great place to hangout on a hot summer day i can t wait to do a staycation and check out them rooms
1936,such a cool atmosphere and unlike anything i ve ever been to you walk into the wine and cheese shop select a bottle or 2 and then select whatever cheeses and meats you so choose from a refrigerator once you have your items you bring it to the counter to pay they take your cheeses and meats and deliver it to your outside or upstairs inside in our case due to the rain and it s like magic it comes back a beautiful cheese board with nuts and spreads and a delicious loaf of sliced artisan bread highly recommended they also have a menu t order from the kitchen if you really need more but two of us were full after our platter and wine
1937,this was a great find thank you for the recommendation yelp it has a fabulous donut selection and the menu was very unique the wait staff were wonderful atmosphere was energetic and clean the coffee is to die for black rich bitter and flavorful
1938,i m obsessed with this place my friends and i found it by chance when we were dejectedly leaving weckerly s after finding out it isn t open on sunday mornings mornings are apparently the best time to go to cake life because they sell out of things quickly when we arrived around 10 am the shelves were overflowing with an amazing array of baked goods cakes and otherwise including some savory items after much deliberation i went with a chocolate pistachio cupcake with mascarpone frosting delicious and a caramel pecan bar even better as if that s not enough they also have pleasant surroundings and good tea and coffee
1939,great food and staff wandered in looking for good food quickly and got everything we wanted will definitely be back
1940,i m in nola for a conference i had dinner here tonight sat at the bar and got to know the local sitting next to me i had the creole stuffed fish which was excellent the sauce was delicious and made the dish fresh real mashed potatoes that weren t overwhelmed with cream and butter the vegetables were a little salty but fit well with the meal also had a hurricane m which of course you have to have when you re in new orleans service was friendly but not overwhelming definitely recommend this place only negative is it s a bit noisy and the tables are very close together
1941,this place is very cute and very clean with good coffee the staff is very nice but i ve been here three times recently and they are consistently very slow even when i am the only one in the whole shop they also have been consistently out of things and asked me if i d mind if they gave me a different drink or a different milk after i have already paid i will continue to come back for convenience but i d love to see service get a bit better
1942,our favorite mexican place for over 15 years the best queso dip in town all the mexican classics my personal favorite is the enchiladas suizas
1943,food is fresh and delicious very clean place and interior is bright one of the best places to go to the lunch my favorite part is ability to customize your stir fry or salad depending how you want them cooked never had problems with this place
1944,went for the lunch cruze and enjoyed the view from the boat the food was good buffet if you have a few hours to relax have a few drinks and a nice meal take the natchez you won t regret it
1945,they had me at the copper bunny vodka pineapple jalapeo tequila lime juice and sparkling wine in a beautiful copper bunny it packs a wallop don t try to find one to buy they mold and make them just for the restaurant starters included fresh chilled gulf oysters and crispy conch fritters with pineapple tarter sauce we then proceeded to two tuna small bites sushi grade hamachi lightly tossed with a guava curry and papaya and more traditional tuna tartare they couldn t have been better we were a little scared to try the curried goat but it was incredibly tender and the curry paired perfectly with the melt in your mouth sweet potato gnocchi no room for dessert but we can t wait to come back to nola and compre lapin
1946,nothing short of more then just amazing it s just great to experience such authentic tradition way to enjoy sushi atmosphere was zen ful and intimate i d highly recommend this place for some serious sushi 5 big stars for overall experience i can t wait to be back with sake pairings omasake samurai experience is so worthy
1947,went on a monday and stood in line for an hour service was good and the host was amazing that man should totally get a raise overall food was good but not worth the wait for that long i guess i was expecting amazing pancakes but they were just some good old fashion pancakes but i guess it s just one of those nashville traditions you have to try once
1948,excellent food don t miss it the meat is perfectly cook and the desserts are out of this world highly recommend it
1949,i ve been here twice now and am definitely a fan last night i ordered the grilled soy ginger salmon with roasted veggies and couscous the salmon was cooked perfectly and the perfect flavor the vegetables consisted of asparagus carrots and zucchini which were all crisp i was surprised to get such a great dish for under 16 service was surprisingly quick for a saturday night my table of 5 was in an out in a little over an hour
1950,visited today for lunch and it was pretty yummy the restaurant is located right by the beach so parking can be an issue but luckily we found a spot right away i had the hickory burger and my boyfriend had the grilled chicken sandwich the prices are fair it was 28 for the two of us there is a wonderful seating area which makes you feel like you re in a friends backyard there is also a great play area for kids definitely worth a visit
1951,third time eating here and i m delighted each time food is deliciously fresh and authentically prepared we enjoy vinnie the waiter who always knows how to help us order the correct amount of food and suggests the perfect level of spice we especially enjoyed the spicy beef and noodle soup service is fantastic
1952,my friends and i went through the starbucks drive thru this morning it would be a complete understatement to say this was the most well oiled caffeine fueled delicious machine 7 women 7 different drinks 7 items of food not a single mistake anyone traveling through indianapolis should stop at this beacon of eternal sunlight 10 million stars
1953,the house wine was good and the gnocchi was okay but 3 for 3 small pieces of bread with a little cheese was a bit expensive considering that you a full loaf at bonefish their affiliate
1954,this place is always delicious anything you get is going to be amazing staff has always been friendly never hesitant to make honest recommendations and they serve hot tea in one of those cool tea press things which makes me feel fancy yes the wait can be long but trust me it really is worth it to stand around all those smelly man buns and loud sorority babes
1955,service was friendly and attentive and made us feel at home food was delicious but i will say if you like heat ask for spicy i made the mistake of asking for medium and it was closer to mild i suppose that s better than going overboard and having it be too much but the flavors were fantastic very accessible menu for those who aren t fully acquainted with indian food we had a few questions and our server was very knowledgeable about the cooking process the more you learn they also have many options without being overwhelming plus they re a byo and they have a rear seating area to impress your date with i hope they re around a while south philly doesn t have many options for indian definitely going back here
1956,a very welcome authentic and delicious addition to the neighborhood this is the real thing we stopped in for the lunch special and were not disappointed my partner and i were in vientiane last year the food here is on par with what we had in laos love that they cater to vegans and vegetarians and that the food is as mild or spicy as you like we had the coconut soup and the spicy tom yum soup to start both excellent then the spring roll and the pork dumplings not so great they only offered 1 spring roll though it was very tasty and perfectly cooked but the pork dumplings were bland and flavorless however the main courses chicken with sweet basil sauce for my partner and the pad kee mao were delicious and nicely sized portions overall we really enjoyed our meal the restaurant was very clean and the staff friendly and welcoming and we were surprised that the restaurant was fairly full at lunchtime always a good sign can t wait to eat here again this will definitely be a go to spot in the neighborhood
1957,banana foster french toast and pulled pork benedict amazing quaint place in garden district all the food is great as are the juices i would highly recommend this spot as the best place to grab breakfast before a walk down magazine
1958,this small quaint place is a gem i found this restaurant on groupon the food was delicious i really enjoyed the calm atmosphere music and art on the walls the customer service was excellent the food was flavorful
1959,this place is so addicting good vegan options seitan or veggie tacos and guac good beers good service love coming here
1960,george was outstanding as our waiter top notch val and her team were very helpful with our boat fish family style sides delicious thanks so much
1961,nice place make sure that you bring 20 bills awesome games and a convenient location
1962,we really enjoyed our visit to chatham tap house our server was friendly attentive the menu is expansive the food beer were very good you must try the garlic cheese fries growlers available for purchase as well
1963,they do a great job here i got gel manicure its been over 2 weeks and if my nails had not grown i have no reason to get them done again
1964,i m so in love with this place we first came late one afternoon near closing time ben at the counter was so helpful guiding us through the menu our first time there very informative and super sweet i tried the teriyaki bowl and it was delish except the sauce was a little overpowering at the bottom we came in later in the week and decided to get the sauce on the side much better i wish they had tap water available for guest to help themselves but for now i ll be bringing my own
1965,it s not your typical thai food as far as flavor goes but it was still good roti canai delicious my favorite appetizer here samosas a little bit greasier since it has a spring roll style wrapping but still good if dipped in the roti canai fried burmese tofu weird this is coming from a vegetarian of 23 years i ve never seen tofu like that it looked more like cooked egg yolk and tasted interesting would pass on this one pad kee mao delicious but could use more sauce to cover all the noodles pad thai had a weird ketchup taste when you got to the saucier parts turned me off of it completely but my boyfriend liked it mango sticky rice amazing but small so definitely don t plan to share it delivery was on time and warm but they forgot napkins and silverware which was a bummer to be honest i probably won t order from here again there are just so many other options in the area but if i did re order i d get the roti canai and mango sticky rice for sure
1966,went for lunch today i had the rice bowl half lamb with tikka masala and half shrimp with madras nice assortment of veggies to go on top and the additional sauces were a tasty finish had to have a couple of samosas too food was good service was quick and very friendly will definitely add this place to the lunchtime rotation
1967,can t really say because i didn t dine in they seem to treat their take out customers a bit less friendly maybe that s because they know they won t be getting a tip
1968,very nice hotel the room is a good size the shower is large the staff is very friendly
1969,best smoothies in the whole world and fresh bread is amazing very knowledgeable staff
1970,we stayed at the castillo inn over thanksgiving and were pleased to get a very reasonable rate of less than 100 for the night i saw the great reviews but was even more amazed in person when i saw the room it is beautifully decorated spotless big we had the queen size and the bed was so comfy i didn t want to get out of it little touches like filtered water spout in the bathroom and soft towels were a plus my husband loved the flat screen tv too the fruit and pastries in the morning were good and the coffee was great the only strange thing was that the front desk guy wouldn t let my sign for my husband s card even after seeing him give it to me i would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat
1971,this was amazing cauliflower steaks with split peas and veggies over kale the flavor of the romesco sauce was slap yo mama good
1972,been meaning to try this place and finally did parking lot is odd and deceivingly not that big honestly we went in on a friday at about 630pm and was told it d be a 60 70 minute wait there were three hostesses not sure why we contemplated leaving but stayed anyway while waiting we noticed there were no joke at least 5 6 empty tables not being utilized tables that could have easily accommodated our table of four disappointing start we finally sat down and booths by the bar are big i liked em our waitress was great very friendly very active she was on top of orders drinks bread just very good at her job couldn t complain a bit i got the crab alfredo pasta and it was good wasn t mind blowing but i would eat it again for sure i tasted the wings they were doused with sauce some like that some don t they were good as well crab cake was surprisingly good too overall would go back but maybe during a slower period
1973,let s see where to start to begin with there was a line outside today was a cold breezy yet sunny day so it was somewhat bearable to wait outside there was a 25 30 min wait which i endured because my friend wanted to really try it honestly i get real leary when i see lines outside of certain restaurants especially in houston and new orleans because i have learned that it s not always about the hype with so many eateries in places like new orleans and houston it s hard for me to actually wait in a long line there have been times that i have seen the long lines for restaurants and the food was subpar this was one of those occasions for starters the host was welcoming and the other waitresses seemed friendly but not ours let s call her marie marie seemed like the classic example of trying to help a meth head out and give them a job she was unattentive rude and lack of understanding first we asked what were the choices for the entree two sides options on the menu and she started listing the sides i asked her if there was a menu to read what the sides are and she said that was the list ok before we could ask anything else she drifted off somewhere else and we had to bring her back basically you re kinda forced to get the buffet option because if she get the entree you re limited to what you can get even though other food choices are available on the buffet bright side if you go with the buffet you will get a chance to sample some of their popular items moving on we got our tea which was phenomenal i d say crack tea because it was hard to just not keep drinking it aside from that i got the fried chicken green beans gumbo and stuffed bell peppers you also get the choice of an omelette or french toast tried the french toast as well once we got our drinks and started eating ol marie went missing for awhile we needed refills napkins and clearing our table of empty plates but she was nowhere to be found other waiters had to step in to clear our table we were getting ready to leave but wanted more tea so we asked if we could get a refill and she just walked off without acknowledging if she heard us or not we also wanted to know if we could get it to go then all of a sudden she reapppeared pouring tea which she sloppily wasted on the table and my purse no words or apology i told her we were trying to inform her that we wanted them to go and the bill split but yet again she walked off without acknowledging if she heard everything she returned with plastic cups the cups were dusty to the point you could wipe your finger over and see the residue no thank you marie also brought back the bill without it being split as we asked when we reminded her of our request she rudely replied we dont split checks but you could simply divide it boyyy it took everything in me not to go off i told her we re fully aware of how to do math however we asked for separate bills in which you never told us that it was a policy to not separate the tab at this point the owner nearby could see our frustration and his as well in which he told her all you have to is seperate it out no big deal this was too confusing for ms marie in which the owner had to further explain eventually she just took three seperate payments smh overall the food and experience was ok i had to add some salt and pepper to some of my food which is a red flag considering it seems to be a well known nola spot honestly the fried chicken from willie s was waaaay better can t say i d return but i can cross this off my list
1974,what a cool concept i m a cat lover and so are my kids i sometimes take them to shelters or cats sanctuary cause they love meeting new cats but these places usually aren t too welcoming of those not here to adopt the cat therapy on the other hand is filling this need you pay a small entrance fee 12 20 with yelp check in and you get to hang out with up to 25 cats you can adopt if you want or just spend a moment with cool cats i love the idea that they save cats from euthanasia while socializing them also a great way to see their personalities before deciding to adopt check them out
1975,one of my favorite stores to shop for crystals at i make sure to stop by here every time i m in new orleans they have a huge selection of crystals geodes and beads and everything is pretty reasonably priced i m not super knowledgeable on crystals yet just diving in but everything is laid out with names and descriptions so i can find what kind of properties i m looking for i m still just picking pretty stones at this point but i do feel more energy from the stones i ve gotten here and picked out in person as opposed to some of the crystals i ve received online it s awesome they have an online store and i ve really enjoyed the newsletter they send out you re in new orleans a super spiritual city definitely check this shop out
1976,solid food but weird service and high prices probably won t go back
1977,great donuts with original flavors get there early they sell out
1978,this lil place was so delicious great service friendly chef too all of the selections were served hot harty portions the entrees were great se lecttions the menu had so many choices see pics,the evening started out great 10 min into being seated after ordering and served cocktails the eletricity went off for the entire time till we left drinks were on the house since we tolerated the uncomfortable situation as we had guedt from out of town with us,the service by waitress jenea was excellent she was well versedof all menu items happy to explain the typds of oyster dishes the crab cakes were excellent fried picles w creole ranch dressing was great the gumbo red beans jambalaya were delicious the desserts bread pudding and slu e of key lime pie were just awesome the omly drawback was tge luke warm coffee was a disappointment overall a great experience i will be back

1981,this joint is legit phenomenal service our waitress was andrea she was great everything she did was spot on she helped us with our order and asked many of questions to make sure we got exactly what we wanted the cinnamon rolls pancake was 10 10 credits to the chef it was the best cinnamon flavored dish i have ever had it was better than any actual cinnamon roll i ve ever had respect goes out to this place

1984,this trendy place offers a rustic and relaxing vibe perfect for a saturday morning coffee spot i had the poached eggs with avocado bacon and cheese on fresh sourdough toast she had the avocado chili lime toast on wheat which was also very delicious the food was for sure 5 star quality in regards to the presentation freshness and taste but giving buddy brew an overall 4 rating due to the price and limited parking
1985,great espresso and amazing tea selection perfect for both coffee and tea lovers espresso was bold yet smooth with delicious chocolate notes they carried white2tea as well as a few others the tea list was very extensive with a fantastic selection of everything from herbal to puerh
1986,fantastic spot for just about anything at this sports bar it is my favorite spot in brandon and going to start frequenting it they have the best bbq chicken salad anyone could ask for highly recommend it also their grilled wings are from a different world you won t find anything better i look forward to come back and trying every different rub great atmosphere and will start going there for sunday football when that s back
1987,4 5 5 this is a great local establishment somewhat removed from the hubbub of the french quarter the interior feels charming and lived in and there s a good amount of sidewalk seating as well i had their breakfast in a cup concoction one morning and their portobella red pepper panini on another occasion both were very tasty i also appreciate how this is a place where locals and tourists converge as the atmosphere is welcoming to both
1988,we stopped in for drinks and apps my friend wanted a frozen drink and we were told they didn t have a blender there was one i saw on the way out but it must have been broken we ordered the tachos and they were delicious and a generous portion the service was fine we didn t stay long to really gauge much of that and it was pretty empty the deck was beautiful and had a great view

1990,love this spot my sister and i come here regularly and always enjoy a delicious meal byob is a nice touch and they re always ready with glasses for your beverage
1991,after the wild mushroom gnocchi i really wanted to give it a five star rating but i had ordered a beet and goat cheese salad light on the dressing well it was so light that it ended up being non existent nice ambiance excellent service and great location i ll be back
1992,had the most delicious meal here last night we reserved a room and it was so fun we ordered sushi hibachi and pad thai every single thing we ate was delicious the jalapeo yellowtale was my personal favorite and the filet mignon hibachi was to die for
1993,a nice experience pricey but good service they got me in after a 2 minute wait it was pretty busy but i didn t feel horribly cramped they were playing 80s music and the girls really seemed to like working there the store has a bright clean looking vibe which goes well with the fashion mall i got the deluxe or upgraded pedicure which was about 45 dollars i m a guy who doesn t get pedicures often but it was my bday and i decided to splurge nice massage chairs give you a great pat down while they take care of your feet i don t like big crowds or small crowded places so i was relieved i didn t have to deal with either the girls were all very sweet and i would definitely not mind returning but 45 is pretty steep for just a pedicure i will need to try the regular one to see if the upgrade was worth it
1994,we built a new home in fall 2016 and mcmullin helped us design several rooms as well as choose lighting and paint colors for nearly the entire home i was so overwhelmed with the task at hand but kristen worked so thoughtfully and patiently with me she put so much thought into choosing items within our budget and i truly couldn t have done it without her she allowed for my opinion to be heard but guided me when i was struggling with making decisions i can t say enough about the job they did all of the ladies we worked with were awesome from the front desk to assistants every window treatment there were many was correctly measured and over 18 months later everything has held up well even with 3 kids running around i would not hesitate to use them again making your house a home is a worthy investment and should be treated with this level of care
1995,the spa is one of a kind obviously on the pricey side but it was very worth it i have never been so relaxed in my life and the customer service was amazing wish they would have accommodated more for my husbands birthday as i told them ahead of time but i would return with out a doubt also the doors are very thin we heard our neighbors slam there door every time they entered and left the rooms are pretty outdated but very clean the restaurants are very pricey i think more expensive than vegas went to the caf down stairs for breakfast and the same items i would have got at starbucks for about 15 was 35 but i don t gamble so all and all it was worth a nice birthday weekend for my hubby
1996,i think one of the best things to do in nashville is to visit nashville symphony if you get a chance go see a jazz concert a classical concert whatever you choose you will not be disappointed
1997,this place is fantastic the gluten friendly because cross contamination pancake is amazing i usually get the turkey sausage rustic vegetables and potatoes yum i first went here when i lived in la then they put two in clearwater i always bring friends from out of town here mostly because there s always something for everybody i wish they had dairy free creamer for the coffee but i ll still come and bring my own
1998,the best i ve ever had the chicken sauces sides were all delicious the salad had a tasty cilantro dressing on it and the spicy red beans were on point
1999,i can t say enough about this place the food is great the restaurant is clean and trendy and the employees are fun and engaging today i went in to order some tacos and while i was waiting one of the guys behind the counter offered me a free smoothie they had made some in the back and had extra it was so thoughtful of him quite honestly i would not normally think to order a smoothie there as i just go for the tacos but now that i had a chance to taste how good they are i will definitely order one in the future excellent customer service

2008,the place is really nice and the staff was very friendly the doctor took the time to talk with my son i waited 3 hours to see the doctor which was frustrating it seems the wait is a little ridiculous for an urgent care with only 4 people in front of us overall it was a good experience just wish it was faster
2009,i moved in this area around october of last year and i had not stopped at this location of angelos pizza until today i will definitely be returning as i ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and i saw their pizza that looked really scrumptious this is run by real italians and i will be back the food was magnifico

2013,a great spot on bourbon st and much more relaxed calm and collected than the many bars here feels like a cozy courtyard with quaint metal works furniture the ambiance is great a jazz band playing bar service and you are simply chilling on a beautiful nite this may be the best place to be it s a good spot to rest your tired feed and grab a snack a beer or a cup of coffee while enjoying the jazz band

2015,happy international burger day we have been coming here for a couple years and haven t been disappointed hubby always has the spicy crunch combo and i had the double mushroom double cheese combo one with curly fries the other with regular fries each came with ketchup and a herb aioli as well as a fountain pop i have also tried the blue cheese burger and their signature bj burger which are equally delicious fresh quality ingredients are used we would give it a 5 but we thought the tables and benches could be updated you have the option of customizing your burgers as a mini clip board and marker are at each table with a list of ingredients unfortunately diners have scribbled on the tables and benches perhaps a sheet of glass or plexiglass on the tables would make it easier to clean
2016,excellent cioppino great service friendly staff well located at start of stearns wharf
2017,loved this place our server kat made the night even more special from her sincere smile to her knowledgeable recommendations our time there was a stop we d repeat in a heartbeat our group upon kat s recommendation ordered the fresh lime margaritas and they were not stingy with the tequila the queso gets high marks too it was creamy with just a bit of spice i followed mine with the shrimp tacos that did not fail to please the atmosphere is hip though i m not didn t matter kat made us feel welcome
2018,for what a room costs especially an atrium view room i expect the cleaning to be better the closet for hanging clothes safe ironing board etc has not been cleaned in a very long time the shower drain was clogged so it took about 5 minutes after we were done showering that the water would be gone

2032,the way i found this place is through my brother at first i was a little skeptical about it because everytime we turned around something was wrong with my brother s 2003 chevrolet equinox for a while i thought it was this place because my brother would always come back and forth here one thing was wrong with the car then it was two things and so forth the first time i entered this place was when i needed a tire since i had blew the tire on my 2015 mitsubishi outlander sport we came here instead of going to the dealer since the dealer was too far where i had blew the tire and this place was nearby it was on a saturday and we spoke to miguel miguel was very professional and asked what was wrong and could he help us also he explained the place closed at 12 noon on saturday and we had to bring it in as soon as possible i ended up calling roadway assistance and they put on the donut after an hour waiting and then we rode on to rapco we made an appointment for monday since it was too late on saturday it was after noon and on monday they fixed the tire i bought a new tire from them and they mounted it and i was out in a flash i have since been going there quite frequently with my other car 2014 mitsubishi outlander it is the same story i am quite pleased with this repair place steve miguel and joey are simply the best they listen patiently because i ask a lot of questions and they are always so polite

2034,this place is the bomb lanna who gave me my pedicure was wonderful her foot massage included hot stone and reflexology i was on a mini vacation with my daughter so yes i did spurge and got the full all out pedicure but sooo worth it i chose here because of other yelp reviews all are right in loving here the only reason i m giving jan spa and nail only 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had a long wait so beware when visiting i believe the long wait was because the are so good in the area that they are that busy
2035,what an excellent addition to the neighborhood we started out with the caprese the fresh mozzarella made in house was perfect then we had our focaccia included for pasta dishes which was chewy and excellently flavored the pasta was incredible just perfect can t wait to try the different sauce options the one personal preference i would ve changed was the music selection i would go for something a little more mellow for the vibe of the restaurant but otherwise perfect restaurant experience
2036,simply the best most authentic italian style pizza in tucson this pizza tastes the same as how pizza tastes in good restaurants and pizzerie in italy yummm x 1 000 000 scott rules
2037,hot chicken tacos and pork tacos were excellent hot cauliflower and chicken and waffles as well brussels sprouts with pork belly very good but a bit over glazed for my taste tuna tostada was nice but i think the tuna may have sat in the fridge great service good bloody maries easy parking would go back
2038,this was my first visit their food and service exceeded my expectations i ordered a greek salad with a chicken skewer and it was a generous serving and so fresh i didn t realize it at the time but the owner was the cashier at our visit if you are a member of the l a fitness in the same complex you also receive a 10 off discount which is what i received you can order online at their website for take out or call in your order for take out too if you prefer i opted to dine in even though we planned to take out really fresh really happy really pleased i will be back

2044,i love keke s this place is delicious i actually didn t have breakfast and decided to try lunch the buffalo chicken wrap was amazing service was also excellent
2045,with the hype of the c house and the first impression when walking in i thought there was no way i d be disappointed i m not sure if it was the late dining or the lack of ordering experience but we were not impressed when asking the bartender which appetizer we should get he recommended the poutine s don t get me wrong they were good but he should ve mentioned that fries came with the very dry disappointing chicken and biscuit sliders we ordered so we didn t end up with two orders of the same thing there was nothing about the sliders that we enjoyed the biscuits and the chicken were both bone dry the service atmosphere cobb salad and cheesy mac were good but definitely expected more for the hype and price willing to try another time and hopefully will get a better experience

2055,made a detour into garagiste meadery for a drink on saturday evening sampled four of the different styles they had on tap reboog noir 95 cab ride sofla fruit punch and hondo quality i have very limited experience with mead other than knowing it is made with honey and it is somewhere between beer and wine it has never really been something i have sought out i have tried a few and was left generally unimpressed well garagiste meadery has made believers out of both my girlfriend and myself after hearing about the mystical reboog at three different places in tampa we knew that was where to start this is their pb j mead and we got the reboog noir this addition made with a blackberry touch it was incredible a liquid sandwich all the right notes and no sense that you are actually consuming a drink with 14 abv i was also a big fan of hondo a meadowfoam mead with coffee sweet but not too sweet with hints of coffee and a wonderful aftertaste as for sofla fruit punch it was more in line with my expectations this mix of mango passionfruit guava guanoabana and plantains was just far too sweet for me 95 cab ride which was based on a cabernet was like a bad strong wine but did i mention the reboogs you should get it and then get it again quantity the sample pour i got was 3oz while a full pour was 6oz perfect to provide a taste of the offerings and then let you dive into your favorite which honestly will probably be a reboog value sample sizes were 7 while a full pour fell between 11 and 13 as this was my first trip to a meadery it is impossible to gauge the deal but i was happy paying these prices for their creations ambiance garagiste meadery is located in tampa heights a quickly developing area in tampa in an area full of hip breweries restaurants and coffee shops it fits perfectly into the scene the meadery has a small outdoor area which mades up part of this creepy thoroughfare between them and a nearby brewery inside the space is very open and bright honestly a little too bright with those fluorescent lights you typically find in hospitals they have a bar on one side equipment along the back wall and then a bunch of tables lining the rest of the space they have two televisions one over the bar and one in the back corner and a shelf full of games for guests hanging out a while hip hop music played in the background but it seemed like they were going to shift audio over to the television as we left crowd it was us and one other couple who also wandered over from hidden springs mead hasn t caught on in the same way as craft beer but i would not be surprised if that changed quickly with the work they are doing here and with the success of their reboog series i expect this place to be all the rage service got to spend some time chatting with the owner and hear about how the place came about he was extremely friendly and happy to talk to us about mead the area and other great spots in tampa as one of the newer kids on the block he is doing a great job at getting their name out parking coming from hidden springs ale works we just walked through the alleyway that separates the two businesses they don t have a designated parking lot but street parking is available in the area extra garagiste meadery is pretty awesome while i am still not completely sold on mead as a regular beverage i now know they can make it pretty darn good i will be dreaming about reboog until i can have it again and that makes this a place anyone mead lover or not will enjoy
2056,went in on a saturday night with my girlfriend for some dinner was greeted by the host who rather rude for a first impression he asked if we had reservations which we did not and told us it would be a long wait before we told him we d sit outside since there wasn t a wait there after sitting outside for about 5 7 minutes with no server we went inside to find a seat at the bar we started off with some craft cocktails which were very good then placed our food order the food came out at different times which was odd to me first the pizza then side of veggies then salad then meatballs all we re very good especially the margarita pizza with fresh basil and the meatballs we tried all 4 types of balls eggplant and beef were my favorite the salad was unorthodox in my opinion 5 individual large romaine leaves they were out of pasta fagioli which i was really excited to try we switched to wine after our cocktails and finished our meal with some cannolis overall was great food i was impressed with the food and drinks there is definitely room for improvement with service but being a new place id expect that i ll definitely be back to try some other stuff on the menu
2057,really great atmosphere it reminded me of a diner the service was great and the food came out fast the cheese curds are amazing the double cheeseburger meal is well priced and you ll leave full looking forward to coming back and trying the frozen custard
2058,i love this place a very cozy and fun neighborhood bar the best bartenders and awesome quizzo on wednesdays plus they have rock n roll bing on thursday nights always a good time in a friendly atmosphere
2059,omgoodness we literally stumbled into this place because of its proximity to the marriott on canal it s was close and we didn t want to be our far in the rain what a great find this was the food the service the drinks were excellent i later found out it s new to the french quarter they have found their niche go
2060,went there for the first time tonight for dinner at around 5 we live very close but never went they were not busy got seated right away and the service and food was great bogo on frajias that were delicious very reasonable prices will go again
2061,this is my favorite bakery in chinatown i usually get a pineapple bao bun red bean bao and pork bun these buns are the cheapest and they also have bags of multiple buns with and without filling they have boba but i ve never tried it as well as custard tarts i love the buns and that s what i go here for the service is decent they don t speak much english which isn t out of the ordinary in chinatown there s lots of seating and it s decently clean come here for the cheapest priced buns and baked goods which are yummy in chinatown
2062,went there a few years ago for the first time visited last week still a good as ever
2063,hotel was basic nothing fancy but the workers there were very friendly and had great customer service my wife and i asked them of things to do and places to go and avoid they broke down everything we needed to know about staying in the french quarter and made our stay great the hotel is located in such a perfect walking distance from bourbon and is surrounded by places to eat and drink i really recommend checking out oceana grill down the street
2064,we ate here several times mainly because of the excellent shrimp ju ju appetizer in fact our second night we had 2 orders of the shrimp we are grateful to our server colin for recommending them our first night as i m writing this review i can still picture the shrimp and even better i can still taste it there are a few dishes i dream about and this is one of them we also tried the fried calamari it was good i m from the north where we like marinara sauce with calamari in the south it seems to be served with sweeter soy or sweet chili based sauces which i m still getting used to our entrees were very good po boy and fish of the day it s a nice place ambiance wise in a very good location i will give a shout out to colin for recommending the shrimp ju ju
2065,amazing experience amazing location amazing eats drinks this was our first experience and we were close to first in line since we were so excited first of all the botanical gardens is one of my favorite places to visit even when the place is packed there are so many secluded benches and spots to feel relaxed and refreshed we are fans of shopping and eating local so it was special supporting this event we enjoyed delicious morsels ranging from italian mexican peruvian bbq and salads we were particularly fond of dominick s lasagne and cannolis and the portions were quite generous we will visit soon el cisne and seis kitchen were our favs for mexican fare yellow brick coffee cold brew was tops all the bbq places were delicious we will soon be visiting brother john s mama s hawaiian bbq served some amazing lemon bars yum speaking of yum the nothing bundt cakes were outstanding we had so much fun visiting with others while we waited in line friendliness was all around we will plan to attend next year as this is a wonderful event
2066,this place is so well thought out they have a clean laid back atmosphere with welcoming people and fresh delicious food i thoroughly enjoyed my meal here my only complaint is that i don t live closer i would be an everyday regular
2067,after our recent trip to new orleans i came back to reno appreciating this place even more than before the shrimp po boy is my favorite thing on the menu and their corn bread is amazing as well
2068,the new patio is a great addition the breakfast is fantastic logan was a great host and offered great service
2069,i got the avocado toast and my friends got acai bowls the avocado toast was just okay the avocado did not seem fresh and it was just on regular wheat toast i could have done something better myself for cheaper though i myself did not try the bowls there was very little smoothie at the bottom for the 8 oz and they were very liquidy i would opt for the 16 oz even though 10 99 for an acai bowl is pretty steep ultimately it wasn t bad but i probably would not come here again
2070,i cannot say enough good things about the store manager garrett i had some trouble with a return which i tried to resolve over the phone with corporate customer service they were no help so i went into the store instead garrett went above and beyond and made sure that the problem was solved to my satisfaction i was very pleased and impressed with the customer service i received in the store
2071,i don t normally shop at whole foods because their prices are so out of line with other grocers in town however i am having such a time getting rid of a colony of ants in my apartment making it impossible to cook there that i needed some prepared food and they have a bar where you can pick what you need and pay for it by the pound i also frequent the olive bar where they offer many different types of olives mix and match today i remembered to pick up the instructions about how to use the amazon prime discount on sale items in the store i ll be setting up my phone so that i can do that
2072,delicia was great their cocktails are handcrafted and delicious try the fire ice they made vegetarian accommodations for me and it was wonderful i definitely recommend this spot for a perfect date night or night out with friends it s a nicer place with a down to earth feel i ll be back
2073,i found this place through my partner as he was getting some work done on his car when i told them about my honda they were very excited about it i didn t even mention yet that i needed some work done on it but they seemed so passionate i just got some brake light bulbs fixed and some rear brake work in since i asked them to check to see if anything needed replacing they are super nice very honest knowledgeable have great rates for repairs and most of all they never made me feel like i was a car challenged person also there is a cat in the waiting room that s super cute d if you live in nola or are in the greater nola area let this shop be your go to they pretty much do everything
2074,nice easy breakfast with good sized portions delicious iced tea the order first then sit and wait style makes it easy going and the wait for the home cooked food wasn t long despite their featured hash name the potatoes are roasted and not hashed still tasted good but was hoping it was hashed
2075,awesome food awesome beer awesome service i had the meatball sandwich and slaw both awesome my favorite beer was the prescott achocholypse
2076,i was looking for a place in cool springs and decided to give them a try i was treating my daughter so we got the basic mani pedi i was impressed by the cleanliness and professionalism since i am in healthcare i wash my hands all the time the technician talked to me about the gel manicure but it was not a hard sell which i appreciated so far my fingernails haven t chipped but that always has more to do with myself than the manicure the pedicure was relaxing and looks great we will be back even if we make the trip only for this salon update the attached picture six days after my manicure i have moved furniture packed boxes washed my hands 1 million times and did my normal daily activities and my manicure still looks great
2077,fabulous atmosphere with amazing drinks and great food i was there for a baby shower and the easily handled our little crowd everyone raves about their food and drinks nothing was a disappointment service was fabulous our waiter was helpful with recommendations and quick to serve overall this was a great experience
2078,i am a loyal dutch bros customer since i lived out of state this location did not disappoint their service is amazing fast and always very friendly i always ask what they recommend and i have yet to be disappointed my go to drink when i need a pick me up is the double torture i love going to dutch its like starbucks who
2079,great coffee first time at la colombe and got the draft latte never had a better latte before in my life they also provide a counter with cream sugar syrup etc it s convenient they have a bathroom and people come to either chat or work on their laptops would love to stop by again
2080,recommended by my wedding venue they did an absolutely amazing job on our cake the cake was moist and the buttercream frosting was delicious considering that i was really not sure exactly what i wanted and only had an idea my cake was exactly what i wanted simple and meaningful thank you for making my wedding cake so meaningful
2081,we had their pizza for a long time at the rillito farmer s market and finally they have a brick and table place this is hands down one of the best pizzas i have had and among the top 3 florence included it is thin crust so it you are looking for chicago style you will be disappointed their caprese pizza with pine nuts is amazing they have won international competitions and it shows
2082,the burgers were excellent as were the fries we had a three year old with us and they brought her food right away our server bryce was excellent very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive would recommend highly
2083,loved it me and a group of my coworker went for lunch and came back ready to sleep definitely going back
2084,this hotel is fabulous i stayed with a friend n will be going back in 2 weeks rooms are immaculate i ve stayed at alot or hotels in reno n this by far is amazing
2085,a great restaurant to take people visiting from out of town very popular for breakfast brunch on the weekends should expect to wait at least an hour any time after 9 30 am and service takes a little while but great menu options and delicious food also a great bakery coffee and gelato counter that offers instant service or items to enjoy while waiting to get called
2086,everyone treated me great the care given was fine and i have no complaints about any individual or my care however i may choose an alternative next emergency they were playing fox news loud and clear in the waiting room the equivalent of sensationalized propaganda tv i felt i d wandered into a nazi camp i got up and moved away with my back to the tv but still had to listen yes i m gay and liberal but i do not expect to have to be bombarded with any liberal conservative or religious extremely divisive tv in a medical arena play the 80 s music louder for god s sake sheesh no thinking person does this by accident so it must mean ochsner urgent care prefers it fox news am i in arkansas i really thought every individual was great
2087,overall was excellent other than the price the atmosphere is very nice more of a fine dining experience i would rather pay 10 12 and get caribbean food elsewhere i understand the location is in hyde park so likely the rent is pricey so food has to be pricey but it would be wise to get a place else where and lower prices jerk chicken was so good spicy and the way it should be
2088,food was really good i got a bacon blue cheese burger it was a fantastic burger perfectly cooked the blue cheese was awesome the beer wasn t the coldest but it was good that s why the 4 stars would definitely go back
2089,great service and amazing service would definitely go back the person doing my nails took extra time to help pick out my color and gel manicure was amazing
2090,even though i def gained some extra love on my belly because i visited biscuit love 6 days in a row it still holds a special place in my belly i mean my heart starting with the service which is key yes the lines are long on the weekends but it moves fast and it s an organized process the staff are all so friendly and big kudos to them for remembering us and then gifting us the bonuts to try the bonuts are amazing i ordered the standard egg plate which doesn t disappoint because you get a little bit of everything my favorite part is that if you are vegetarian like us they will substitute the meat for yummy potatoes or mushrooms the jam is the shiiiiit so delicious my favorite way of enjoying the egg plate is slicing the biscuit in half dressing it up with jam loading it with scrambled eggs and then topping it off with grits it s heaven the grits are pretty damn good also the iced lattes with the homemade vanilla syrup is magic even if you just go once biscuit love is a must visit on your next nashville trip
2091,look no further hands down this is the best casino i ve ever stayed at stayed at the tuscany tower and what a beautiful view huge bathroom double shower king size beds and lets talk about watching tv while taking a bath great selection of restaurants definitely worth your visit you won t be disappointed thanks peppermill
2092,place is nice but a little pricey service a little slow too but the food was pretty good l
2093,selfishly i don t want to write about how wonderful the pacific crest hotel was selfishly i m afraid that the rest of the world will experience a stay at the pacific crest hotel thus making it harder for me to stay on my next trip to santa barbara this place is not only one block from the beach and you can see the ocean from the hotel but also close to state street and everything else you hope to visit in santa barbara the rooms felt homey clean and made us feel like we were staying in someone s home though it is a hotel it didn t feel like it the owners jennifer and greg are always on property great to talk with and have suggestions about sb jennifer provides a homemade breakfast each morning oatmeal omelette bars coffee cakes fruits and other morning treats were provided each morning loved our visit and can t wait to come back and stay at the pacific crest
2094,this place is great the service is consistently amazing i have been going here for years and it keeps getting better the food is great and the pricing is reasonable
2095,love this restaurant great food gyros are awesome salads are great owner is always working and greets you with a smile menu is varied and everything we have tried is really good they have great coupons and they have generous servings i always feel we are getting a great deal one of our local favorites
2096,this little restaurant is a part of the new armature works on an extremely busy st patrick s day weekend they were very attentive bartender cayden was working the room like a pro he was very friendly asking guests if they were feeling festive and happily offered them a green beer the owner felicia in the chaos was also attentive and friendly the authentic cuban food was fresh delicious and very reasonably priced we had the wonderful hemingway cuba and la frita cubana both were delicious the yucca fries and dipping was outstanding to top it off we had a refreshing sangaria
2097,i was visiting from out of town and as a fitness fanatic it s tough to miss a workout the gym is easily accessible and has 1 parking first timers pay a cheaper rate of 10 for the first class each day has different theme and style of workout i took the total body thursday class with riki and i couldn t be gladder that i did she s super knowledgeable and encouraging and even friendlier the class is set up such that you will receive plenty of personalized attention and motivation classes are scalable and easily tailored such that people of all fitness backgrounds and capabilities can participate and have fun i was immediately welcomed with open arms into the getfit 615 community the gym is welcoming to all people of all backgrounds and interests i liked that they use the gym s brand to advance social welfare such as the clothing drive they were putting on at the gym they also sell water kombucha snacks and apparel at reasonable prices i emailed them inquiring about coming to a class before i arrived in nashville and riki promptly responded after class we stayed to ask for recommendations for local food and activities we received recommendations on everything from coffee to places to go hiking to bars every place recommended to us that we tried was great in staying behind after the class to give us recommendations they went above and beyond what was expected and exemplified why getfit 615 is so much more than another gym
2098,great food and staff as this is a new place to the area the staff takes time and explains menu options i like having this option in the area for lunch,happened by this place several times and never went in decided to try it this morning for a quick bite to eat i was welcomed by an employee z he provided service with a smile and was informative he recommended a great smoothie and an awesome wrap both of which were very satisfying and reasonably priced i will be going back as soon as possible,the service is above excellent at ralph s from the moment you walk in everyone wants to make sure you are comfortable and satisfied this is team service at its best it s almost hard to discern who you actual sever is everyone works together and the results are customers that are happy and never without anything add to this service that the food is prepared fresh and to order i love the small family style feel i will patronize this establishment anytime over the large chain restaurants with frozen food and horrible service
2099,we ve stayed in nashville downtown about 6 times so far and the omni or hyatt are typically our hotel of choice we booked the fairlane on a 3rd party site as it was new and i was intrigued by the laid back yet modern design this is now my favorite hotel every need is tended to by friendly and caring employees this weekend was my 40th birthday and the staff far exceeded my expectations diego was our concierge or valet but he also took care of our luggage and brought us ice i can t think of the name of the gentlemen at the front check in but he was he kindest person also the coffee barista even wished me a happy birthday today upon check out and i hadn t ventured there all weekend for price location quality of stay and staff the fairlane has mastered boutique stays with amazing staff the bed was comfortable also
2100,these guys simply rock they are always helpful and fun i have now bought four bikes from them and will keep going back for maintenance
2101,this is a great little place cozy but well lit great menu the food was fast out to the table and delicious the chipped beef on toast was really good and the pancakes were almost perfect the coffee was decent and exactly as it should be for this kind of place the staff was friendly and accommodating we visited on super bowl sunday and they broke out into the eagles fight song so that was fun we are definitely going back and i will definitely recommend it to my friends two little details that i really liked they had cholula as well as tobasco on the table and offered sugar in the raw i d love to see biscuits and gravy on the menu or as a special but that is not a game changer at all
2102,highly recommend their food is always fresh and served with a smile they always have a variety of salads as well completely authentic nothing like homemade dominican breakfast on a sunday morning
2103,came for brunch at this place i was not disappointed the food here is an amazing korean fusion so be prepared for that the restaurant itself is nestled on a street corner and has about 15 tables on the inside they do take reservations so be sure to put one in if you want to get a table the waiter was very nice and since it was a jordan fusion restaurant he was able to explain and walk us through the menu for my meal i went the asian burger the burger was great and it came with a spicey ketchup which was really good my friends got the bibimbop which i was so jealous that i did not get if you come here you must get the bibimbop the food was cooked perfectly and the beef was juicy and spicey oh also be sure to get a few pitchers of sangria with your meal the sangria was great and fruity
2104,idk where to begin with mazzaros they are like one of the best things st pete has to offer when we were renovating our kitchen we literally ate here every day and never got tired of it absolutely everything from the butcher cheese and wine room coffee bar bakery deli fresh pasta and bread and ready made foods are superb they have amazing imported specialty items that are hard to find else where also i would like to add that although this place gets crazy busy all the time it runs like a well oiled machine and all the employees are very friendly and greet you with a smile
2105,nice clean store with great selection of organics people at the register are always friendly too and love that their bakery super careful about cross contamination when it comes to peanuts at least so they say when i expressed the concern,i went back here to try the dishes again after the owner responded to my review about it being too bland the first time i was there when they just opened he said they made some adjustments to the recipes and they certainly did and they added a stone bowl upgrade 3 dollars was a bit much to pay for the upgrade but bimbimbop is not the same without it so i had to have it it was outstanding the flavor was just right i did not even have to add any red sauce it was so good my 6 year old keeps asking to go back we also ordered the chicken wings which were superb this time and the potstickers were great as well all around we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will be back it would be great for them to expand the menu to include a few more choices like maybe the seafood soft tofu bowl mmm
2106,real gem coming across this place wraps were delicious it was a cool unexpected find
2107,one of the best ramen we ve had we travel extensively throughout the states and this place is truly authentic they even speak japanese
2108,april beautiful day outside chill restaurant i had smoked salmon and avocado on toast forgot how good fresh avocado tastes best service from amari on porch trip advisor wrong 1 best place to eat at st pete s beach on corey ave
2109,excellent food and very accommodating this is a primarily gluten free and solely vegan restaurant in montecito the service is great and food is delicious highly recommended
2110,wow french toast was delicious but if you like chocolate and you want something amazing from first to last bite order the chocolate sin
2111,great selection of vegetarian and meat wraps tacos house favs like bibimbap spicy fried rice kimchee dumplings salads they even serve spam reasonable price accepts all payment crowded line is forming as i write this review vein from hawaii i highly recommend this eatery you will not be disappointed
2112,ft worth ribeye was perfect can t ask for a better meal and service for under 20 worth the drive from downtown st pete roasted nuts are addicting hide them until they deliver your food sat at the bar and was well attended even though i just had coffee and water from door to seat everyone goes out of the way to make your visit special
2113,so this location is small can get jammed packed at times around prom wedding season when this happens you need to understand that patience is recommended the past month has brought me to this location three times each time it was busier than the last my son needed a suit for a job interview at a hospital within a week this is a tall order with the alterations that had to be made the suit was ready on sunday as promised for monday s interview i then received a flash sale notification for a sale that i couldn t resist it was difficult sorting through the inventory that was left online but shannon helped me navigate through the process if you wanna clean your act up and look the part ask for will he can make even you look presentable
2114,we were looking to pass the time while waiting to do something in town and stumbled upon this place i got a petit four and my boyfriend got a strawberry swirl cheese cake they were small but satisfying as i don t need a ton of sweets to satisfy my sweet tooth however they do have larger cakes and cupcakes for those that like a little more the cappuccino was delicious and i loved the little cafe environment the music they played was relaxing but hip we will definitely be back probably before our trip is over
2115,i was craving for ramen when i found this gem but it wasn t the ramen that i m rating here it falls a bit short comparing to the ramens i ve had in ny that steven roll that was one of the best rolls that i ve had good thing i was pretty hungry and asked for roll recommendations i was definitely not disappointed i would love to come back once i visit philly again
2116,exactly what you want in a philly diner crusty exterior stern attitude and great food get close and comfortable with the other patrons the staff is in your face this is philly the goods go birds
2117,called in an order for a large group with a variety of requests was not dissappointed everything was correct the price is great and the food is fantastic crab benedict caught my eye initially served on a croissant with cajun hollindaise sauce it was everything i hoped and dreamed crab cake with real crab and minimal breading like it should be egg was perfectly poached with a great texture and runny yolk sauce was perfect 2 eggs on 2 halves of the croissant picked it up like a sandwich chose grits for my side and was not disappointed though i did look longingly at the fruit side which was cut up banana and strawberry not the normal melon crap everybody really enjoyed their food even the chick who got a veggie sandwich i definitely plan on ordering from here again note to self try the turkey fig,called in an order for a large group with a variety of requests was not dissappointed everything was correct the price is great and the food is fantastic crab benedict caught my eye initially served on a croissant with cajun hollindaise sauce it was everything i hoped and dreamed crab cake with real crab and minimal breading like it should be egg was perfectly poached with a great texture and runny yolk sauce was perfect 2 eggs on 2 halves of the croissant picked it up like a sandwich chose grits for my side and was not disappointed though i did look longingly at the fruit side which was cut up banana and strawberry not the normal melon crap everybody really enjoyed their food even the chick who got a veggie sandwich i definitely plan on ordering from here again note to self try the turkey fig edit came back again the next day and did the thai shrimp poboy and it was excellent plenty of shrimp great flavor on the cole slaw and chili sauce to give it some kick bread was good too also did a blue chick smoothie nice that it had real fruit instead of a mix more of a slushee though since there didn t seem to be any cream in it it was okay but overpriced
2118,if you ve yet to discover circle s bbq you are in for a treat from the brisket to the chicken to the fabulous potato salad never walk away disappointed or hungry
2119,we sat outside and ordered the mussels fried calamari and coconut shrimp everything was yummy our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and prompt food came out hot even though they were busy
2120,i m writing this review based off of just one dish shrimp grits so good two of my friends tried the dish a day before i did and ordered it again the next day with me because it was that good the service was excellent and the food came out really fast probably because we came really early on a tuesday
2121,loved it the food is incredible the pear and gorgonzola flatbread was so delicious as an appetizer that my father ordered a second one for his main and refused to try anything else the artichoke crab cakes were also a favorite but everything we ordered was delicious whether your diet is solely plant based or not you will enjoy your meal here not only is the food good the service is impeccable and the atmosphere lovely we cannot wait to return it is worth every penny
2122,so i appreciate all the reviews you people who eat slowly i am there i finished my capitol cellars dinner from last night tonight i felt all the flavors again very satisfying 2xs
2123,service was fast food was tasty however portions of meal was just ok the sandwich had so much carrots and the meat portion were small i still recommend trying this place out
2124,there s always a long wait but it s for a reason there are options for restricted diets such as vegan and gluten free definitely worth a try
2125,great place for brunch recently came with a group of 12 girls roughly an hour wait but that was to be expected with such a large group of girls hostess took number and while we waited took some pics by angel wings wall coffee was on point as and had a bacon egg and cheese on sour dough which was so good service was great server offered separate checks which is a huge help with a large group we had a party of 3 vegans and everyone was able to find a dish they liked even stopped here again on our last meal before the airport chicken and waffles were amazing hot sauce is to die for
2126,really enjoyable festival one of the top beer events in town and a can t miss if you re sour beer fan the hold back to this event is spacing the event was very difficult to navigate at the beginning of the event due to how it was laid also was disappointed food in vip ran out two hours before event ended before i even got any vip tasting was top notch
2127,a wonderful find thanks to yelp i was on the pier the day before and wouldn t have thought to go up to the tasting room however i m glad that i did the views are awesome from the second floor deck and it is a great place to enjoy the views and a glass of wine i had a glass of the deep sea riesling which was sweet and delicious
2128,got the 8 piece 4 biscuits and fries the best fried food i ve had in new orleans forget about popeyes willie s has similar fresher and better seasoned meals great stuff
2129,i m obsessed with bareburger there is literally something for everyone on the menu when i visited we had someone who was vegan and someone who was gluten free and they both found plenty of options on the menu the have multiple veggie burger options and a very decent tap bottled beer offering
2130,typical broadripple spot industrial decor small portions high prices 13 for 2 small tacos the tacos were decent not a lot of meat but seasoned well pretty good sized bar with a vast selection of liquor and a unique specialty drink menu drinks range from 9 13 overall it was a neat place but not somewhere i would suggest if you have a craving for mexican food and large portions on the other hand if you like the average overpriced broadripple spots and dont mind spending 30 50 for small plates and 2 drinks this is your kinda place,been to broadripple brew pub many times this place is always packed there is usually a wait but its totally worth it its a traditional irish pub with a twist they have many typical irish dishes but also have pizza and other options as well you have to try the scottish eggs they are probably the best ive ever had prices are reasonable atmosphere is great service is usually pretty good we had an issue with our server the last time we were there she obviously did not want to be there other than that its typically been a great experience
2131,just an average bagel place my breakfast sandwich hit the spot bacon egg and cheese on a blueberry bagel but my boyfriend s hash brown was mushy service was average and the line was confusing for someone who has never been here before the line starts to the right of the counter you order you then make your way around to the left to pay if the staff ever takes your payment it s almost as if they don t want you to pay because every customer literally had to ask the staff to take their payment,sunday brunch is where it s at i came in wanting nachos and was a bit disappointed that i had to order from a pre fixe brunch menu that did not include nachos but i was hungry and open minded 18 for a two course brunch including a great coffee which could be served hotter i ordered the cobb salad and breakfast burrito excellent portions and of course always tasty fresh food these vegetarian meals never disappoint i highly recommend for a non typical brunch,i am always satisifed after leaving blue sage and the food is always delicious and presented nicely the nachos are excellent my only gripe i don t like that my server kept my wine cork apparently they keep them until we are done but other tables were given their cork back i asked for my cork was not given it at the end of my meal i was given a cork to a different bottle i find that odd
2132,we were customers here we were there at least two times a month maybe more they recently changed the menu our son is autistic he can t handle change he just declared we won t go to the ale house until they have mozzarella sticks back on the menu please put it on the menu so we can enjoy a meal out again
2133,unique thai place pros the green bean noodles are quite good though i ve never seen them at other thai places portions are big cons the service isn t great always feels hard to get waitstaff s attention it s more expensive than other spots the tables are too close together
2134,really enjoyed first time in very relaxing saturday afternoon the chicken sandwich was really good bacon and cheddar and i added avocado very solid wife got tuna on rye good fresh bread and simple tuna salad not made by a chef with dill and eggs and blah blah blah just tuna mayo and a little s p son had bologna sandwich well made all were big enough didn t really need side plenty of drink choices from main stream to exotic i will come again sat outside in the shade with our dog all good
2135,i recently spent two weeks in boise and was lucky enough to eat out a lot from greasy burgers to french cuisine i had it all for me personally capitol cellars was the best meal i had everything was wonderful but my prime rib was incredible for comparison i had just eaten at what most consider to be the best steakhouse in boise and to be honest the steak i had at said restaurant was one of the worse i ve ever eaten so thankfully my soon to be wife she s currently unaware that she is lol suggested capitol cellars as my last meal and it was everything and more service was excellent and they always had someone checking in on us dean is a terrific person great server and had us smiling all night solid wine list to include a lot of yummy oregon pinot s i can t recommend this place enough and i look forward to going back
2136,an unassuming place from the exterior that looks like an old wawa or 7 11 but inside they make some of the best breakfast sandwiches platters to go this time around my son and i split the lucky 7 belly buster which is 4 eggs pork roll sausage hash brown cheese on a 10 inch hoagie sub roll and it more than filled us both a great value at 5 99 this place is also one of the very few pennsylvania locations carries boost a central new jersey based soft drink you can get it as a slushie regular or by the half gallon jar in syrup form to make at home
2137,excellent late night mexican bean dip with chips fantastic taco packs in a variety of selections yes beer that too eat here often
2138,i don t normally eat fast food but i used to know someone that was the ceo of both captain d s and shoney s i used to ask him if he ever ate the food and he said yes and it s good today i stopped at one place and it was closed on mondays silly restaurant so i stopped a few doors down at captain d s at noon i was adamant i won t lie fast food is the death of humans but they ve been advertising flounder today i decided to try it i went in and ordered the blackened flounder with a skewer of shrimp coleslaw and green beans i also ordered the fried oysters and butterfly shrimp total was 12 i went and sat down and a young lady brought me my meal on a heavy plastic plate not paper the food wasn t hot it was warm palatable the amount of food was surprising i didn t bother with the thing that looked like a fried submarine or the rice but i ate all the protein and vegetables and i was full really full also could be from the gluten on the fried shrimp oysters gluten does blow your belly up to make you look like your about 7 months pregnant the meal was good in a quick moment it was a very good variety of food and it had taste i wouldn t do this often but in a bind this is as good as a waffle house as far as fresh food and inventory moving quickly and this particular restaurant was clean and the employees were very nice i even got some smiles from everyone good choice for quick food this restaurant in particular was a good choice glad nadine s was closed today otherwise i never would have stopped here try the flounder delicious
2139,love the flavors and attention to detail but the parking situation is confusing and prices are a bit high for street tacos
2140,this restaurant looks a bit older on the outside and the building is quite deceiving i would have never guessed without google and yelp that this was a vietnamese restaurant i came here for lunch wanting soup for my cold i ordered the chicken curry and it was delicious they were generous on the chicken vermicelli was abundant and two large slices of potato in a very tasty broth that wasn t too spicy i thoroughly enjoyed this soup very much will return again
2141,the atmosphere was nice but laid back we didn t have to wait at 7 on a tues the food was okay it may be what we ordered the quinoa burger was mushy i do not suggest it the oysters were undercooked but seemed fresh fast service but could have been more personable
2142,the food was decent not like i expected from all the photos the actual restraunt itself is nice and clean but it was very warm in there making it uncomfortable to enjoy the food the eggs benedict was pretty good but my boyfriend s biscuit and gravy was not so much
2143,took my family for a little sunday evening treat and thought we d give this place a try everyone loved it we will definitely come back again location was easy to find clean and good seating options that also included outside tables it was like going to a small ice cream shop we parked on the street in front the only reason i didn t give it 5 stars was because they had very limited drink options hot coffee iced coffee hot chocolate and milk water was free you definitely get thirsty eating this tasty treat as other reviewers have mentioned it was very filling i got two scoops but one would have been plenty i ate about half and i will have the leftovers tomorrow i got one scoop of chocolate chip and one scoop of peanut butter both were good but chocolate chip was my favorite if you are looking for a sweet treat i definitely recommend giving this place a try
2144,chicken fingers were good the sauce was great had the right mixture of spiceyness and flavor didnt see anything else but chicken fingers on menu
2145,very impressed room was huge kitchen and all very clean front desk was really outgoing only annoying things were elevators took forever and the cleaning company knocked way before check out time asking us our check out time just found that weird you d assumed they d know noticed that was an issue on some other reviews otherwise everything was awesome definitely recommended
2146,my husband accompanied thomas during the inspection of our new home thomas was very courteous professional and knowledgeable his inspection was thorough and in addition to advising us of what needed immediate attention he provided detailed information concerning what problems we might expect in the future and what actions to take to avoid such problems he even made himself available after the inspection to further explain his findings and the methods used we are so happy with our purchase and we are very grateful for your services we look forward to working with you again and highly recommend you thank you burnell and faith
2147,it s always difficult to find and depend on good chinese delivery that is consistent and i am very picky i can say every time i have ordered from here it has been right on the spot i am a lo mein fan and it always comes out right and the specialty dishes are fabulous too as for the delivery it is extremely fast i d say between 20 30min this is to south tampa what s great is their drivers are usually the same and are very complimentary that you ordered from top china give this place a go
2148,beignets music and history all in one place outdoor so a bit chilly at times and a bit pricey but overall nice
2149,so yummy with so many flavors we got here 5 minutes before it closed and there was a huge line we got to stay past 10 thankfully the toppings are 50 cents extra each kind of rediculous but she put on a ton of sprinkles soooo that made up for the extra cost the ice cream is really good and the whole place smells amazing i highly recommend
2150,this is the place for all your fresh seafood as well as dining in everything is delicious and freshly prepared we are a regular client chester is the man he makes this place rock
2151,meh good drunk food nothing to blow your mind trips smokes their food all day but this place has a big following people grew up on it and love it give it a shot it may be your thing
2152,wow unique rly cool vibes our waitress was super helpful and the menu was so creative i ve never seen a menu like it sis i wanted to try everything so we split 5 plates but everything that kept coming out we just stared at and our mouths were watering the whole time such a fun spot probs one of my top recs in indy
2153,love love love this place cool upcoming neighborhood limited parking great beer happy bartenders and pet friendly did i mention great beer ya gotta drop in here just too many great tasting experiences to write down and always changing if your on a beer tour come here first and get spoiled
2154,the store is huge and very busy saturday and sundays are absolute zoo s so ty to go during the week if you don t like crowds one thing that bugs me is the parking lot i go to tool rental a lot and these morons are always parking right in the middle of the road where you load fence panels and the employees let them do it i had to sit in my truck and wait 10 minutes for these guys to load wood onto their trailer right in the middle of the road and a delivery guy in a 18 wheeler behind me actually got out of his truck and went inside to complain stop letting people load and park wherever they hell they want to the employees in the rental department are awesome they are knowledgeable friendly and know their stuff kevin and joe know what theyre doing and always recommend the best thing i need to finish my job theres a few new people in there that aren t as knowledgeable but that comes with time this review would ve been 2 stars if it wasn t for k j in the rental dept out in the store its hard to find employees for help but that s corporate for ya always understaff pay them as little as possible and keep a revolving door open for once they get sick of it and they need to hire someone else if corporate places like hd would pay their employees more they would stick around longer and work harder it aint rocket surgery people however i did download their app and its pretty cool and helpful it tells you where the item youre looking for is how many they have and even what shelf its on
2155,great service great food lots of options everything came out quickly after two days of enduring horrendous hotel breakfast we decided to venture out for a monday morning meal google s busy times told me that early mornings were slower than late mornings so we got there at around 8 45 and only had two other parties in front of us it amounted to a less than 5 minute wait the restaurant is set up as one big open room with booths tables running along the sides and lots of tables in the middle our party of three was seated in the middle there s not a whole lot in terms of decoration except some pancake related art and what looked like an amateur painting of a whale our server was friendly and really on the ball we didn t have much conversation with her because she was busy but that s fine she took our order quickly got our food to the table quickly and made sure to check in with us once we had a few bites in there is a lot of variety on the menu pancakes of all kinds duh omelets waffles hash browns french toast i also love that they have meals that include a few different items eggs pancakes and toast or sausage eggs and pancakes for example i chose to order the grill cook s medley which includes a giant mound of hash browns theirs are more potato chunk style with ham and veggies melted swiss american cheese wheat toast two eggs cooked any way you want i do sunny side up and two pancakes it ordinarily comes with regular buttermilk pancakes but i chose to substitute with sweet potato pancakes for the price 14 it was a lot of food and very filling the pancakes were fluffy and i loved the sweet potato flavor the eggs were perfectly yolky which was awesome over the hash browns i also got a taste of my boyfriend s chocolate chip pancakes if you love your pancakes with extra chocolate chips these are the ones to order they re topped with so much chocolate for me it was almost too much but the other person at our table who ordered them loved it we also got orange juice i m not sure if it s fresh squeezed but it tasted fresh and had just a minimal amount of pulp i don t know if i d wait in an hour long line for this place but it was definitely satisfying,tasty ice cream conveniently located quick and friendly service this ice cream shop is located on one of the side streets right off of lower broadway it s easy to find because they have a couple of big ice cream sculptures right outside their door i chose to get a double scoop in a cup with whipped cream on top one scoop of blackberry cornbread and one scoop of banana pudding the banana pudding was amazing very creamy and a very real banana pudding taste i hate the taste of artificial banana the blackberry cornbread was gross to be honest i got it because it sounded weird well one bite into the chewy cornbread i was done it did not work for me at all
2156,i order from this place about once a week if not more because that s how much i love it the food is so good it never gets old to me ive never felt this way about healthy food before in my life not even kidding while they have many deliciously fresh options the turkey avocado wrap is always a crowd pleaser highly recommend
2157,great breakfast service was top notch the portions were huge if you want a great breakfast stop in good coffee too
2158,i came here with a group of friends who have a variety of dietary restrictions the staff were very accommodating in modifying dishes and the service was quick the food tasted amazing as well
2159,beautiful work i get all of my shoes repaired and resoled here
2160,traditional japanese ramen shop with 10 varieties of ramen on the menu including tonkotsu shoyu miso and spicy ramen starting around 9 with optional extra toppings a full service restaurant friendly and fast service great place to stop for lunch they get busy but don t plan on waiting long
2161,this place has solid food and great specials lots of beer to choose from and happy hour for breakfast the pancakes are amazing
2162,pleasant surprise our new favorite gulch spot the short rib gnocchi was amazing and my girlfriend had the short rib grilled cheese from the lunch menu which was equally amazing in its own right for dessert we tried the ricotta cheesecake which was perfectly sweet and savory i highly recommend these items and imagine everything else on the menu is fabulous as well cheers
2163,this place is delicious i prefer this place over chipotle now they have a greater variety then chipotle and their portions are significantly larger they have amazing guacamole i always do the bowl but i m excited to try out burritos and other different things highly recommend
2164,what s not to love the food the decor the plates and cups the service the chickpea hummus was fantastic and comes with pita the rose latte was fabulous
2165,it is such a quaint little place that i felt like i should be wearing white gloves and a sunday hat we had the pot of tea and there are plenty of selections we had the earl grey and lavendar tea the earl grey waa wonderful and lavendar tea was okay it smelled more than tasted like lavendar but it was good for a cold day i had the vegetable quiche with a spring salad and homemade biscuits with homemade jam if you are in clearwater you should atop by there is also a marketplace to buy sweets and wait until they have your table
2166,we ve been here many times and have never been disappointed other than the fact that word has gotten out about it and it can be crowded at times it quirky and cute service is always decent and has a good menu everything we ve tried has been good but our favorites are the pickle soup mixed salad sandwich royal grille and dark and sinister dessert
2167,frank s moved to alton yesterday so we gave it a try much nicer and updated facility i got a tour of the kitchen with new gas stoves pizza oven large prep area and serving area menu has new items and prices are more too specials are in the near future overall i expect frank s to bloom if they remember their roots a place where seniors go for good food conversation and good prices
2168,had a very good experience here on saturday beautiful day to sit outside and watch the bad golf and the cool skydivers food was solid salmon blt for me and service was good i ll go back again
2169,overall a decent experience while i have had better omlettes the service was good the restaurant was clean and the live music was good i made reservations and got there when it opened for brunch i probably would of been fine at opening to e without reservations
2170,i echo the same sentiment that if you havent really had any type of gourmet donut you will love these i think the flavors are interesting and creative but the actual dough is bland and made without sugar if you get the donuts get the extra fancy which are cream filled and usually tastier i will say that their sandwiches and burgers are really good flavored just right good ingredients
2171,we always make a trip here when we are on the north side of indy they always have a great selection of beer available they also always have free popcorn no other food for purchase but you can bring your own or order from takeout menus they have dog friendly watch out for the brew bus they commonly visits it can get pretty busy when they show up the employees are good at warning people before their arrival
2172,kajun s pub is a dive bar simply for those who just want to come have a drink do karaoke and go home it is a great place to hang out with the escape from the madness of bourbon street with a college bar vibe drinks are priced reasonably and the bartenders provide excellent service the star of this show is karaoke however there is a no repeat policy there is also a small stage near the karaoke booth unlike most bars the bathrooms are clean as a whistle the dj has a bit of a jekyll and hyde attitude but if you can tolerate it and follow the rules your time at kajuns will be enjoyable
2173,stopped by for lunch had the tres tacos with cilantro rice absolutely delicious huge portions also had the homemade ginger ale and loved it great value i will definitely be back the next time i am in reno overall the best lunch i have had in a long time,tried a bunch of items everything was great loved the deep fried steak will definitely be back the next time i am in reno
2174,this review is only for the donuts and coffee i selected the almond joy donut and iced vanilla latte we came here based on all the reviews on yelp and it could have been a miss due to the donut offerings of that day 8 varieties 4 specialties such as neapolitan late night snack etc and 4 somewhat normal selections such as glaze cinnamon roll etc i was looking for the vietnamese coffee flavor or blueberry flavored donut but they didn t have either the almond joy donut was a disappointment it tasted like any other donut i ve tasted before i was looking for more of a coconut and almond taste the iced vanilla latte was okay as well
2175,update i found this exactly candle set at home goods with only 5 candle votives and the tray for only 7 obviously this is overpriced and not so unique bummer
2176,great food great service frank was very attentive and helpful food was delicious sat outside nice breeze watched the guy smoke the meats loved the pulled pork and sausages and the potatoe salad and and very good sweet potato pie would return when in the area again
2177,great date night place i can t say enough about the fried green tomatoes and the beet salad
2178,veggie pizza is the best they have a lot of different choices to choose from olus if you want something different then what s on the menu they will make it no problem best pizza in the area
2179,omg this was so yummy im here from atlanta for work and this was so amazing i will be back for sure,what a gem i love a good shrimp taco these are definitely an authentic shrimp taco im usually not a huge fan of corn tortillas but these were actually very good i love how you can select your own toppings and the pickled onions were such a good choice the jamaica was good too staff was very friendly as well if i lived in philly this would be my good to place
2180,we got lunch there at 12 pm the service was fast and friendly i got the caesar salad with shrimp shrimp were big and it was delicious
2181,great service by neil he was so good to my son and paid attention to whatever we needed had a wonderful birthday brunch perfection location wonderful food and great mimosas would highly recommend
2182,going to rethink stopping here again we have been to several pieology locations and have always had great service and a great meal still got great meal but their customer service needs a refresh and change i wasn t greeted with a hello just a blank stare the hello i gave was met with same blank annoyed gaze and a do you want salad or pizza the rest of the process was went as planned ordered a drink went to fill the cup and there s no ice i let the manager i m assuming this know and he replies with yep it s not working today that s it nothing else a heads up when he handed me the cup would have been nice or a note on the machine might saved him from being bothered clearly it did to have to repeat this as i wasn t the only one to say something he did tell another customer he would refund his money if he didn t want to have all the extra liquid in his cup we love pieology we ll just hold off until we travel further south for another visit
2183,went for breakfast on a monday 20 minute wait but bypassed that by sitting at the bar great menu biscuits were great had biscuit egg bacon and cheese and fried chicken egg cheese biscuit coffee was great nice environment
2184,i hadn t been there in a few years but nothing has changed much in terms of the quality of the food and service the food was delicious and the service was fast i ate the chicken slouvaki pita sandwich and it was really good a little messy to eat but worth it the prices are reasonable and there is choice for everyone they do have daily specials i will definitely be back
2185,great hotel location and proximity to everything was fantastic service was great especially kimmy she was incredibly kind attentive and helpful
2186,seasonal japanese cuisine great sake selection and wonderful service if you are interested in japanese fine dining give yoichi s a try
2187,i enjoyed a nice lunch at luke s during a recent visit to louisiana i ordered jumbo lump crab ravigote with toasted ciabatta bread the crab was excellent the only thing is it comes with a horse radish dressing mixed into the crab and it was very strong if i went again i would not order it with the dressing although i m not certain it can be extracted the corn and crab fritters are a delightful taste of seafood but crunchy enough to pass for a stand alone afternoon snack the crispy brussels sprouts were fresh and in season and had great texture to the meal
2188,saw this place had good reviews and wanted to try the drinks don t look as dressed up in person as it does in the photos but they are good i got the shatkys rum punch and loved it not on the beach but close so you can enjoy some drinks and head to the beach across the street and vice versa service is very friendly as well would reccomend
2189,wow what to say the selection is so unique and absolutely delectable the menu is so different than most places but one of a kind we ve gone several times and every time has been a great experience from food to service space is a little tight but very sweet lighting and fairly intimate we ll be back for sure
2190,if you visit reno you need to attend this little gem in the heart of downtown it s located close the the river walk movie theater and is nestled on the perfect street for a nice quality lunch the soup was to die for and the food tasted so amazingly good i will definitely return the owner was friendly and made time to greet people the service was fast and friendly
2191,not bad but not great we arrived around 6 and went to the roof top we were wanting a table outside and the waitress was pretty rude about letting us know where we could not sit funny thing is that when we left an hour later it was still empty not a great start blake let s break it down atmosphere 3 stars nothing special about the interior or rooftop the downstairs area has a nice stage but the entire restaurant has a commercial feel to it i considered it average for broadway service 4 stars our waitress was very pleasant she was helpful and attentive no issue here food 4 stars it s bar food but pretty darn good i consider it above average i had the trio sliders the pork was very tasty the bologna sandwich yes they still make these a we really good and clever lastly the hamburger was solid my wife had the pimento cheese wrapped in mozzarella really well done value 3 stars for basically two appetizers and four beers we left with a 60 bill alittle high for what you get but considering it is in the heart of broadway probably pretty typical all in all it was ok i would give it 3 5 but yelp won t allow me to do that it s definitely slightly above average and i would come back
2192,cute restaurant free parking across the street everyone was happy with their meal except my mother who wasn t crazy about the half chicken it was over cooked and dry my nashville chicken was delicious i got the sauce on the side and the flavor and crunchy texture of the chicken itself was fantastic fried pickles were good although i wish a little more seasoned and well done i wish the prices were a little cheaper to match the quality and portions
2193,being a college student in isla vista is a pretty amazing time i let all the fun get to me and decided to drive to get some food after drinking at a party they noticed my driving was a little funky and they pulled me over for turning without signaling i failed the fsts and blew a 18 on the breathalyzer my case was pretty tough but thankfully they gave me a misdemeanor for not hurting anybody with my reckless behavior i found the h law group through yelp and after my consultation i was sold everything worked out for me because of the payment plan they offer the attorney that was assigned to my case was arnold he did his best and got them to reduce my sentencing by a lot more than i expected this firm is definitely worth the price you pay
2194,this place was cute and quaint the lady who checked us in was new to the area but gave us all kinds of recommendations and suggestions bed s comfortable grounds well kept and fun little back patios on each room great place to sit and have some wine from the bottles you may have bought along the wine tasting trails also had the continental breakfast which included an array of muffins and beverages place needs a bit of love ice machine wasn t functioning when we were there and my friend also had an overnight bathroom issue and no staff was available to assist or be on call would definitely stay here again great location to all important areas
2195,the food was good prices good and the server was really sweet will definitely go again it s small inside so you feel very cozy with your neighbors hope to get seats at the bar next time
2196,update since that first negative experience we have eaten here at least 10 more times every experience since the first one has been fantastic the food is always consistently amazing the service is typically great that first waitress must have left we have eaten at a lot of sushi places in nashville and franklin and umami continues to be our favorite we will definitely continue eating here initial review we were so excited to eat here the restaurant that was here before this place was sushi me and that was our favorite spot we were welcomed right away by the new owner when we arrived she was very kind and informed us that they still have the same sushi chef that sushi me had greatest news ever to us i will say everything we ordered was amazing some of the greatest sushi in nashville in our opinion however the waitress we were given is one of the worst waitresses we have ever had in our lives by checking in there for the first time on yelp you can claim a free egg roll so we ordered that soon after arriving and then we placed our drink orders and sushi order we had to repeat the sushi order 3 times she wasn t even familiar with the menu i ordered moscato i had to show it to her on the menu because she didn t know what that was same with the beer order it wasn t a lack of understanding us at all it s like she has never heard of any item from their menu we sat there for at least 30 minutes with no drinks and no egg roll i noticed that our drinks had been sitting up on the bar ready for her to bring to us this waitress was running around appearing to be messing up other customers tickets and orders she kept having to get the manager her other tables maybe 2 other tables looked very aggravated as we did i was almost to the point of going up to the bar and getting our drinks we finally caught her attention and asked about our drinks she had definitely forgot and went to go get them i asked about the egg roll she forgot about that too and never put the order in she assured it would be out soon the place was busy so we had to wait longer than usual for our sushi but that was understandable finally our sushi arrived but no egg roll i asked if we could have that too she forgot she assured it would be out soon i will say again the sushi was delicious we finished all 4 rolls and finished our drinks the waitress never once came to check on us and see if we needed anything we finally caught her attention after sitting there for quite awhile with our empty plates and glasses and we told her we were ready for the check and that egg roll she forgot she asked if maybe we could just get our egg roll next time are you kidding me i said no we ordered it over an hour ago we want it now we actually wanted it before our meal she just walked away about another 10 minutes later she comes out with the ticket and the egg roll in the meantime one of her other 2 tables was getting irritated and went up to owner asking for their ticket she never said thank you to us or sorry for our long wait or anything in conclusion this waitress made our experience here terrible we wasted a lot of our friday night sitting and waiting to be served it was ridiculous we definitely want to come back here because we are in love with the quality of the food and we liked the atmosphere but if we are ever given this waitress again we will demand a different one all of the other waiters and waitresses seemed to be doing an excellent job but this place is going to continue to have angry customers if they don t do something about this horrible waitress we weren t the only ones unhappy last night
2197,adam and his team is great on time incredibly courteous and great work all that and a great price 60 less than i was quoted from a window repair company if you need new screens for your windows call him
2198,came to sun diner on friday morning to be met by the most awesome waitress jillian great atmosphere awesome awesome staff food is so good and something for everyone thanks jillian you made our experience so so much fun

2202,i had a pretty good experience here i came here after my graduation on a saturday food was pretty good i suggest the crab cakes they were amazing also really enjoyed the fire show the only down is that the place needs a little updating on the decor and they are a little pricy other than that it was pretty nice i d go again
2203,been here several times for wheels and tinting great service and fair prices no complaints
2204,this place was delicious had an amazing view down to earth staff and attentive service my wife and i both got lobster rolls and a beer couldn t have been much better

2207,wow i looked at my sandwiches and was amazed at the volume of meat on them then i took bites and was amazed at the quality and flavor of the meat and of the toppings i tried to go to blues city deli for lunch last friday but as i drove up to it at 11 40 the line was already down past the long end of the bldg since i didn t have that long a lunch needed to still drive back to the office and didn t know how quickly the line moved i settled for something less however i resolved to order ahead for the next friday and that s what i did good thing i decided to try to call in my order fairly early the phone message says you have to order before 10 am and pick it up before 11 am when i arrived at about 10 50 there were already about 10 people in line i tried the front door and it was locked and with no signs about how to pick up orders i was stymied there was a side door which i tried but it also was locked i then stood outside for a couple minutes and fortunately saw someone open another door at the far back end of the bldg side that unmarked door is where you cut through the kitchen to get to the counter and pick up your order who da thunk anyway my sandwiches were already wrapped and bagged so i paid and skedaddled back to the office i ordered a mike s spicy beef n cheddar hot roast beef bacon sharp cheddar lettuce tomato onion smoky spicy delta sauce italian rolls and a large 12 oz prez reuben new york style pastrami swiss sauerkraut thousand island dressing a pickle spear rye it was more than i needed but i knew it might be tough to get back there and i wanted to try a couple of recommended sandwiches first thing i noticed after i unwrapped them was that they were really stacked high with meat for pretty inexpensive sandwiches and the meat was high quality too lots of flavor good spice and tender especially nice on the pastrami with them having rendered the fat down without ruining the meat both sandwiches were hot which of course releases even more flavor the spicy beef n cheddar had enough sauce to make it run down my hands some but not so much to just make a mess and the smoky spice description sums it up pretty well not overpowering but enough substance to satisfy bacon was easily bitten through and the lettuce tomato onion all held their position the roll was fresh but substantial enough to hold all that meat toppings and juice a top notch sandwich and then the prez reuben just completely matched it the bread is buttered and grilled up panini style to again hold all that meat and toppings too pastrami was very tender and i think it was cut into smaller pieces so you didn t take a bite and have half the meat drag out with it very thick layer of pastrami on there sauerkraut wasn t overly glommed on so it gave flavor without overpowering and same with the thousand island it was all well balanced and savory savory savory i can see why there s such a line make time to get yourself some
2208,great place to eat food was good and cici took care of us like we were family she made sure we were good multiple times and immediately corrected any mistakes
2209,awesome saturday lunch here my party was seated with no wait even on the touristy part of town the restaurant was very clean and the service was friendly and prompt food 3 po boys came out super hot and quickly the dressed shrimp poboy was delicious the onion rings were a little greasy but still good yum fun decor and bar too
2210,after our steamboat jazz cruise we dropped by desire for a late lunch we had charbroiled oysters on half shells jambalaya and shrimp etoufee all the foods are delicious we even had the chocolate cake for dessert again we accepted the fact that cajun creole foods are salty but the seafood is very fresh and good eats this spot was recommended by a local whom we met at another restaurant
2211,we are from phoenix and tried the fish tacos here and they are very very good alot of fish for the money better than rubio s which we like alot as well
2212,kind of a hit and miss place depending on what you order we got the santa fe pancakes and the sweet potato pancakes santa fe was absolutely delicious i loved the mia of maple syrup and sour cream and salsa toppings sweet potato was a bit of a let down because it didn t actually taste anything like sweet potatoes at all haha we were so surprised we d thought they d gotten our order wrong but when we asked them they explained it s because they don t mash sweet potatoes to make them they use sweet potato flakes
2213,such a great experience hot cider with grand marnier live local music everybody near and far with a cool motocycle to show off was there nice people and got to try the real santa maria tri tip sandwich bbq on the big outdoor grill with french roll and salsa and horseradish delish fun being out in nature with the spring wildflowers all popping up and feeling part of history visiting such a special place
2214,since bae was paying i of course decided to go completely crazy and eat an entire el fortachon alambre by myself dear god a whole plate with multiple meats and like 20 tortillas even a meat lover like myself was stuffed i still of course ate the whole thing it was a great portion for less than 10 and would have easily fed two people and not just one greedy glutton like myself everything tasted comforting and well cooked
2215,we had a great experience eating here loved the guac made on the table drinks were good and our server manuel was very attentive to everything we needed looking forward to come back next time we are in the area
2216,holy cow best food experience in st petersburg crazy fast getting our food both appetizers and main meal all members of our party remarked how good and how fast the service was our waitress was amber highly recommend this place prices were very reasonable

2220,awesome breakfast we had a huge group on a saturday morning service was fast friendly and food was amazing very reasonable too
2221,this is a great beer distributor prices are very reasonable they don t overcharge you as the distributors in philly i actually pay 10 00 less for a case of beer than what i ve paid at the beer distributor in my neighborhood i haven t gone anywhere else since they opened
2222,good service where i used to live the drive thru at kfc took 10 minutes here although there were four cars ahead of me only took 2 or 3 minutes the order was right hot and oh so good
2223,enjoyed the lunch and experience chowder bread bowl onion rings and all crab plates solid dining time 20 30 min wait for lunch no issues take out options on south side of restaurant step back in time we ll be back
2224,my wife and i have stayed at the inn at bowman s hill three times now most recently last week following our wedding we checked in on a monday afternoon and were greeted by mike the innkeeper who is one of the friendliest and most generous people you will ever meet he and his staff made sure our bags were brought up to our room as we checked in the room we stayed in was the general washington suite which was the most impressive of all the rooms we ve stayed in thus far the orchard retreat and english manor suite were very nice as well the bedroom was very spacious despite having a king bed and two leather reclining chairs connected to the bedroom is a small hallway that leads to a beautiful bathroom with a large tub and adjacent shower the room was very accommodating and included two televisions a stocked mini fridge and a keurig both mornings we had our breakfast brought up to our room and ate outside on the private deck that leads straight out from our bedroom and overlooks the beautiful grounds and swimming pool the breakfast prepared by the inn was phenomenal and more than enough food your entree you order the prior night fresh fruit muffins toasts coffee oj etc at night we checked out the restaurant down the hill bowman s tavern at the recommendation of mike and were blown away by how good the food was so much that we dined there the second night as well during the daytime when we weren t looking through the stores downtown new hope we just wanted to relax and the inn s swimming pool and hot tub were all we needed the pool was heated to the perfect temperature and we found ourselves going back for a dip several times each day the inn is the perfect spot for a romantic getaway and one we will be visiting for years to come chris and melissa
2225,loved the bourbon flight bartender was attentive and another bartender offered his opinion on the bourbon when he asked very friendly atmosphere
2226,so glad yelp reviews brought me here sat at the bar by myself hit dinner friendly attentive bartender nice cocktail list the shrimp risotto was perfection creamy garlicky perfectly cooked fresh shrimp would order again in a heartbeat no outdoor seating but lovely views of the water would be a wonderful spot for date night
2227,this place definitely feeds into that overhype for a restaurant in which the ambiance is cute but the seating is limited the food is pretty but only good and not deserving for the price you pay the service is pretty decent and the ingredients seems pretty fresh if you re going for a cute place to brunch i d pick other locations that come up when you search if it s a weekday and this is convenient than i probably would be okay going here but i definitely would not recommend it to be worth the trip on the weekends
2228,this place was as quaint as can be right in the middle of doylestown inside the doylestown inn the vibe is pretty cool with a speakeasy touch mirrors and chandeliers hanging around for sale service was excellent food came out super fast and was delicious we made reservations ahead and they had our table ready 10 mins before we got seated ordered our drinks and food and it took maybe 10 mins before the food was out the arugula salad with chipotle shrimp and goat cheese was amazing
2229,this is a really nice establishment would definitely be a great place to host events i was there for a day party featuring a podcast i listen to only thing i have an issue with is the highs in speakers you are guaranteed to leave with ringing ears
2230,i haven t been here since before i could drive so i had no idea what i was getting into ha but the process is super easy 1 parking you can park for free in their parking garage and then take the sky bridge over into the museum 2 tickets you can buy online or there 3 the museum there are four or fiveish levels with different activities per floor there s anywhere from mummies and dinosaurs to culture and science to a chocolate slide almost everything is free the carousel costa a dollar to ride and you have to get a token out of a machine but of course it s crazy full of kids and parents and learning we went during a weekday and it wasn t too crazy makes for a very fun 3 4 hours running around
2231,a craft beer oasis solid selection and they go the distance to provide customers with a diverse selections of local brews price gouging something becoming more commonplace in bottle shops especially with trending styles of beer is not something that happens here kudos to the management i was looking around for awhile and someone did offer me help which was nice there was a sampling table set up in the store when i went in so they must have some events from time to time i will be a return customer
2232,amazing food the beet salad was wonderful and the brussel sprout appetizer lived up to the other reviews my husband had the trout and i had the white wine pork both entrees were reasonably priced and very good the waiter was efficient and friendly and the food was served in a timely fashion despite a packed house the only drawback is that it was very noisy however a very small price to pay for such a great meal and service
2233,very good authentic mexican food tamales are excellent and always fresh i m a regular at this place great prices and good service quick service nice atmosphere
2234,we visited this location while on vacation in new orleans sunshine made fudge sang and entertained us the whole time my kids kept saying how this was the best fudge they have ever had it was smooth and delicious not at all dry or grainy like other places i was very impressed with the customer service as well we bought several flavors to take home it is too difficult to pick just one i would definitely recommend stopping in
2235,i expected more i m writing this review after multiple visits the most amazing thing i had was the fried fish it was legendary i was disappointed with the flavoring of the pasta that came along with the fish it was surprisingly very bland and tasted like it was previously frozen i wanted more flavor wings are very good i tried the lettuce wraps and was surprised at the small sized meat portion for the price you can t go wrong with any of the desserts they all were good dishes seemed to be a little overpriced to me i don t mind paying for a good meal and experience at all but the food for the prices just don t add up to me drinks are also a little pricey
2236,we ve used mitch for the last 2 years now and he does a great job every time we won t use anyone else and i refer his concepts to all my friends
2237,i love this little deli my first thought was gas station food is bad but i was so wrong the food is fresh and delicious the portions are huge the gyros wont even close they have been featured in the local paper and i must say i think they are right this place is great
2238,i ve been to fries a few times each time the food was on point and the spot itself is cool service varies depending on who you get but they re never rude i won t hesitate to go back for future visits
2239,you have to be quick and have a game plan to catch a seat in this place it s super tiny and you may find a chair or two up against your table but it s all worth it the menu is out your grandma s kitchen and so is the charm that comes with just about everything looks good and tastes good but go ahead and get the trout topped with a generous mound of crabmeat with red beans that have been cooking since early morning and the m c a cornerstone of any comfort food resto not fancy or fussy but still a nola gem
2240,best thai food around you won t be disappointed the tom yum noodle soup is delicious i m addicted warning not for people who can t do spicy the pad thai is so good as well
2241,i had been planning to visit as i saw all of the positive reviews here and finally went for lunch yesterday i had the chicken adobo and menudo and it was great the items were seasoned well and was very flavorful i will definitely go back often
2242,this is my favorite place to get my tex mex on their service is always great the food is consistently good and the happy hour and daily loco deals are ever better try the delectable dip sampler empanadas are soft flaky and flavorful the portions are huge,the atmosphere is nice and casual the service was friendly however i was unimpressed with the food the dishes we tried had a strong tomato base and it just made the flavors weird the beef itself was nice and tender the rice had stale grains mixed throughout my bf didn t enjoy the fried plantains or his coffee all that much we skipped dessert
2243,the restaurant was very cute the staff was friendly and helpful the food that we had was good nothing overly special but solid we were perhaps disappointed because we had heard it was great drinks were made with fresh ingredients and were very good
2244,awesome helped me out with windshield wipers put them on for me this has become my go to auto parts store
2245,wonderful staff and atmosphere we went with a very large group and everyone s entree was outstanding and don t miss the dessert
2246,in town from nyc to pick up my best friend s wedding dress from a nearby salon we yelped for a local spot for lunch and decided to give wag a try the whole menu looked so tasty it was hard to make a choice we started with the hummus and pita serving was beyond generous pita was nice and soft i had the mama s breakfast sandwich my friend ordered the avocado toast and mac and cheese for my 4 year old avocado toast looked great but was gone by the time i even finished cutting around the massive chicken breast hanging over the biscuit on my sandwich the sandwich itself was amazing even if the serving size was absurd the kids mac and cheese was straight up boxed kraft i m a mom i know what i m looking at sweet potato fries and waffle fries were good if we lived nearby we d be regulars they could do better with kid options though
2247,my husband and i stumbled upon cafe piazza for sunday brunch we ordered an omelette and sicilian frittata service and food were delicious topped this off with doughnuts and nutella also enjoyed tim elmore playing guitar and singing
2248,first time here and i m not disappointed great seasoning on the seafood i ordered oysters and their 45 combo and some garlic chicken wings for a family of six it was more than enough for us only thing i can complain about is she messed up on our order
2249,i truely love this place i will definitely visit this place upon my return sorry i should have made this review 4 months ago
2250,the best french toast i have ever tried in my life i want everyone and their mothers to try it right now ps someone pls bring me some to miami
2251,i ve been here twice with 2 different people working each time and have not been dissapointed very nice people and great treats i enjoy the atmosphere inside and outside
2252,the first time i ve ever been here and not had a concrete tried a chocolate malt and it was good too
2253,man this place is so good we had the carne asada quesadillas and the coconut shrimp tacos from the appetizer menu both were excellent chips with delicious salsa are complimentary before the meal they serve made to order at your table guacamole we did not order but it looked amazing quesadillas are very cheesy and so yummy flavourful filling tacos have 3 mini shells aka street tacos but there s enough stuff on each one to separate and really end up with 6 mini tacos also the coconut shrimp are lightly breaded so they are not all breading plus they bring you black beans and rice with your meal so good
2254,well organized auto parts store envious of those who have newer cars i was on hot pursuit to beautify my 18 year old toyota and hopeful that if i treat it well it would treat me well back i was looking for a dash topper the young gentleman behind the counter was helpful enough to offer to order one online for me but was honest enough to say that it would bee less expensive if i order it myself this place is clean and they have everything you can imagine to fix your car looks like a well run place right on the corner of virginia and longley easy access comparable prices great service
2255,i m a big fan of rolled ice cream and this place did not disappoint i had someone pick it up for me so i can t comment on atmosphere but very good i got the s mores flavor
2256,i ve been here on multiple occasions and each time my experience has been a hit or miss i ve had the seafood pan fried noodles which were drowning in watery sauce and the seafood was not that fresh the shrimp are soo small and seems like they are days old i ve had the prawn mee noodle soup again the shrimp seemed old and there was nothing prawnish about the shrimp at all as they were soo small the slices of pork were extremely tough and the broth was very very fishy even the bean sprouts and vegetables seemed old the stir fried rice noodle with salted fish was just ok the fried rice with salted fish was pretty good the roti cani is very good as well i ve also tried the fried intestine and oyster pancake both of which were good the service was always great as the waiter always makes sure to tell us what to expect in the dish so that part i love so all in all i feel like this place can be so much better if only the seafood and veggies were fresh
2257,wow the food this folks make is amazing i m normally not impressed but i m very impressed with the food a chicago paulies been there 3 times and i will keep coming back thank you guys all for another great meal
2258,come at happy hour and get a french 75 and the stuffed oysters you won t regret it the atmosphere here is great and the food is well worth the stop they have great drink specials and delicious oysters this was one of our favorite stops in nola
2259,great place friendly environment the cook is coming up with some great menu ideas bartender is awesome i highly recommend this place for lunch dinner or a place to reconnect with friends
2260,the most pricey market around but for a reason they carry a wide range of everything great store brand products and something for every eating style whole foods also gives local brands a chance to feature in store has hot food w good flavor profiles a cheeses section as big as a walk in closet and on certain days give a ways the store is clean and sports a friendly knowledgeable staff that rarely lets the lines get too long you can grab organic anything and also something for your skin while you re here they really do sell everything you may spend your weight in gold before you leave but you ll be satisfied
2261,always consistantly great for breakfast delicious beignets great eggs try the city grits
2262,this is definitely the best breakfast place in philly f you bored for classic breakfast routine you should definitely come and visit this place for unique taste super fast service delicious coffee and friendly environment highly recommend it for this place for breakfast lunch or brunch it s not like a regular classic american breakfast it s a little expensive but it s worth every penny come on in and enjoy middle eastern hospitality
2263,i ordered a shrimp cauli bowl via uber eats my order came quickly within a reasonable period of time my food was cold i m thinking it s the clear plastic clamshell container used it doesn t keep the heat in not a big deal for me my total without the uber eats surcharge was 19 90 for close to 20 i would expect more than a container with 80 brown rice some diced cauliflower 6 florets if broccoli literally i counted 3 paper thin slices of carrot and 8 measly shrimp it did taste good but it is waaayy overpriced for what you get i will give it another shot on a day when i can actually go in in person but initial reaction is not that sofresh is not soimpressive
2264,totally solid experience giant biscuit w honey and fresh strawberry jam i had the mushroom toast loved it onion jam has a little kick tho my date had the muesli and raaaaaved about it nice fresh fruit side for both of us i m sure it is nearly impossible to get a seat here on weekend mornings
2265,food was good portions were generous a little pricey 29 00 for two people lots of room for improvement in the customer service department
2266,i have to say you get more for what you pay this hotel is clean and organized the staff are very respectful and responsive also breakfast was excellent omg eggs sausage waffles oj you name it
2267,put this review on south street on accident but here is my review i took my big puppy vader to doggie styles on pine st he was a smelly mess but when he was finished with his spa treatment he looked amazing a big shout out to the grooming and staff erin did an amazing job and you could see her true love for animals lily was very helpful and set me up with an account the store was so cute i ll be coming back
2268,i recently returned to zac s and noticed that my one and only complaint from my initial visit had in fact been remedied the first time around the place had been uncomfortably warm well now they ve cranked up the ac and it s perfectly cool and comfortable i appreciate that they listen to and act on customer feedback now i ll def be returning often for the juicy halal burgers
2269,the beds are comfortable the motel is very clean the staff is very friendly the cook really has really done an amazing job he made us to feel very welcome
2270,awesome french toast wonderful service vibe was nice and i love the outside seating i would definitely return
2271,really good ice cream we went through the drive thru think that was a mistake we waited about 35 minutes with 6 cars ahead of us looks like people walking up were getting served quicker but it was excellent everyone enjoyed it was worth the wait the girl who took our order was very pleasant definitely will be back
2272,delicious candy we tried the creamy pralines and tourtes super friendly and helpful staff loved that there was sugar free options and the taste was amazing as well
2273,i would say this is a 4 5 star place we had a bog group so i got to try a few things first the wine is decent and it is nice to have a good red wine a steak the service was good only being open 2 weeks the server was very knowledgeable and friendly i had the striploin and to be honest it wasn t great my sides were amazing though the marrow mash is so good and the brussels sprouts are the same and they come in a huge portion the asparagus also is great but fairly small tongue tacos sounds scary but sooo good split a small order with a friend worth it the skirt steak also very yummy and big portions so the steak is good i just didn t think striploin was super amazing its is so bring some money the ambience is very cool a fun place to go with friends and definitely a new twist on the old steakhouse favorite
2274,never had a bad experience i always get a dirty chia or a lavender latte have yet to be disappointed on my drink when it comes to food i love having so many pastry options i love trying different things their croissants are buttery and delish i always look forward to going here
2275,what do you do when you are extremely hungry locked inside of a venue and there is a food truck you walk up to that food truck and you order the giant hot dog and you inhale it this food truck is new orleans and that s why i needed to give it a try the hot dog was massive and since i m a boring person i got mine plain there s not much to say about a food truck the staff was nice and the food was delicious give it a try
2276,this is the best place in this entire area for breakfast we will come here over and over again service is amazing food is great the portion sizes for your buck are unbeatable keep up the good work cracker barrel we love you
2277,another amazing dining experience by brg hospitality every bite we took was amazing the shrimp crab touffe the jumbo louisiana shrimp en cocotte the gnocchi and the luke burger were all delicious but the show stopper for me was the tuna tar tar the only problem with the tuna tar tar was that i probably could have eaten 4 or 5 of the portions also they use server teams which i usually have mixed experiences with but both of our servers were phenomenal we will definitely be back when we return to nola
2278,homemade ice cream if there is a long line don t let that fool you it moves pretty quick definitely worth the wait be patient if there s a wait it s for a good reason
2279,my friend took me here for my birthday and everything was amazing from the appetizer to the dessert service was excellent the crab bisque was so delicious my steak was made to perfection my dessert was an absolute treat
2280,so i m originally from the bay area ca probably one of the most hipster spots in the country especially with berkeley and oakland just a hop and a skip away from where i grew up knowing that much about me realize that milktooth is quite literally the most hipster restaurant that i ve ever been to in my life from everything to the ghetto af music blasting for brunch the mysteriously facial haired servers and the quite random and ridiculous decor everything just screamed hip and markedly cool so i was in my element the food here is ridiculous their menu is filled with options that you ll read and then go wait wtf those ingredients didn t go together last i checked but then you order it and it s so amazingly good and you re left questioning your own existence like their manchengo and grapfruit dutch baby it s cheese and grapefruit baked into what s essentially a pancake just reading that it s not supposed to taste good but what the heck it s so yummy i don t even get it every flavor bounces off each other so divinely that your tongue is left a little cooked after eating here i d honestly suggest just ordering together as a group and sharing everything that way you can try as many things as possible i personally loved the aesthetic of the restaurant though it was very obviously a auto shop or a gas station or something of that sort previously evidenced by the large garage doors adorning one side of the restaurant our server was very friendly and helpful when it came to the menu so an a on that end and the price was right around what i would have expected from a restaurant like this one in all it was one of the best meals i had on my trip to indy definitely worth a visit
2281,have you ever wished you could buy a nice bottle of wine as in at a wine store and then drink it at a bar here you go buy that nice wine you would have to pay 100 for in a restaurant for 25 and enjoy some excellent jazz music
2282,great place for breakfast the weather was fabulous so the doors were open as well as the balcony i had the avocado omelet with grits and all i can say is amazing we got there about 7 45 and had no problems getting a table but when we left at 8 45 it had started to get busy the lunch menu looked equally delicious
2283,i stayed at jw marriott for a convention recently plus a few additional days in advance the convention center area is big and bright and well organized i appreciated that the elevators were divided into 2 sections for mid rise and high rise floors my room was comfortable and quiet and i had a beautiful view to the west i only wish the day to day operations of the hotel were up to the quality of the convention center itself the swimming pool in this hotel is unusually small the rationale for that is that it s a convention hotel yet they do go out of their way to advertise the pool the staff here are message happy in terms of leaving messages on your phone and if it s a message from the hotel it won t just go away upon playing it in that case you have to call guest services the first message was in regard to me the hotel room was not in my name but i was listed as also in the room the hotel wanted to know how to handle any incidentals i might purchase that to me seemed ridiculous then any day i did not request maid service there was another message notifying me that i didn t get maid service perhaps it was because i had the sign on the door reminding me that i could request it i don t require maid service every day and i went without 3 different days you guessed it 3 different messages one each time and they don t always turn the light off after that the important phrase you have to learn to use is can you please mark the message as delivered it would have been nice if there were a way to turn off the light on the temperature control it s quite bright at night i had to cover it with a towel parking is way too expensive the fee for on site parking was 43 day i then learned that the parking fee for cars for the same garage if you were in some of the other hotels in the complex such as spring hill was less e g 30 day we wound up parking our car offsite at a lot a half mile away for 14 day with free in out privileges and a complimentary plus tips shuttle if you re going to stay here particularly for a convention do a lot of homework in advance because that may save you a bundle of money
2284,today i had an exceptional massage by daryl without question daryl is not only highly skilled as a massuse but he is incredibly intuitive i am fortunate to have had many massages locally and abroad both with independent masseuses and at luxury spa s but today s was the best deep tissue massage i have ever experienced i left feeling relaxed at peace and pain free as well treating myself to three 90 minute package for future use many thanks as i said daryl you have healing hands
2285,super cool vibe we came casual off a long drive excellent service the food was super yummy must try the brussel sprouts they are so sweet and delish we also got the gnocchi and scallops we would definitely recommend this place to visitors and locals
2286,great food and drinks albeit overpriced i had the salt of the earth cocktail and it had great flavor the angry chicken chicken taco was good but one wasn t very filling we had the shiitake lemon and cauliflower pizza as an appetizer and it had good flavor as well
2287,absolutely delicious being puerto rican and coming from a family of chefs i have pretty high standards and pepo s doesn t disappoint the staff is friendly the food delicious and the atmosphere welcoming the aroma hits you on the way in and if you re hungry have the roasted pork it s tender and seasoned perfectly don t pass this gem up
2288,we stayed at the hotel for one week when we went in we were looking for the frig to put some things in it was missing one item and we didn t touch any of the items due to the high price we purchased our own we only had maid service once we wanted to prevent any theft when we were leaving we checked the frig and there were 3 more item missing i was charged 42 90 for drinks and things were didn t use the room was clean but not enough lighting it didn t have a coffee maker in the room but down in the lobby you could get coffee for free the bathroom need towel racks it didn t have any i was disappointed that i was charged because someone came in the room and drank the booze we also only got one wash rag to wash with and hardly any towels i wouldn t stay here again because i was charged for nothing also the tv in the elevator was on all the time annoying
2289,holy hell was this an awesome find lunch special out of this world all u can eat with so many choices for 16 95 i just wanted bulgogi hahah the ban chan were superb and my waitress was super friendly and helpful if u are looking for a great korean bbq look no further btw i was the only white person there at the time if it tells u something my dad always said look to where the asians go
2290,ok br was in route kinda to the airport i was hungry had time and was jonesing for a burger and shake quality stuff again ordered the 69 garlic horseradish aoili on the side with sweet tots and br got the job done again just enough blue cheese taste in every bite the tots were crispy and sweet the strawberry white chocolate shake didn t last long,quality ice cream here there was a line this thursday late but it moved quick lots of tasty sounding choices but i chose the loaded butterscotch and the nutter butter on a chocolate waffle cone no complaints both were outstanding and the butterscotch was definitely the sweeter of the two but i m a huge pb fan so i liked them both equally the only negative would be that the scoops were on the small side
2291,we were back last night for the second time as with the first it was a splendid dinner experience style quality presentation everything sets this restaurant apart it is a welcome addition to the santa barbara food scene i do like the simple unassuming atmosphere finally a restaurant that will change its menu once a month
2292,this is the best place for pizza and wings we give this two thumbs up plenty of tv s to watch the games and a great bar family atmosphere
2293,went on a rainy friday night store was clean everyone was friendly it was a great experience
2294,so i walked in without an appointment for a full set of acrylics they got me in within 30 minutes which is really good vick took care of me these are probably some of the best nails i ve ever had i love them so much will definitely come back
2295,found trips dinner on yelp app wow best breakfast ever all 4 of us agreed take it from me look no further
2296,i ve been to this location three times and i ll say that the food is what keeps bringing me back the restaurant itself has a very modern new american type of feel and very similar to that of the cheesecake factory this location was very busy today on a sunday at lunch time but i believe they do take reservations the food is nothing short of amazing even my dad said it was perfect which is a big nod coming from such a big food critic our waiter was very attentive in the beginning but unfortunately seemed to have a lot of tables to tend to towards the end which made us a wait a bit longer than we would have liked the one thing i would definitely recommend to the restaurant is up front to mention that while meals are being placed is the ideal time to order desert i did see that being noted in the desert section of the menu but realistically most people would not see that until they re finished with their entrees and thus experience very long wait times for dessert it s not ideal i ll definitely come back with these thoughts in mind
2297,fabulous food professional and friendly staff fun music hip ambiance i keep coming back for more
2298,loved this my boyfriend and i did this and rode all down bayshore the neighborhoods riverwalk etc the bikes are easy to use you only pay for time you are pedalling which is great if you want to stop in the park or going to a restaurant you just lock the bike up and it stops your timer we will definitely be doing this again
2299,this place is awesome clean great decor great people alan s the food was perfect harriet our waitress was lovely the staff broke out in song mid meal they all help each other out and seemed to enjoy working there the food came out super fast and the menu has all the normal breakfast fare with several unique options as well we will be back
2300,we had a delayed flight for 4 hours so we decided to eat here their pizza was really good and their lasagna was really good as well the service was kind of slow but then again there was only one waiter and it was packed the space is kind of tight as well we would probably eat here again if we were ever back in the area
2301,good food ok service this stop is a good stop if you can t get into the clear sky
2302,i have been here twice and saw lonisha both times she was very professional and easy going she made me feel really comfortable with my first time ever getting a wax she is now on maternity leave and im going on saturday i am so sad about this because i dont know who else i should go to but this place gets 5 stars because of lonisha
2303,this is a great new addition to the philadelphia restaurant scene the brussels sprouts were perfect we had a delicious special of the day which was this asian tofu dish there is a sommelier on staff and they ve got caught an exhaustive list of wines and other alcohol this is a perfect place for a fancy date or special occasion and it s perfect located in the heart of center city
2304,i loved spending time at cat therapy i mean i got to play with cute cats for an hour so that s enough to make me a satisfied customer but cat therapy was run very well it seemed like the space was organized to keep the cats comfortable the color coded collars made it easy to identify how to approach all of their cats and tere were plenty of spaces for the cats to get privacy the employees knew each cat well and were able to tell you more about any of them since the cats were up for adoption and getting socialized this place seems like everyone wins my only problem is that i didn t know about this place earlier but i m glad i saw their sign on state street i hope they stay for a long time
2305,if you like homemade latin food this is a great place the food is very fresh the sauces are great i like their bowls with yellow spanish rice and fried plantains the staff is also super friendly we try to stop by weekly
2306,excellent brunch the squash fritters with crawfish are amazing best bloody mary in new orleans
2307,this little food stand had such delicious seafood we tried their charbroiled oysters shrimp and grits with jalapeo and boiled shrimp it was sooo cold but the grits were perfectly warming and so satisfying service is great too
2308,always delicious food and great service a the owner is a delight and really cares about his customers and food that is served so glad he opened in land o lakes
2309,awesome place good food nice people rotating specials all home made what else do you want chicken salad is a great pickup to make sandwiches at home
2310,i first emailed through yelp for a basic quote and received a quick response and was also told about the discount from being a yelp user i called and asked if i needed to make an appointment but it was just recommended that i bring my car in early in the morning to ensure it s ready by the end of the day the ladies up front are super communicative and up front about all charges before they went ahead with the work they ordered new parts that arrived the same day as a female in my 20s i m always hesitant to visit new shops when i move to a city but i felt confident in the work they did here
2311,arcadia landscape is a great locally owned company i would recommend this company to family friends and any local business owners their work is high quality and they stand behind their product
2312,great company i called needing my locks changed at my house and they were here in literally 20 minutes i would recommend to anyone thank you for your fast service
2313,what a cool museum lots of hands on engaging displays wide variety of activities from science to art to exploring jobs like boat pilot and being a vet not so big to feel overwhelming relatively healthy food option subway and no gift shop to try and wrangle your munchkins through the museum is clean staff friendly and safety has been thought about in each exhibit this is truly one of the best museums we have seen in a bit and our keepers agreed and had as much fun as us monkeys the verdict if you are in tampa and looking for a great activity check this space out you won t be sorry enjoy the ride baker biker
2314,five stars may seem hyperbolic for a jewish deli but i personally believe that a place deserves five stars when it owns its identity does its thing and does it well i recently ate here for the first time and ordered the corned beef special my litmus test for jewish delis it was massive with thinly sliced corned beef piled 2 3 inches high a generous heap of slaw and rye bread so fresh that the sandwich could hardly be contained my husband and i also split the latkes which were large thick and crispy on the outside everything latkes are supposed to be we actually returned the next day for breakfast and my nova and onion scramble was similarly satisfying and again large i understand that the place has changed locations and possibly management recently so would be diners would do well to ignore the negative reviews of yore and help out a great local business with a positive review to get them the average star rating they deserve
2315,visited due to the yelp reviews the food was good the chicken and waffles were delicious great customer service nice family owned establishment
2316,this is definitely the best local neighborhood joint in the area a few of the reviews seem to show a very different experience between the service at the table and at the bar the bartenders here are in their game the beer list is massive and changes by the season the food is exactly what you want in good bar food black bean crunch salad with chicken and honey dijon vin is out of this world and the vibe is extremely homey and welcoming peak time experiences are the same just about anywhere you go here not sure what the outcry is for if you re having a bad day just go to the bar and ask for kate she ll make sure you re trip to ml is too notch plenty of tv s a nice beer garden our back very reasonable on prices as compared to other places here i live in the neighborhood and come by multiple times a week for a quick drink and haven t once had a subpar experience smile and get to know the guy beside you over a beer and stop bitching it goes a long way
2317,first time in nashville and this was the absolute best find we sat at the pizza bar and our waiter was the amazing the manager gave us a complimentary sausage honey and calabrese pizza that was perfect i would have never thought honey was good on pizza until now i got the tagliatelle bolognese and my friend tried something new and got the agnolotti both our meals were great but the agnolotti was unbelievable 10 10 recommend for the food and the staff
2318,herman was amazing super knowledgeable high energy hilarious and very friendly highly recommend coming in and seeing him we will be back to see him for sure not sure about the other chick but go see herman this place is great with a very large variety of beers and ciders
2319,i stay here for the weekend and boy did i have good time when i tried to take a shower the shower head fell off water when ever where i call the desk someone came and fixed it in 5 minuets fast room service i even won some money on the craps table 5 star all around
2320,great service they were quick friendly and thoroughly explained everything while installing our infant car seat
2321,great place to eat and drink tacos and the curry soup were amazing sabrina is awesome
2322,the only thing i love more than their coffee are the baristas that work here it s a quiet good place to read a book and enjoy a multitude of drinks they offer,this gym has everything you could want but it just feels like something is missing it might just be too pricey for my taste but if you can afford a place like this then it may be for you just feels like money goes into the wrong things when a lot of equipment could be improved the pool is a nice amenity as is the sauna steam room the classes leave much to be desired
2323,amazing hotel in downtown brand new with very friendly staff great location and amenities
2324,never fails this place is awesome my personal faves tend to be the biscuit and the savory dutch baby regardless of toppings
2325,service and food was exceptional you have to try the bbq shrimp it is to die for they will give you a warm towel and a lemon wedge afterwards knowing you ll be getting your hands dirty
2326,just ordered a veggie pizza and cinnamon sticks for carry out the pizza toppings and cheese were really fresh the cinnamon sticks were awesome our order was ready in 15 min i will never eat papa john s again thank you dominos
2327,i recently took my father to the love to celebrate his birthday and father s day when i made my reservation i made a note of those celebrations and upon being greeted by the hostess that was the first thing they addressed with my sweet papa the ambience is really hip and it s a fairly intimate setting we were seated in their booth style cushioned seats which was very comfortable i am a booth girl all the way i ordered he shrimp and grits with baby buttermilk biscuits and my dad ordered the catfish and hush puppies in his true southern style can we talk about those biscuits so delicious words cannot express why i ate 5 of them in one sitting the shrimp and grits were great and that s coming from someone who never eats grits my dad was less impressed with the catfish and hush puppies but that s coming from someone who was born and raised in the south i tried the hush puppies as well and they paled in comparison to the biscuits our server was very sweet and fairly attentive given the packed restaurant for the total experience i would return if i want truly amazing southern food despite their menu i would go elsewhere
2328,overall very pleased with the service i got from music city optical i was able to book an appointment without difficulty and ended up lasting a little under an hour even as a new patient my prescriptions were quickly updated and i was sent away with a few trial contacts staff is friendly they helped me navigate what my insurance covers or doesn t finding the parking lot was a little tricky as there are many one way streets
2329,i went with a friend for a casual dinner it was pretty packed with the only seating left was at the bar on this evening a band was playing memorable songs from years gone by i had the fish and chips which came with a side of coleslaw i really tried to like this dish but nothing was seasoned the coleslaw was finely shredded and sort of maybe had a dressing on it what would it cost to put a little something on it the fish was fried in a thick crust without any seasoning thick cut fries which i tried to put salt on but each of the salt shakers the holes were clogged price 12 99 my girlfriend had the bangers n mash what a flavorful dish 4 sauges over mashed potatoes with a gravy what a flavorful dish the sausages were delish every item on that plate had a flavor which made the eating so much better i would have to say it is a plate of comfort food i believed she paid 15 99 for the dish the mash potatoes were so creamy which made the flavorful gravy even a better moment in time i would try a lunchtime to be able to see more of the decor also make a different selection of food the service was wonderful and attentive
2330,really great paella beet hummus and so much more very relaxed atmosphere and great service
2331,i really dislike leaving negative reviews and i normally have a pleasant experience here but today my coworkers and i ordered delivery and one order was wrong and one order didn t come with the sauce when i called to let them know they didn t apologize and sounded inconvenienced when i asked them to fix it they weren t pleasant or apologetic now i get that mistakes happen but just apologize it s a simple thing but goes a long way i m going to hold off on coming here for awhile
2332,i usually really like 8th union good food decent prices cute atmosphere unfortunately today we had a party for brunch and i was honestly embarrassed i recommended it the weightier had to take our order several times because he forgot what we said then when our food came several things were missing i e it said it came with bacon but no one got bacon any add ons people made were missing etc i believe every one of us had some kind of problem with the order party of 10 i m hoping it was just a bad day or a new person because i was really disappointed i will definitely give them a second chance hopefully have a better experience otherwise i don t see myself returning that said i ve had dinner there before been happy great happy hour deals so again hoping it s just a fluke
2333,after i tasted ted drewes i can t eat another ice cream i love ted drewes best ice cream ever in my life
2334,two thumbs up great place for young kids food was good and beer was cold coming back next year
2335,i know everyone raves about this place but the chicken biscuit was pretty gross the chicken was undercooked and slimy and i couldn t finish it i would not go back
2336,great food and friendly staff only space for the improvement us the service from order to serve
2337,favorite place to get thai in south tampa cant go wrong with their pineapple curry or phad thai they also have great soups everything always tastes great and fresh they are also quick at getting your order ready for pickup
2338,we were so looking forward to having breakfast here after seeing the commercial on tv and being told about it by others unfortunately our eggs we over cooked and had to be sent back after waiting for over an hour for an order of eggs it really ruined our experience i will give the management staff credit they did apologize and removed the order from our check will probably give this place another try the staff really hustles out front
2339,first of all the service was awesome second of all wowwwwwwwwww the food was ahh mazzzzzzzzing and i ll def be a repeat customer here i m so excited about this vegan restaurant my favorite vegan spot hands down not to mention no tofu or soy products i had the stuffed pepper mac n cheese greens and cauliflower and omg was it delicious and i m a harsh food critic too btw giving credit where credit is due braaaaaaavo
2340,after having several issues related to sciatic nerve pain dr welch has really helped me alleviate the pain and put me on a program to strengthen my core muscles to avoid future problems very professional and i would highly recommend this office for your chiropractic needs
2341,i ve been here twice and the service is always exceptional all of the beers are delicious and you ve got to try their kolsche however the food is really hit or miss i went with the daily chicken sandwich special and it was not good i let the waiter know that i didn t want my food and they took it back insisted on getting me something else to eat i politely declined and just asked for another beer and they comped it i will always come back to the bottleworks when i m in town they have really fun events and their beer is extraordinary my food was great on my first visit
2342,delicious steaks for a good price service is always spectacular tonight shanele was our server she did a great job of checking on us frequently and always with a smile the reason five stars were not given is because it can get too noisy inside especially when patrons celebrating an event are serenaded by the staff
2343,i love coming to this show the first time i went to it when it was much smaller at the enjoy centre but sometimes less is more there are so many awesome vendors here but being a self professed foodie my favourites were the food vendors oh and soo many samples i ended up with a bag of dumplings bottle of infused vodka 6 bottles of wine 2 meat pies we had these for dinner so yummy a bag of dehydrated mushrooms a bag of cookies and i almost came home with a bag of kick ass caramels but as you can see i was over my budget limit i have to give some shout outs to the awesome alberta vendors i bought from spirit hills winery black diamond distillery untamed feast south island pie company you guys rock
2344,amazing steaks we always share the steak they re huge love the sauted mushrooms
2345,hands down the best chorizo and carne asada tacos in town occasionally the chef makes mole sauce and if available then you re in for a real treat by far taqueria azteca is the most authentic mexican food in nashville provecho
2346,good laid back brunch spot more casual than garces more famous spots amada tinto but still with nice unique touches menus on wooden slabs artsy plates creative cocktails the neighborhood is quiet on the weekends during the day so it s never terribly busy for brunch and there s cheap parking in a lot right next to the building which also houses garces corporate headquarters i always get a kick of the large painting in the lobby done in a traditional spanish style of a cat sitting atop a horse as far as the food can t go wrong with any of the waffle plates this most recent time my wife had the fresh berries and i had the fried chicken the waffles are cooked perfectly and not too dense heavy great syrup and home made butter service is very friendly there s a huge bar too so i imagine this would be a great spot to grab a drink or fancy pizza after work during the week
2347,this place is an amazing place to visit from the atmosphere to the quality of the service to the food itself cake bake is getting a full 5 star review this quaint restaurant is decorated with all kinds of flowers there are flowers decorating the patio flowers in wreaths hanging on the inside there is even a fake tree where the host stand is located there is gorgeous dcor in the restaurant from the tables and chairs where their guests sit to the marble countertops to the restroom the owner does a wonderful job of creating an elegant getaway for people all over the first thing i noticed was all the beautiful and delicious treats that were on display there were three layer cakes cookies macaroons pies and even a three layer cake with cookies on top a smiling face seated my friend and me immediately she was very sweet and even gave us recommendations on what to order because this was my first time here i ordered a rose cappuccino and a piece of the raspberry champagne cake we only waited five minutes before our server brought out our drinks and then maybe other ten or so minutes until she brought our cake to us the presentation of the cake and the cappuccinos was exquisite the cappuccino was delicious and foamy with sprinkled mini rose petals on top the cake was delicious as well with three layers of white cake and layers of a raspberry covered in a delicious light vanilla frosting garnished with a raspberry overall this restaurant is a must for anyone who is looking for a unique place for brunch coffee or even just an afternoon snack
2348,jen did an absolutely beautiful job with the flowers for our wedding at saddlerock ranch in malibu we requested a boho tropical theme and she delivered perfectly with a blend of orchids birds of paradise pin cushion protea roses etc with a mix of beautiful greenery her creations are gorgeous she has a talent for taking your ideas to the next level she couldn t be a sweeter person to work with and her pricing is more than fair i cannot recommend her enough
2349,ate lunch with a group of ladies at puckett s first time to eat here i had the brisket salad so delicious i will definitely be back
2350,i live in carp and this place is my go to 9 10 times i want to eat out i probably go here a solid 4 5 times a month would be more if my friends boyfriend wouldn t get mad that i always choose thai i m happy this place exists love their tom kah soup panang curry pumpking curry pad thai and pineapple fried rice
2351,the food was amazing and manuel was even better great service great food will definitely be back thank you
2352,this place has fabulous mexican seafood their prices are comparable to red lobster their oysters are super fresh and i love their cocktails and shrimp and fish platters they re fish platters come with fries and generous portions of rice and salad you won t be disappointed this is the best location for this chain in tucson it is also super clean even though the decor is a bit cheesy their staff is super nice and bilingual
2353,this was always a favorite place to go have a tasty rapini pizza and glass or two of nice red wine the staff has always been professional and fun it was doubly great to go tonite as they recently re opened after the awful fire up the block the place has been totally cleaned and was its warm cozy self the crew was cheerful the food and wine great as usual and salted caramel and bourbon butterscotch gelato was superb be sure to come back and support this special neighborhood business
2354,from service to taste this restaurant had it all their mahi sandwich was cooked and seasoned perfectly their drink selection was vast and test
2355,i am from colorado and am visiting santa barbara and let me tell you what a great place to eat the food was quality but the customer service was even better also i thought the price was really good for the amount of food you get food came out fast as well overall i d say it s a great breakfast place if you are in santa barbara
2356,this dollar tree puts all other dollar trees to shame i am a bargain hunter so i ve been to a lot of them this one is super clean well organized and has a huge variety of products they even have maps of the store by the entrance and by the cashiers definitely worth going to if you re looking for a bargain buy
2357,impressed great flavor crab legs not over cooked had shrimp king crab and snow crab we will be back again we had the garlic mild seasoning and it had a nice bite to it
2358,i was pleasantly surprised by this place i liked all there flavors they have the girls that worked there were very pleasant and very friendly even though the service was super slow the only reason i gave it a four star is because the tables were filthy and were not wiped down after customers were done and the service was slow too but besides that it was good
2359,after spending one of our vacation days visiting indian rocks beach and clearwater beach we headed back to have dinner and find an ice cream spot in the indian rocks beach area we looked on yelp for nearby pizza places and tj s pulled up with good reviews the outside looks like your typical very casual beach area dining establishment we were in casual shorts and tops and figured we were dressed for dining here we were surprised upon walking in to see the interior set like a fine italian eatery we were promptly seated and a super friendly waitress brought us menus and told us of specials that had ended minutes before we arrived we ordered a 16 inch four cheese pizza on homemade crust and my husband ordered a pizza with several ingredients while waiting on our order the waitress brought out bread and oil and a cold jar of fresh from italy it was so good we all drew beach scenes on the white paper tablecloth while waiting and our waitress took a cute family photo for us the pizzas were top notch service super friendly and the pastas we saw going to nearby tables looked delicious so glad we stopped here to dine give tj s a try
2360,chris is the best he goes above and beyond for his customers he treats both his customers and his employees with respect he s very good at problem solving and keeping long term costumers
2361,the shop is cute and everything is displayed beautifully there is no lot nearby so parking may be weird but it s worth having to walk a few blocks in my opinion the items were all gorgeous no sloppy frosting or whatever else here you can tell the bakers really care about their work i found the prices a tad high to be honest but having gone through most of my haul the quality is top notch and is definitely worth the splurge every now and again between me and my parents were got a little of everything and i really recommend the red velvet cake the best cake i ve ever had seriously and the various bars key lime and lemon are not to be missed my major complaint was nothing had prices on it so you had to ask constantly and when i went it was very busy so that quickly became a hassle also the women at the counter seemed to be a bit overwhelmed by the crowd so things didn t run as smoothly as they should have it was early afternoon on a weekday still busy but i m sure saturday or sunday mornings are worse maybe management should look into getting some extra help i did want to shout out to the women at the counter though someone came in to pick up a special order cake for the kentucky derby of all things and there was some very minor issue with it that the woman was very upset over unneeded in my opinion the issue had no effect on her ability to enjoy the cake it was purely aesthetic and truly a small detail and the woman helping her was very kind and understanding and considerate when dealing with this drama queen
2362,finally got around to this place after a busy saturday came in and we were seated within 10 minutes which came to a surprise because the place was packed sat down and looked over the menu and decided that i could not possibly pass up the queso and guac dip this was definitely a good choice since the guac was super fresh and the queso was cheesetacular my only regret was getting the riesling instead of a beer for this meal my main dish was hard to choose because they had so much to pick from though was finally able to decide on the short rib grilled cheese the sandwich itself was okay though once i found out they have given what seemed to be a horseradish aioli the dish went from a mediocre sandwich to a richly complex flavored dish that i could not stop eating in the end the meal was a solid one and my only pique would be that even though we were seated fairly quickly the service was a bit slow it was a very crowded saturday so i cannot complain overly much to sum up as one other reviewer said this place is like the cheesecake factory without the wait and that is far from a bad thing
2363,one of my new favorite coffee shops an unexpected gem with winning ambiance stellar coffee and prices that can t be beat a friend recommended pia and once i found it i was not disappointed i will be going back
2364,i very rarely eat fast food but when i need that fix chick fil a is it i just had their chicken biscuit and was very happy the chick fil a standard for being clean prompt tasty and courteous is well met here the staff is doing an awesome job and i really appreciate it because it is so far the opposite of what i find at many other places
2365,one of my favorite spots to eat in this city the food is on point all the time and everything on the menu is divine you can t go wrong close your eyes and point it will be delicious the drink menu is everything i could dream of and the cocktails intentionally pair well with the food menu i like sitting inside but on a nice day you can people watch from the sidewalk tables or bring your dog love love love horn s
2366,so good hearty sized donuts with unique variations not open very late but perfect for a morning bite after a late night
2367,everyone here is always super friendly especially in the shoe department every year or two i walk in looking vaguely for shoes and they always take the time to help me figure out what exactly i want and find it in an uncommon size 10 5 additionally the encore plus size section has gotten bigger nicer and trendier which is always appreciated i ve been to other locations and haven t always had good luck with the shoe department or the encore section the cafe is also a tasty place to grab some food for a shopping break my only complaint is that they don t seem to have the piano player anymore or at least they haven t been playing the past several times i ve been at nordstrom the piano player was one of my favorite things coming here when i was younger
2368,ok the bbq shrimp here is the best i ve ever had our bartender was phenomenal and truly made the whole experience for us he gave us bibs and we ate with the bbq shrimp with our hands there really is no other better way to eat them they are finger lickin good i can t wait to come back here and try more of their menu items
2369,fun little place the bartender and regulars are a blast drinks ice cold will definitely be back
2370,this place is at the very end of stearns wharf its not very big and it takes awhile to get a table however the guys that work there are very efficient and take good care once you re seated clam chowder pretty good lobster roll again pretty good dungeness crab also good overall its a good seafood restaurant with nice pacific ocean views
2371,my pizza was delicious and quickly delivered only reason i give 4 stars is because i asked for them to write a joke on the box and they didn t
2372,great food and great music overall an excellent addition to the area came in around 830 on a saturday night and the place was very full i had one of the colossal crab cakes which was delicious little to no filler lots of delicious lump crab meat and flavorful seasoning the fries were delicious too great sweet savory seasoning only reason for 4 5 stars is the service i think they may have been understaffed because we had to wait at least 15 minutes for a waiter and another 20 before getting our oysters but all in all a great time
2373,easy in and out tellers are great generally don t have a problem with them talking endlessly to customers while there is a line but sometimes the customer is not prepared or they want attention and they try to stand there and chat even when there are people waiting to do business lori is great and i enjoy doing business with her she has been excellent in helping me close my mothers estate account she gets more than five stars but be aware that most things other than taking money our or putting money in the bank require an appointment many times i have walked in thinking it was something simple just to find out i need and appointment and appointments get double booked
2374,nashville hot chicken on a biscuit the chicken was amazing and the staff was outstanding a sample of their chronic bacon put our breakfast over the edge our host tyler took a great breakfast and made it amazing with his recommendations and overall great attitude they are definitely here to get your day started off on the right foot i can t say enough nice things about the staff don t miss this gem
2375,came home from a trip overseas and girlfriend announces she found a banh mi shop in wilmington skeptical at first i agreed to check it out i was quite surprised by their menu being written in vietnamese which gives me an authentic vibe i glanced at the staff and asked them something in vietnamese and she replied which was rather assuring i ve had past experiences where you enter an establishment which claims they are vietnamese and turned out to be chinese and that s another story onto the food we ordered an original and a grill chicken banh mi very authentic and large in size which made it a very good deal very tasty and stuffed with meats and veggies overall it is my new place for banh mi and saves me the trip up to washington ave in philadelphia for genuine vietnamese banh mi
2376,really great food love that it was a great spot for a family to eat breakfast banana pancakes and boudin omelet we re really good
2377,the food and service at red mesa in one word dope the bartender was nice they serve you chips and salsa and i m not talking a little b h basket either you get a large portion i had the seafood ceviche to start this dish was filled with delicious clams red onions scallops shrimp avocado was incredible didn t need to add extra salt or lime for my entree i had the duck enchiladas check out this description roasted duck red onions peppers topped with raspberry chipotle cream sauce and queso fresco braised field greens rice and pineapple salsa if you re not salivating right now have someone pinch you or check your pulse you might not be alive
2378,lovely shop very nice service they ordered me some white hyacinth from their supplier when i mentioned i couldn t find white this season the bulbs were best so far
2379,this cute little eatery was suggested to neighbors on nextdoor old northwest the menu isn t huge but offers some interesting options i had the mistress grilled cheese three different kinds of cheeses with balsamic brussels sprouts and tomato on a delicious bread the staff was friendly and the owner checked on us to see how everything was and said this was their third day open we ll be back
2380,we were here on a saturday early so it was not crowded seems like a nice place with a food court with some neat choices sandcastles in the center pretty nice
2381,the food was a great introduction to the city not overly seasoned and could have been a little spicier but the food was good
2382,service here is above the normal restaurants the whole staff is friendly and helpful to all their customers the korean bibimbap on a skillet tastes great and the tacos ate tasty
2383,this store moved to my boyfriend and is neighborhood and we couldn t be more happy it has such a cute selection of quality dog products not overstocked or overwhelming but enough selection to keep even the pickiest dog owners coming back for new things the owner is so nice also i make up excuses to come in every few days and just look around because it s so cute inside highly recommend my dog does too
2384,great little sushi place first one in this area and people love it pretty good prices a couple menu items are a bit overpriced in my opinion but overall definitely still worth it
2385,in a world where everything is processed full of fat sugar sodium and cholesterol this is a breath of fresh air especially for a person who s body does not tolerate any of the aforementioned it s so hard for me to find a place to eat out greenplate prepares their food fresh per order the staff were very nice and eager to explain or offer suggestions greenplate is absolutely somewhere i will frequent
2386,let me just give you the tl dr best sandwich shop in all of stl buffalo sandwich is what i ended up getting here great portion saucy meat without the food being too dried great balance of sandwich meat and veggies i came near the end of their lunch hour and got to speak with the owner just for a bit before they closed up that really set the mood for me as we bonded over our love for great music and our travel between orange county la and st louis only urk was the amount of flies by the window not sure how and where it came from but that didn t bother me as much because that sandwich is just that good,every time i stop by an italian restaurant i forget they re there to feed the starving family in you my gosh my meal was never ending alfredo sauce was pretty good standard to what i expect my white sauce to be rich and creamy i also ordered a side of the meatball because it seems to be their specialty cooked through without being too tough the meat tasted well seasoned without overpowering and despite the clashing sauce was pretty good to eat together blasphemous maybe but i enjoyed it i will stop by for a meal next time i m in stl
2387,like buena onda but less chain y illegal tacos serves up flavorful soft tacos at a reasonable price the shrimp are nicely seasoned and grilled to order the toppings are always fresh right down to the fragrant cilantro leaves definitely try a few of the salsas my favorites are the citrusy spicy hot version and the smoky sweet medium salsa but they are all unique and add different flavor nuances when combined with the tacos and fillings
2388,the best enough said quality food and service highly recommend by far worth the trip to tarpon springs
2389,excellent food friendly staff it gets crowded during weekday lunch hours but they also do take out and pickup orders
2390,i ve been coming here once or twice a month for somewhere between 10 and 20 years and it hasn t changed too much the pupusas are still delicious as is everything else i ve tried on the menu i mostly order pupusas and the huevos rancheros but you can t go wrong with any of the dishes at this place
2391,this was my first ethopian food experience although i have nothing to compare it to i will say it was a wonderful introduction the host and servers were very welcoming and explained the history of ethopian food the restaurant itself and our choosen entrees in detail the dishes themselves were fresh and flavorful as well i look forward to trying more ethopian and other african cuisine in the future
2392,dosa hut was recommended to us and after visiting we d recommend it to anyone too some of the best indian food we ve had in the us the best bhindi masala outside india the dosas took me right back to many trips to chennai the textures flavors and aromas looking forward to going back to try more of the menu in a dining room of multiple indian families also out for dinner a good indicator of its quality
2393,the food was good but i m giving this one less star because if you re not into breakfast there really aren t a lot of interesting lunch items and after waiting a good thirty plus minutes for a table and nearing 1 pm the lunch type item you wanted may be gone so if you re not really in the mood for pancakes or eggs this may not be the place for you that being said if you re into breakfast the pancakes are creatively good i had the pecan pancakes which were delightfully flavorful
2394,might be my new favorite taco joint the only b caribe is the parking but it s downtown who the heck am i to complain is there ever parking downtown no so just ignore that comment and eat some tacos
2395,just bought a washer and dryer from the outlet andrew was very knowledgeable and helpful through the entire process he served is wish a polite attitude and answered all our questions
2396,the restaurants are amazing the staff is very friendly and helpful spa hostesses inside the spa need some work and the rooms in the toscana tower are i think one of the best i ve ever stayed in the hotel is very clean edge nightclub is phenomenal the hotel definitely delivers
2397,the happy hour deals here are the best my favorite thing at copa is definitely the 5 lime margs if you go between 4 7pm their cheap food options are mediocre choices but the best thing on their menu is spanish fries with real cheddar so delicious 10 10 would recommend the reason i gave 3 5 stars because their service tends to be really slow which sucks even though everyone is really friendly and a lot of their other food options are expensive and mediocre would still recommend spanish fries tho
2398,love this place such good food their chicken salad is next level it s definitely a hippie vibe kinda place so it may not be everyone s cup of tea in nashville but that doesn t change how good the food is
2399,fantastic service above average food outstanding whisky selection and the best old fashions i ve had in philadelphia
2400,1 hella uncomfortable seats equivalent of plastic stools 2 no outlets 3 wi fi slow af 4 cuties
2401,love this place great amenities and enjoyed valet parking some rooms are small but i will request a larger room next time book through peppermill directly not through hotels com
2402,i ve been twice and it s been a great experience each time fresh unique atmosphere the guy at the counter was also really excited about the menu which is always a good sign and had helpful suggestions for what to try
2403,the wings were good the loaded baked potato fries weren t the fries were soft and the bacon was bland i will go back for the wings but next time i ll try the tots
2404,wings are great and we ve always had great service must stop for a quick bite on bourbon
2405,one of the best sandwich shops i ve been to in awhile it s authentic cuban food and the owner put a smile on our faces today i highly recommend this place you will not leave hungry
2406,food and service was very good we sat outside on deck we got a beer flight pork and gouda turnover and pork nachos everything was excellent they have 4 sauces we liked the sweet sauce on the turnover and the house on the nachos
2407,happy hour here is great we ordered the corn rangoons which were a nice combination of savory and sweet and the bulgogi dumplings along with the happy hour cocktail special if we had stopped there the bill would have been 24 but the dumplings were so good we had to get another order and the cocktails were so good we had to each get ahem two more and the food in general was so delicious that we wanted to try some entrees the brisket ramen noodles were perfectly cooked and the meat was very tender the shrimp dan dan noodles were peanutty and creamy service was very attentive and friendly and even with all the booze the bill was more than reasonable can t wait to come back
2408,we had a lovely lunch and 6 of us shared the taste of soul platter we were not disappointed i wish we have substituted the greens for something else but that s ok we got fried okra also our waitress was antoinette and she was a delight
2409,i eat sushi constantly and i wanted to try a new place this place was reasonably priced and very fresh the best part was now quick the service was everyone was super friendly and the rolls were large and in charge started out with the app of gyoza was delicious very juicy the asahi special roll was amazing it s deep fried and huge the rainbow roll was topped with fresh salmon and tuna and white fish the spicy crunchy salmon was good the only thing was the rock n roll with the shrimp tempura i feel was missing more of the actual shrimp filling other than that i will be going back for sure
2410,my coworker and i came here the other day after work for spur of the moment pedicures when we arrived the spa was busy and all of the ladies were with customers after we picked out our polish they set up the pedicure stations so we could wait while our feet were soaking we probably waited for 20 min or so but it was great because our feet were soaking the women working did not rush through the other customer s manis and pedis to get to us we felt very well taken care of and relaxed our pedicures were great we both had the standard pedi which comes with a 10 min leg massage and hot stones for only 25 i will definitely be back here and continue recommending them
2411,aldi is small so it s easy and quick to get in and out if you only need a few things they have many organic items the vegetables are ok but i found the fruit to be low quality and not tasty the chocolate bars and crackers are good they have really good brie cheese that s very reasonably priced they don t not have shopping bags so bring your own you will also need a quarter so you can get a cart which you get back when you return the cart parking is convenient in the lot right there in this shoppng center there s also a dunkin donuts
2412,love the services at wink i drive 2 hrs to have my lashes done because they are the best damone did my brows ahhh mazing and amy does my lashes they always work around my schedule and are fun yet professional it makes a huge difference and worth the drive for quality services
2413,we went in a rain storm and were able to be seated right away on a saturday evening that was lucky because on the way out as the rain slowed there was a long line the food is upscale southwestern and i had a fish entree and my date a steak on skewers over yucca fries both were excellent and the waiter was great attentive without being intrusive they ve been there about 30 years and still going strong in the past i ve taken out of town people there who liked the unique menu years ago they were written up in new york times in a 36 hours in st petersburg no need to dress fancy as it s very casual best to try on a week night
2414,this may be my new favorite pizza place in tucson the food was amazing the figo and picante pizzas are top notch you can tell that everyone working there is passionate about food and it shows in the quality of their dishes places like this are the reason i don t eat at chains and support local
2415,i m a frequent traveler and where i m from their are no zaxbys so when i know theirs zaxbys locations wherei m staying i m there this one didn t disappoint the cashier was friendly and the portions were outstanding i always get a cobb grilled salad so i can t speak about any other menu item theirs plenty of parking my only negative is the area isn t great but isn t bad either the 5 stars are for the portions which aren t always consistent at many locations parking is a breeze so i recommend this location
2416,food is very average chinese food general tso chicken was ok over all typical chinese take out
2417,rigatoni was delicious meatloaf made me remember childhood dinners beautiful setting and decor a classy atmosphere we will be back
2418,yummy good tasty custard service was friendly fast and price was reasonable definitely recommend the experience you won t go wrong will definitely go back if in the area,overall experience was good well organized and on time the experience was very informative nice and relaxing food was good and fresh server was nice and attentive photos of nola from the boat in the evening sunset are very nice would recommend
2419,sister restaurant to cantina feliz same menu service was average but very pleasant the environment was lacking music bounced between rock and mexican themes which was odd but the food was solid

2421,recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and craving pizza eclipse pizza to the rescue with their delicious cauliflower crust pizza so delicious and absolutely satisfied my craving my husband had a calzone and commented on how fresh the ingredients were totally worth the trip from north valleys
2422,best sports bar with amazingly good food ice cold beer and huge beer selection i d come weekly for dinner and the get my la batt blue draft beer
2423,this is good food no questions about it i didn t get a chance to try the bbq which makes me a little sad but the chicken dish i had was dope the sauces were good the sides were good and i ve heard great things about it def gonna have to come back and sample all the other goodies from the menu
2424,i can not say enough great things about this place we sat at the bar and met the owner who was very friendly and wine knowledgeable the food was delish with generous portions the beer cheese is an absolute must we will definitely be back
2425,awesome time with my first time to nola captain jules did a hell of a job showing all of us and good time and super knowledgeable i would recommend this company to anyone looking for something way out of the ordinary to do
2426,what a surprise gluten free options drove me to try this place out for myself and it was well worth a short drive burger was delicious fresh and cooked to perfection with a tasty gluten free bun that made a great main course to the hand cut fries so plentiful too definitely plan to try this place out again
2427,great service i needed my wedding dress bustled the four days before my wedding and they were able to get me in and fixed she was also able to put on belt last minute very thankful for the kind service they are attached to bridal prom shop so they have lots of additional accessories
2428,milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch at first glance of the menu you may think you ve never heard of any of these foods for breakfast and you may be right i guarantee no matter what you order you re going to enjoy it milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in indy which means you will typically have a wait trust me it s worth the usual 30 minute wait on weekends to make it go by a little faster they ve got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you re about to have their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients i love all of their variations on a dutch pancake and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for if you re making this a boozy breakfast don t pass up on the michelada and sit outside if it s warm enough
2429,i m only giving 3 stars cuz of the drinks top shelf margaritas were mediocre i drink lots of margaritas ok if ya gonna do mexican ya need a great margarita and the waiter did not know anything the bar staff seamed lost i got the red fish fajitas it was delicious the wife got a stake taco it was stuffed with meat and also delicious for me it s i ate there once and won t go back
2430,loved this place super busy for the most about a 20 minute wait but totally worth it i will say the waiters were very nazi about getting our plates out had 4 come up in a 30 minute period asking if they could take our food that we very obviously weren t done with but that d be the only negative thing about the place the ramen is amazing and loved the amount of options on sake
2431,ricky was amazingly helpful i d locked myself out and had to walk around the corner to call carpinteria lock and key and he arrived and had my door unlocked before i returned amazing fast service with a smile thanks so much for solving my embarrassing slip up before my face even had a chance to get red
2432,omg this hertz location inside harrahs was extremely convenient and the young woman daesha was very professional and caring she apologized that we were getting a suv instead of a full size car and walked with us to it to make sure it was ok for us to drive we had never driven an suv before she gave us her email and phone to call if we had any problem because the desk is not manned on sunday the service couldn t have been better we got a gmc suv that had only 5400 miles on it and ran perfectly great service and as usual hertz is the only place we rent from
2433,i just wanted to thank you for making two elderly women very happy today my husband and i are aruba marriott timeshare owners and long time platinum members we have been to your hotel multiple times however my 83 year old mother never was when she mentioned her and her 84 year old girl friend were going to drive to nashville from cincinnati for a visit i strongly recommended they stay here they love to drink wine and see things and this would enable them to park the car have everything they needed and walk home after a few drinks it wasn t in their budget as they both live on limited fixed incomes but after much convincing they agreed since it would probably be their first and last visit since they are getting older when they arrived today your gracious front desk staff upgraded them to a balcony room since the holiday travelers have all gone home i can t thank you enough for making a great trip better for them as soon as they got to their room i received a text with the news we are forever marriott fans
2434,i would definitely come back to this restaurant the entire menu had markings on it to show which items were gluten free vegan and lactose free the food was delicious and they even had a gluten free flatbread which was fluffy and tasted like real bread we ordered one flatbread to start but then ended up buying two more because they were so good we ordered several other dishes all of which came out fast and packaged in plastics containers so that it was simple to pack up to take home the restaurant had an a la carte menu as well as a buffet so there were many options to choose from i would definitely recommend it to anyone who has dietary restrictions as well as those without
2435,so happy i found a bomb local sushi place always ignored this shop going to domino s but i m so glad i popped in will be coming here more than i should from now on i got this sushiya roll and i was more than pleased the salmon tasted fresh and the miso was on point 10 10 recommend this spot
2436,this is 100 my favorite breakfast bagel place in downtown dunedin and probably even the whole tampa bay area their bagels have been voted best in the tampa bay area for like 4 years in a row or something and boy do they live up to that reputation the lady who owns it is extremely nice and friendly the service there is wonderful and the food is delicious
2437,food was amazing and the service was very accommodating although they quoted us a wait time of 30 min it ended up being about an hour the staff was very accommodating and apologized numerous times we did go about an hour before close and they still accommodated us price is pretty reasonable for sea food and i did enjoy everything i had to eat pros food service cons food turn around time is slow wait time no free refills for drinks will i be back yes but i would make a reservation
2438,we stayed at the avalon for 2 days after a cruise everyone and everything was wonderful we had sandwich s day one with the happy hour daquri delicious dessert was awesome great service next day breakfast pulled out all the stops later poolside with 3 00 craft beer the pool and surrounding area are beautiful well appointed each and every staff member was friendly out going suggestions on area museums and attractions we will be back avalon and hollander better than our cruise
2439,came here 7 2 6pm got seated got drinks got served got dinner all good no problems as with other reviews good meal good service good time good night and good bye,nice quaint place ample parking busy don t be in a hurry simple menu for b fast coffee so so typical menu nothing really stood out however if the waitress asks you if you want fried onions on your home fries be aware it s an additional charge pumpernickel toast nice
2440,arrived at around 9 20 and a lot of their toppings were empty although they weren t ones that i wanted for myself it may be a problem for others their flavors were pretty good the dole pineapple and honey greek were probably my two favorites also grateful that they had my favorite mochi bits pretty decent frozen yogurt spot but don t expect to be blown out of the water or anything though
2441,we have had three meals since opening day proud to admit that this has now become my favorite sushi spot the drinks are phenomenal sushi is fresh and creative and i love the vibe in there ps to one of the previous comments they have high chairs kids have lives too
2442,clean friendly and the food is great service is always great they ask how spicy you want your selection and it always comes as you asked i always start with the samosas
2443,i can t say enough about the excellent service i received at this establishment i worked with desmond and he made the entire experience painless i mean who likes shopping for a mattress from narrowing down which mattress was best for me to working with my crazy schedule on the delivery he made it all work the purchase price was reasonable and the mattress is very comfy i highly recommend this business
2444,today we saw our little baby boy we are extremely happy we got amazing service so friendly attitude the lady was attentive took time to make pics of baby face we are fully satisfied and will come back in 10 weeks thank you
2445,we go here more than i d like to admit the food is consistently delicious they have a great beer selection and the staff is super friendly the last time we went my calzone lost the bottom crust while it was being made they brought that one out told us what happened and said that they already had a new one in the oven and would box it up for us if we wanted a free calzone any other place either wouldn t have told me that the bottom was missing or would have reluctantly asked if we wanted another one made instead of taking the initiative to make the situation right fantastic customer service
2446,one of the top tier spa s in reno when i stayed at other suites in the area they were trash compared to this gem the tuscany rooms cannot be beat courteous staff and no 2 hrs waiting in line to check in
2447,great local pizza joint affordable price quick turn around for pick up delivery time is pretty average everyone i have dealt with is courteous we ve been eating here for decades
2448,beautiful waterfront park with lots to do they have a mini splash park docks playground picnic tables a bait shop and a small restaurant if you re in the area definitely check this park out and you won t be disappointed
2449,walked in for eyebrow threading and this was my first time experience samira was awesome she had very good customer service and made me feel comfortable since i didn t know what to expect i love my eyebrows now they are super clean and it was a quick process thank you samira
2450,eat upstairs for a great view not the best but not the worst food i would probably go again,absolutely love this place i ve ate inside outside and had a special birthday party hosted here it s an incredible atmosphere that i always enjoy especially when i have out of town guests if you re a sweets person this is the place
2451,i don t know how long i ve been saying that if the world was ending or if i was dying the first thing i d do is rush to vetri thankfully neither scenario happened and i was privileged to finally dine there last night with that being said i obviously preemptively put vetri cucina on a pedestal surrounded with unrealistic hype i had butterflies the moments leading up to my visit of combined sheer giddiness and nerves that i would somehow be let done i m ecstatic to report that my dining experience at vetri was one of the top dining experiences of my lifetime and i found it to be truly everything everyone says it is and more upon entry to the restaurant i was actually a little uncertain the hallway was narrow and i had to walk through a crowd to get to the hostess stand that literally was the lowlight of the evening and that s not even horrible every aspect of the evening was stellar from there on out where to begin well to start i wish i was taking notes our server was so knowledgeable that i wish i could ve written down everything he said about the food and the wine the wine paring was extraordinary from the thorough to description to the actual pairing i had the six pour pairing and i d absolutely recommend going that route i didn t view the actual list until after the meal i didn t realize that they literally listed the wines and dishes they paired with on the page this is a great keepsake and guide for my own future pairings after our aperol spritz we started with a few snacks and a vegetable crudits platter for the table we passed the veggies and helped ourselves to the snacks from the center of the table our next course after the bread was our antipasti i didn t realize the plate in front of me was my tuna crudo and mine alone theoretically a group could share and pass everything we did to some extent however we mostly ate the plate in front of us based on specific wine pairings this does make sense taking a step back before our tasting journey began our server gave us some time to discuss the menu and our preferences i was told to not be shy if there was something i really wanted to try while the tasting menu had the element of surprise at every course the meal was centered around that initial conversation with the server from just looking at the menu there were a few standouts that i simply needed to try after the antipasti we moved on to multiple rounds of pasta mamma mia the swiss chard gnocchi with brown butter was one of the most exquisite things i ve ever eaten in my entire life the gnocchi melted in my mouth as the flavor of the brown butter sauce lingered this was served with the tortellini with truffle sauce that would ve been a knockout on its own i received the mafaldini with lamb shank ragu as my second pasta course this was my must have and while delicious the gnocchi still takes the cake special shout out to the delectable seafood in the tonnarelli al frutti di mare that i sampled for one of the other plates at this point in the meal i was starting to hurt however there was no looking back no food down no food left behind of course i had to sample the next round of bread that came out the sourdough no regrets either i rallied in time for our secondi in my case the milk fed veal with asparagus yet another standout from my initial menu review i ve said this before about veal however we have a new winner this was the best veal i ve had in my life we had two different preparations of this tender tender meat one was more tender and filet like the other was delectably fattier with a slight crisp there was a dollop of sauce however i preferred the veal in its own juices finally we reached dessert status based on our groups eagerness to try everything our server ended up bringing us one of each dessert option the pistachio flan was placed in front of me and the pistachio that oozed out of the flan upon dipping my fork was a highlight we literally based the plates around the table and it was great to try a little of everything i hit crazy status when the little pastry tray was placed in the center did i need to try one of everything probably not but when at vetri you try to eat it all while the food was phenomenal the staff added to the entire experience aside from our fantastic server the team work and collaboration of guest service was apparent we had so many people interacting with us throughout the meal that were aiming to please and perfectly harmonized with the actions of their colleagues i was smiling on the outside and smiling on the inside this meal is a true highlight in my culinary life so i m so thrilled the world isn t ending and i m not dying while i ve checked a major item off my bucket list it s only left me with the taste for more of the finer vetri cucina dining experience
2452,love it when we stumble upon a place like this we are not familiar with the area and were just looking for a place to have bkfst yelped it and sabrina s was 1 on the list loved how they repurposed the old woolworths the aesthetic is so cool we arrived at a perfect time as there was no wait the hosts and servers were all super friendly and attentive the menu is awesome food so freakin delish we were refilled on coffee and water and never had to wait to ask for anything service was on point if you re in the area this is def a must try
2453,my review of only 3 stars is based on the fact that we have such good indian options in indy that blow tandoor tikka out of the water don t get me wrong my food was decent but it didn t have the rich flavors i m accustomed to elsewhere i want my naan fresh and my tikka masala creamy and spicy and that just wasn t the deal here the tandoori chicken option is chopped up chicken in to tiny piece like ground beef only it s chicken i would go next door to the other indian place in this plaza if it were me my 14 lunch wasn t really worth it
2454,i had the vegan rob the kristen so good they have vegan mozzarella bacon and sausage i was happily surprised to find tasty vegan options while out for drinks
2455,good thing we had a reservation or else we would be waiting a good 1 2 hours the food was great but the service was a bit slow but it was super busy theres a good range of side dishes that come with the bbq the entrees were delicious got the seafood pancakes and japchae definately worth it
2456,this place is well worth the long ass wait although nothing fancy inside super tight the food was perfect we had the bananas foster french toast shrimp grits and absolutely loved both service was fine but the overall fabulousness of this place is the food itself thoughtfully prepared delicious,loved luke literally everything was delicious we had the brussels sprouts a bit overly glazed sweet for my taste but it really was good fried oyster salad and the shrimp grits everything was good my favorite though was the french 75 cocktail which was super delicious our waiter was even so kind he gave us the recipe for the brussel sprouts overall with all the nola options this should make it on your list i didn t do happy hour here but they supposedly have a great one
2457,i was skeptical because i couldn t get my pick up until after 4 because they don t begin making the pasta till then i was pretty impressed that the food was ready at 4 10 when the server said it would be freshly made and ready i make my own pasta at home all the time and this particular batch wasn t in the long strands like you can get in a store i mention this because someone who s a little picky may take issue with that i loved the giant meatballs and i can t believe that my meal came with an enormous and delicious foccacia that i finished off with a friend i come to philly all the time and i have a whole hit list of food when i m here a tutti has made the list which is a big deal because i have limited time and it s worth making space
2458,ok this place is great it is the quintessential coastal california seafood shack located on the wharf you walk up and out your name on the list with where you want to sit we sat at the bar and could see our dinner swimming in the tank in front of us started off with some oyster shooters and whooo weee did that have some good spice to it then a lobster roll butter and delicious everything was grilled or cook in front of us at the bar delicious now the service friendly and attentive explained menu specials and let me sample the brews on tap if i get back to santa barbara this is my dinner stop
2459,meh expensive and uncomfortable seating one family relocated to another table when one became available the mother said she expected more than a stool as their bill was going to be 300 they were sitting on metal stools like your grandpa has in his garage we ordered the sunday fried chicken dinner for two it was to be a whole chicken and sides the fried chicken was good but we were served five legs and two wings one strange bird my husband said it was built for speed lol we won t be back adding basil to everything doesn t make it italian
2460,this place is without a doubt the best lunch deal around the food is fresh hand made and delicious and only 10 for the buffet i would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys indian cuisine
2461,i went here last night with some of my friends good place but nothing to rave over i got the beet and goat cheese salad which was sub par the vegetable platter was amazing though huge good place to go with friends but nothing amazing good location and we sat outside
2462,wow what a fantastic nashville brunch spot we arrived around 10 45am and were a little worried about getting a table because the line was so long we put our names in and were told there was an hour wait so we decided to go stand by the bar and we were able to grab bar seats in minutes definitely plan to get here early or watch the bar if you want to be seated quickly they have a whole cold pressed juice menu so i decided to ask if their orange strawberry cold pressed juice could be turned into a mimosa and the bartender made it happen it was delicious for breakfast i went with the chicken and waffles which is usually a solid choice i was pretty happy with the ones served at mh the maple bourbon syrup was a nice compliment you can definitely taste the bourbon i wish i had been able to try the biscuit and the french toast dishes too others around us ordered them and they looked amazing this place is small but open we walked to the spot but it did look like there was a pay to park lot across the street mh is also located in a super cool neighborhood the gulch definitely a great neighborhood and brunch spot if you re in nashville
2463,mona lisa lounge is a hidden gem it has absolutely great prices a beer was 3 the bar tenders are amazing betsy and corkey they are the nicest people ever it has a friendly environment they make you feel like they have known you forever the crawfish boil was good and reasonably priced it is near the big east air boat ride we highly recommend it love this place
2464,this place is one of the best i have been to their other location in dunedin and it was completely different but both awesome in their own right clear sky on cleveland is a great spot for date night super chill atmosphere and awesome craft cocktails at the bar all of their food was super unique and an experience in itself i would definitely recommend
2465,service was a little slow to start but improved guacamole dip was very good we had a large group everyone was very pleased with their meal i had the el jalisco special it was very good and plenty of food for the next day the passion fruit margarita was very good also i would recommend this to anyone looking for a good mexican restaurant
2466,alex came over and easily fixed our issue he was kind and knowledgeable and he will definitely be our go to electrician we can t believe we forgot to review him i was just looking up his info to pass along to a neighbor
2467,we went to the boiling house this past saturday for lunch and it was phenomenal loved the seasoning on everything we ordered the seafood lover i highly recommend everyone to visit this restaurant
2468,are you kidding me this is without a doubt some of the best food i ve ever had my life the bread is the best and i cannot believe the chocolate croissant ambience is wonderful intriguing and very chic people are friendly and kind coffee looks great but i didn t try it yet i will be back prices are good too
2469,was looking for something new around the w 86th street area and found this slice of india the staff at this establishment are very welcoming and extremely accommodating the presentation of the entrees was great from the sizzling chicken to the traditional dishes the portions are well sized as they come with basmati rice slightly pricey but well worth it,just got my first custom tailored shirt from master lee today and went in to try it on i was blown away with how it turned out after my fitting a couple of weeks ago the entire process is quicker and the end product is much better than that of leon s tailoring in downtown indianapolis i was so impressed with the work that lee had done on my shirt that i ordered another shirt after seeing the results of the first i m looking forward to more business with lee s custom tailoring
2470,yes must have 1 banana foster french toast 2 shrimp and grits they managed to somehow get bananas fosters inside the french toast so when you cut it it s creamy oozey and so beautifully delicious must get the shrimp and grits has a barbecue style touch to it along with bacon and cuts of bread as you can see in the photos if you re a couple between 130 175 pounds this should definitely fill up the both of you best breakfast spot so far
2471,the service was a bit slow at first but improved once we ordered drinks the food was excellent and there was a lot to choose from it is very reasonably priced with large portions only major negative was the bathroom the bathrooms was disgusting which is never good at a mexican restaurant
2472,we had such a great brunch here food was excellent and our server was the nicest guy we ve met so far in nola thank you jonathan
2473,had a great happy hour dinner experience complimentary bruschetta yummy beet and fried goat cheese salad delicious penne alla vodka very tasty my limoncello martini and complimentary limoncello shot topped everything off just right the waiters are very attentive and friendly you will not be disappointed
2474,cute little local coffee house without it being a chain the coffee is delicious and i love all of the bakery items i just wish it was larger because oftentimes i cant find a seat and have to leave instead of staying and enjoying the ambiance but i don t want them to move because the location is perfect
2475,the fries were really good homecut can t be beat i had the falafel sandwich the falafel itself was flavorful
2476,finally a great pizza in florida if you like thin stone pizza with great flavor this is the place very impressed and jenny is a sweetheart at the bar
2477,breakfast omelets were good but the beignets were great live jazz band was playing at 8am on sunday morning and was enjoyable
2478,the fountain is a wonderful place for lunch cocktails ice cream sundae or all three decorated like an old fashioned art deco upscale old school ice cream parlor making the most of an old auto dealership the food and drink are amazing i had the high hat egg salad sandwich with brussels kale cup and a midtown mojito and topped it all off with the black cadillac ice cream sundae which is black cherry ice cream with hot fudge and whipped cream served in an old fashioned tulip sundae glass
2479,great place great lunch and even better great waitress gail you made our afternoon
2480,this review is overdue but not forgotten i had ordered 60 cupcakes for a baby shower last month i was a little apprehensive because i live in sc and i was looking for specific colors flavors and of course taste i dealt with katie who was extremely helpful and came through above my expectations i would definitely go back for any party cakes or even a stop in for any bakery need i m certain the other employees are as helpful and i d recommend and guarantee you would not be disappointed
2481,this is by far one of the best hot dog places on the west coast i ve been and my wife and have been everywhere from seattle to san diego the creativity of the different types of dogs will tempt you to destroy your diet plan and visit this place multiple times until you ve conquered every single one oh and i dare you i double dog dare you nice right to try the fried pickles
2482,i really enjoyed my very large fulling regular sized cheese steak meat was high quality and moist roll adequate and good not great though small fixings bar clean place good service reasonable price i would definitely go back if in the area other patrons orders looked good too,this arbys been here many years and parking lot and inside is forever empty i think there best thing is deli sandwiches roast beef is of poor to barely fair quality its very expensive for fast food quality doesn t match pricing usually when i eat here i regret it pity one would think that there signature item would be outstanding not at all many other places to chose from
2483,we got there late and things were winding down so i ll give them the benefit of the doubt that said it wasn t as impressive as i d anticipated and my moscow mule was watered down and not served in a copper mug as pictured on their website decent atmosphere regardless and the staff wasn t rude or annoyed despite our later arrival
2484,my boyfriend and i went to kuchi because we were really were craving sushi i got the kuchi roll and it was delicious and really fresh at the end of the meal they gave us free saki and ice cream for dessert the food is really fresh and the atmosphere is really relaxed recommend
2485,bangin this place has it all especially if you re looking for something quick and easy the food was fantastic the girl who took our order was as sweet as can be and the prices were great it only made it better than they had a straight up pickle pepper bar in the back
2486,out of 29 parks i would have to say this is the most kid friendly great variety of things for kids to do and all free disgusting when a park tries to get more money out you to entertain your kids i e detroit easy to get to with the subway nice sports complex with surrounding area and stadium with bars and stuff for pregame and postgame drinks decent crowd of people they don t throw full beer cans at opposing fans food and beer wasn t bad i only took off one star because eagles fans totally suck p i hope one day philadelphia will not tolerate the behavior that goes on next door especially when people pay thousands of dollars to come in from out of town to watch their team and visit a city that has brotherly love in it s slogan
2487,just got in from my 1st visit to oriental pearl and i loved it i wanted to try the pho but my mouth was watering after looking at the menu they have so much to choose from to start off we ordered vietnamese spring rolls which were delicious light and flaky with a wonderful side sauce i ordered beef with crunchy noodles as my entree so good the beef was tender green pepper and onion were cooked so that they weren t too soggy just right and the noodles were crisp with added flavor from the curry sauce wonderful my sister ordered the triple delight with shrimp scallops and chicken and she loved it she doesn t like spicy food either but said this was perfect not spicy hot we couldn t finish our platters but found room for ice cream with fried bananas perfect end to a great meal the service was great too food arrived quickly and the waiter and the mgr stopped by to ask us how everything was they offer additional sauces on the table one i fell in love with was plum sauce it s kind of like a sweet soy sauce omg so good and the owner was nice enough to give me a container to take some home too add this to your list of places to go it s casual and quiet nice place to eat and relax will definitely be back
2488,delicious sauces on boiled seafood combinations are unusual and don t sound good but are delicious the caribbean one was fabulous it s a little expensive
2489,i was beside myself taking in all the gorgeous treats in here it is a stunning shop with high ceilings and light and space to showcase the delectable baked goods loved trying samples of the gluten free peanut butter brownies which were moist and gooey and amazing picked up a vegan chocolatey carmel dessert that was utterly amazing and they have incredible dog biscuits which my fussy furry daughter gobbled up looking for more the woman at the counter helping us was beyond accommodating and pleasant and knowledgeable a friend wanted to meet becca primary pastry chef owner and she came out and hung for a bit and posed for pics a lovely soul this place is awesome
2490,what a fantastic place guitars are displayed well cool vibe and even cooler staff they are very welcoming and helpful not typical with a lot of nashville music stores they are a cut above in their selection while they don t have as many instruments as some other close by stores their inventory is much more consistent of high end vintage equipment you ll be wowed by what they do have and impressed by the helpful friendly staff i visited quite a few stores in the area rumble seat was definitely my favorite
2491,very fun place great reuse of a building with fun interiors beer selection was very good and food both happy hour bar food and dinner menu were quite good interesting and with some unique twists
2492,everyone loved their food modern industrial decor good service conveniently located in walking distance of wino for after dinner drinks the lava roll was excellent nice place for a date or business dinner
2493,wow amazing gelato tried the italian cookie dough and the dark chocolate one and loved both flavors the server was also very nice polite and conversational
2494,i can t say enough about ice cream 504 the only bad thing is it s with in walking distance and we re finding ourselves walking everyday to get some amazing homemade ice cream the flavors are spot on i d add a picture but it s always eaten before i get a chance a must stop if your in the area
2495,this was a great place for lunch food was delicious and prices were very reasonable the service was stellar we received from melissa
2496,i was in boise visiting family and one of my sisters raved about express cafe even though it was lunch time i ordered breakfast and it did not disappoint the pancakes are huge eggs perfectly cooked yummy bacon etc service was impeccable will definitely return on my next visit
2497,my friends and i had dinner here last weekend and as always it was phenomenal service was great as was the food definitely can t wait to go back
2498,i love banh mi and i will go out of my way to get a good banh mi much to my surprise i discovered a new spot in north wilmington for me the banh mi thit nguoi is the litmus test for whether i would be a returning customer if you re a banh mi place and you can t get banh mi thit nguoi right then i have a hard time justifying coming back to your establishment luckily the banh mi i had today was very good the bread wasn t too doughy the pate and cold cuts were quality the veggies were pickled right and the fresh veggies were well fresh like they should be they didn t skimp on the meat either which is always a big turn off i m so glad this new place opened and is not too far from where i live i don t have to trek all the way to philly to get my fix if you re looking for an authentic viet treat this is it
2499,we came here on our bus tour stop on magazine street the food was really good we had sliders chicken sandwich the best and a sugar donut which was sweet the atmosphere was nice not too loud or crowded and the music playing was really good its a nice place to stop by even just for a quick bite the staff was also very friendly and helpful
2500,great service marginal everything else happy hour happytizers were 5 the frozen onion rings were warm and oily the citrus wings were oily with small shards of bone or something else the special was blackened rib steak there was a hint of blackening the steak was thin but then they butterflied it making it too thin it was supposed to be medium it was really well the smashed potatoes were cool to warm the iced tea was good
2501,i just woke up and want this shit for breakfast my go to thai they can accommodate to veganism really easily and are super nice about it the waitress is such a sweetheart and always the same girl she s super quick to serve you and always deserves a wonderful tip just remember the hours cause they re kinda odd and i often go on the wrong days overall wonderful place and great food
2502,pleasant relaxed atmosphere with very friendly service food portions are very generous and exceptionally fresh will come back small staff and wait times may be a while if they re very busy but it will be well worth the wait
2503,nashville is for ice cream on a hot summer night big scoops of ice creamy deliciousness a short walk from omni hotel downtown where all the action is
2504,morrow s was recommended by an uber driver as a great local spot and lawd was he ever right the night before we went to neyows which turned out to be a flop however this place did not disappoint fantastic redfish garlic mashed potatoes and crawfish etouffee blair was fabulous good looking out waiting on desert but i m sure if it s anything like their food then it ll be yum yum well the hawaiian bread pudding came and bang they did their thing
2505,today was my first time and i was pleasantly pleased sat at the bar was not greeted right away but once she saw me she was very attentive the bartender recommended a great local beer the honey raspberry i ordered the smoked turkey club wow so very good
2506,amazing food an wonderful customer service mr rich is very nice guy beautiful atmosphere and clean place
2507,this is a lovely hotel but be careful not to leave anything in your car or your bikes on your vehicle we had 2 locked bikes stolen off our van and the hotel could not help us at all they have no cameras in the parking lot all they needed was one camera monitoring the entrance to the lot since there is only one way in and out it would of been a great help to us the room we had was small and nowhere to put the bikes a locked bike storage area for guests would be a great ammenity to this hotel what would of been a lovely stay turned into a nightmare for us we spent our vacation driving around looking for bike thieves
2508,everybody loves randy and he a man s sculptor with his vision be prepared to wait when you walk in but he s worth it
2509,i ve always passed by this place while on dale mabry and was interested because of all the people who sit outside outside in florida it must be good finally went and was happy not impressed but happy we went during brunch 2 mimosas crazy and no daily eats type wait it s such a roomy place and super casual even if there were a lot of people great place to meet up with friends out to catch up and eat i got the chicken sandwich with no cheese and the sweet potato tots we also got the pretzels as an appetizer which came out hot and good good service as well food wasn t overly impressive but still good will definitely come back
2510,it was okay at best prices were moderate really that on par where you would expect them to be the food was not the greatest almost tasted like it was a microwaved meal that being said perhaps it was just the dish i got i ordered the brisket portions were not overly huge and it was just boing meat was a little tough and chewy my wife ordered salmon and she says her meal was very good the best part of our meal was the appetizer do yourself a favor and get the nachos they were very good i think the other part of the diner that was disappointing was the service slow and un attentive was being kind i would probably never go back nor recommend this place hope this helps
2511,excited to have this place in reno delicious matcha and ube flavors like authentic friendly staff looking to get better but what they have as a base is solid soft serve cake and the sauces aren t overly sweet hoping they add more flavors
2512,today s experience has made me a lifelong valvoline customer if all employees operate the way these amazing mechanics do efficient fast friendly communicative oil changes aren t supposed to be awesome just don t tell these workers that
2513,not quite sure why there s so many bad reviews but i thought this place was pretty good the two times i had it i had it delivered once and the other time i ate in the quality was pretty good and it wast tasty and cheap i m definitely coming back to this place
2514,i went to their happy hour on a pleasant weekday afternoon and the outdoor patio was fantastic but well obviously not in the summer because it s too hot i went in the fall so the weather was still nice sit outside they have fantastic pizzas at an incredible happy hour price the pizzas are not in their regular menu so make sure you go during hh they also have a late night hh so check that out too great prices on drinks all about that hh i got champagne and rose and each for 5 bucks great deal service was great but if you re outside and they re really busy things might just a little slow service wise
2515,decent i had the feeling good burger and fry for 15 w water the burger was good and initially reminded me of wendy s but with a better grade of beef and a bigger serving per patty the fries were good but i could ve used a few more portion wise i hate getting halfway through a burger and running out of fries that should only happen on to go orders cause what else do you eat on the ride home i was kind of disappointed when i asked for the regular burger 10 with fried egg and i was suggested the feeling good burger 13 although i didnt want bacon she a shift leader i m assuming said just remove the bacon she shoulda just removed a dollar or two right obviously the items are either too pricey a la carte or they have no way of charging you for a single fried egg left me feeling just a little cheated otherwise service was hella friendly and the cook cool as a fan as a downtown lunch option i would come back if i really wanted a decent burger in walking distance i cant name a better burger between here to the municipal
2516,absolutely worth the 2 month wait for our reservation the service was five stars our server was incredibly warm and kind the hosts were very welcoming the atmosphere is lovely modern and sexy but still cozy and inviting we sat at an outdoor table at our request but still felt the warmth of the ambiance because the doors were open and the candlelight from the dining room still flickered our way the hamachi crudo with beautifully bright strawberries from california was brilliant the roasted wedge salad was out of this world hot full of flavor and texture with aged gorgonzola 20 year balsamic and thick salty bacon the evening s special was a tagliatelle with spring vegetables like peas and morels and it was a delicious celebration of the flavors we wait for all winter the whole bronzino with caperberries olives fingerling potatoes and a lemon butter sauce was without question the best whole roasted stuffed fish i ve ever had the fish was perfectly cooked crispy skin juicy flesh phenomenal flavor my husband and i ate every last miniscule bite finally the stawberry jelly donuts and melon sorbet were a beautiful closing to a spectacular meal the portions are perfect the meal was nicely spaced out we didn t feel rushed or lingered over but perfectly content outstanding all around the first thing i did this morning was to make another reservation we cannot wait to come back
2517,my wife an i headed down for a quick bite food came out fast and fresh tacos were perfect get the pitmanite service was great can t ask for more it is super casual and comfortable great homey vibe negative reviews i think are not taking it for what it is we loved it
2518,i finally got to this place after a long wait the mediterranean menu was inspired had the turkey thigh which was fork tender beautifully marinated besting most bbqs the cocktails were great as well
2519,i m not a fan but my wife is and since i am getting gyros for her while she is going through chemo i ll write my review based on her thoughts she has been several times and enjoys going here she likes the food especially the gyro it has good flavor ordering here doesn t take long and the food comes out quickly the staff is always friendly
2520,hadn t been to this chain in years can honestly say we won t be back the food was waaaay too salty and just not that good i ordered the chicken pad thai it was the worst pad thai i ve ever had i could barely eat it but i was starving so i sucked it up i felt like i was eating straight salt and hot sauce so gross our server was strange and not very friendly at all the hostess girls were so sweet though and extremely friendly
2521,amazing rich was our server and he went above and beyond hands down one of the best dinners on our trip
2522,this place is great for younger kids i would not bring anyone over 8 yrs old because it s geared more to younger kids there is a lot to see and do there are different stations the kids can play in and keep them entertained for hours this place is affordable
2523,i came here to check out the wi fi for a place to work out of not only do they have great wi fi but the choice of food here is incredible i decided to try out the all you can eat buffets wow talk about multitudes of choices you have a buffet table ful of pastry a buffet table full of breakfast staples such as scrambled eggs pancakes sausage and of course the famous beacons and a whole lot more i counted 5 hugh different buffet tables starbucks just lost it s normal customer to something a little more reasonable in cost and the choices of variety of food to be had if you haven t tried this place yet i urge you so check it out this place just become you new place to work out of if you work from your laptop smartphone and tablet as i do plus they do have a few plug ins something missing from a few other places you won t regret this choice the staff was very courtesy i don t know about those negative review i saw i saw no such thing from my visit i would now make this my normal place of work and its cost is so much less than starbucks that is if you buy the foods and drinks
2524,i had a great experience here i spent about an hour just checking out all of their inventory and admiring everything there is still a ton more i didn t have time to check out i picked up a bunch of lovely stones and i will definitely be back to get more prices were super reasonable and it s always great to support local businesses it seems gary has been in business for years and he really knows what he s doing edit i just read some of the other reviews and i must also agree that gary wasn t the friendliest of people but you can really tell that he is knowledgeable just don t expect him to talk to you about the magic of crystals i get the feeling he s all business and no fluff
2525,great service from gem state came in at 9 00 am and my truck was ready the same afternoon had a real bad noise from an installation of a large gas tank from a dealer these guys found that the def hose was not routed correctly and solved the problem no rattles inexpensive fix and super nice guys will definitely be back for my regular service and any other needs
2526,fantastic little spot love all their specialty drinks and how effort the baristas put into them they have free wifi and plenty of places to sit and get some work done place fills quickly on the weekends would definitely make this my regular spot if i lived closer
2527,i ordered the fish taco entre and it was very tasty the tacos were a good size with salsa that was flavorful the restaurant was very busy so i had to wait a while to order but the overall wait was acceptable i would recommend eating here if you do not mind large crowds
2528,came here for a work outing and had a great time staff was very friendly helpful and clear with the rules throwing the axes is easier then i thought it was going to be axe masters help you out with tips there are many refrigerators for you to store your beverages byob parking was easy
2529,while i will go into more detail there is one word that describes my lunch there today amazing i went there for lunch this afternoon with a large group of coworkers we were seated quickly in a large booth i loved the atmosphere very laid back and comfortable service was also very quick our server greeted us within moments bringing multiple bottles literally they were obviously previously booze bottles of water and filling our glasses we needed more time with the menu but as soon as we were ready he was there to take our order i got the southern classic pimento cheese applewood smoked bacon fried onions bread and butter pickles with a side of zucchini straws this burger was amazing it was cooked perfectly medium rare and the flavors blended together in a way i never thought was possible the burger patty was also very well seasoned and had that nice little crisp on the edges it is honestly one of the best burgers i have ever had the zucchini straws were also very good and the sauce they serve with them took them up another notch the rest of the table got a variety of burgers including the double major freshman stanford and the going greek we also had fries and tots everyone was super happy with their food the only complaint i heard was that the going greek was a bit on the small side compared to the rest of the options but the person who ordered it was very happy with the flavor even with the smaller size i will be back for sure the only downside i can think of is the cost with the sides not being included in the price of the burgers it can be a bit on the pricey side for a burger that said i feel like the quality and service make it very worth it
2530,this place was a real surprise the hostess at the door was very upbeat asking everyone to give a stars name for your place in line a great way to break up the wait that was well worth it for the food the food was very thought out and flavorful the pickles that are made in house are the best i have ever had
2531,so i really enjoyed this place will update on our second visit it was loud while we were there there was some sort of company event happening but they still had tables open even for happy hour seated us quickly service was great the menu offers unique delicious options even the happy hour menu bogo wines mon thurs 4 6 we both ordered sauv blanc were given one glass of light pink wine weird tasting one glass of sb we noticed so did ourv server who after waiving him back to our table said he noticed too but wasn t gonna say anything cuz it came out of the same bottle weird anyways whatevs he poured us a new one it was no biggie food was tasty especially after my french onion soup cooled down umm the hh frys with wine jam were super tasty like funnel cake moz sticks dipped in incredible jam great place happy hour or not they had me smiling in the bathroom bidet toilet aahhh yesss
2532,excellent tasting po boys but it could have had mire catfish pretty skimpy service very good
2533,once again you arent coming here for anything but the food it is a place most people will look at and drive by however it is another hidden gem of epic proportions they have a different way of making their food with a slight charred taste that is noticeable if you are any sort of regular at eating asian food i recommend the shanghai noodles the flat noodle and beef with black bean shredded pork crunchy noodle and a dumpling soup similar to a wonton soup this is another place that you will not regret if you try it they really shine at the fried noodle dishes so try keep it close to that if possible also try milk tea if you never have before
2534,probably the best lobster place in the area we love to go for the summer lobsters in august they couldn t be better
2535,i had my first industrial piercing done by charlie today he was incredibly nice and patient and his piercing technique was smooth and efficient the shop itself was also clean and inviting my industrial was also reasonably priced so i couldn t have asked for a better experience if chino isn t in don t be afraid to get pierced by charlie
2536,i like everything about first watch from the greeting when you arrive to the goodbye when you leave and everything in between you don t worry about searching for a server to get a coffee or water refill because the carafes are at the table the service is great and the food from the seasonal and regular menu is delicious there is nothing to complain about unless you don t like good food and awesome service
2537,los jefes is a hidden gem in metairie best mexican food you can find without going to south texas margaritas and enchiladas are my favorite
2538,everything about this special place is fantastic the people the food the location thanks for always being so welcoming y all are amazing
2539,stand in the line look our trip to nashville was two months ago and we still talk about it first don t let the line intimidate you there are a lot of bigger parties that want to be seated to our suprise they were halfway down the line when they found a party of two us we felt like our name had just been called on the price is right we were quickly seated and the waiter was so friendly and answered our questions with ease that cinnamon cream is the thing of perfection those folks back in that kitchen are doing it the pancakes were amazing bacon delicious coffee eggs heaven change the name to pancake heaven we want to go back to nashville but only for pancake pantry
2540,we had the chance to visit this restaurant after hearing so much about it we received a seat quickly after we arrived for a noon lunch and our waiter was there within 5 mins this was a thursday also during the week i ordered drinks and an appetizer before my guest arrived and it took awhile to get drinks but the wait was not long once my guest arrived we were ready to order we placed our entire order and received our food within 20 mins i ordered the oyster morrow stuffed with fresh crabmeat and the file gumbo i enjoyed them both but my gumbo was spicy and i noticed crawfish tails i had not had that in my gumbo before but okay maybe that s their signature item thrown in the pot lol overall i would return again and next time we will try the sunday brunch
2541,awesome vegetarian restaurant the brunch is a pre fixe menu with lots of great options all the dishes were generously sized so we left with full stomachs and some leftovers everyone enjoyed their meals a lot the restaurant is spacious and the service is good great spot for a nice dinner,only tried the beer here on a saturday evening with my boyfriend space was cozy and great for a chill spot we tried the ipa and the berlin vice both of our beers tasted quite watery not a huge fan of the beer but the food looked good so we may come back to try the food,overall a good experience the interior and decorations are really nice and service was good we had an early dinner around 5 and it was pretty empty but filled up as it got closer to 6 we ordered two ramen bowls two sushi rolls and a vegan poke bowl for four people and were satisfied the ramen was a great price point 11 and was pretty good thought the flavor of the broth could be richer but can t beat that price in this area the sushi rolls were good although i didn t try nigiri or sashimi so didn t get a good feel for the raw fish itself the vegan poke bowl was unique the vegan tuna in it could ve tricked me if i hadn t known beforehand cute spot with good food at a good price
2542,i wish more businesses were run like this establishment every time i have been there not only is the food amazing and fresh the service is above and beyond i went through the drive through the other day and one of the two happened to be down most would think screw this and just give up but no i stayed in line and figured it was worth the wait well wait i did not they had three employees outside with ipads to take peoples orders and it was quite fast and efficient the order was correct when i received it and it was delivered with a smile the inside of this location is always clean and the staff is always very nice more businesses seriously need to play by these rules and step things up
2543,i was told by many people to try this place out and it did not disappoint we went very early in the morning so we were in and out quickly i am told it can sometimes be a wait to try the delicious goodies here our group all tried multiple items the shrimp and grits were very good this came with fried shrimp for any one wanting to know as it is not listed on the menu as being fried still a very good selection for breakfast the biscuits were very moist and fluffy the coffee selection here is very good and high quality much strong than what we make at home will defiantly be recommending this place to friends and family
2544,service 5 drinks 5 atmosphere 4 food 4 small sample size everything was pretty amazing danny was our server and he gets mucho kudos we had two cocktails both awesome first time having a sazerac served in this way and the wise blood was super unique and sooo tasty we sat on the patio and i know tis the season but the mosquitoes we out in full force we got two small plates the octopus 5 and the heirloom salad 3 octopus was cooked perfectly with tons of natural flavor complimented by the seasonings peppers the texture was absolutely perfect the peppers can speak for themselves as always but oh so tasty in a perfect compliment to the tentacles the heirloom salad however left a few things to be desired there was almost no pork belly and the tomatoes were slightly under flavored i ll just leave it at room for improvement hopefully it was a one off other than that we will be back to experience more and more as we are crazy excited about all the intriguing menu changes
2545,a perfect definition of southern hospitality and hidden gem went to the neighboring swamp tour and they recommend you to this bar which is directly across the street all of the workers were so kind and welcoming they were offering to take tons of pictures of us and gave us beads they even treated my friend to a free shot for her birthday we purchased the bucket of beers for the swamp tour and it was incredibly cheap definitely worth it would love to visit this place again
2546,yum i tried meal prep reno this week for the first time and ordered 7 a la carte meals i was actually blown away with the quality and taste the shrimp steak and turkey meatloaf were my favorite of the 7 i ordered they are reasonably priced tasty and healthy i ordered 10 more meals for next week and can t wait to try more dishes i like that it s fresh ingredients and local unlike some other competitors where you pay more for it to be shipped frozen or from who knows where they also have great customer service and answer any questions you have quickly
2547,top notch the hot and sour soup was good with some subtlety the garlic sauce i ordered chicken with garlic sauce was the best i can remember eating and the veggies with it were nice i m a tough customer and rarely wowed by chinese food the portions are a bit smaller than typical chinese but i ll take quality over quantity all day and i left full for 10
2548,view amazing food was great our server was amazing overall it was a great experience we will definitely be going back highly recommend
2549,sweet and small a perfect little place to celebrate an anniversary would like to go back when the weather is cooler to take advantage of the cute patio
2550,finally got to check this cute place after exploring fishtown location is amazing great distance from frankford ave and the york dauphin mfl line staff was super friendly and helpful with the menu the cold brew options were exquisite and reading all the special drink title names was inspiring what made franny lou s the best was it s unique atmosphere quaint and aesthetic inside and sustainable features will definitely come back
2551,ready to fall in love want your little broken heart to be mended 2 words seafood beignet see below for your directions to bliss tucked in a little adorable neighborhood in new orleans we stumbled upon this hip little joint called katie s while we had heard it was the best place to eat in town we weren t convinced until you guessed it we took that first delicious bite of their famous seafood beignet stuffed with crawfish shrimp crabmeat onions cheese jalapeos mozzarella and topped with a jalapeo aioli a religious experience to say the least as an appetizer we were convinced that it couldn t get any better than that and then bam the bordeaux was delivered a pizza topped with cochon de lait roasted garlic spinach red onions scallions and a garlic butter cream reduction we were left speechless by the unmatched flavor the perfection of the dough the cochon literally melted in our mouths perhaps one of the most delightful culinary experiences i ve had in quite some time i ll let you be the judge
2552,service was pretty bad coffee was cold while waiting for the milk avocado toast was delicious fried chicken and biscuit was good eat inside lots of flys outside
2553,best every day pizza place in tucson in a casual laid back setting true neapolitan pizza all flavors meld perfectly this is not average american pizza so be sure to educate yourself on true italian pizza by dining here especially if you have not been to naples
2554,with 1200 reviews and 4 5 stars it s pretty obvious that pnp is a beloved tucson spot i can see why i loved it too the space is small and simple with a generous patio which wasn t open on our visit because it was cold prepare to have a hard time making a food decision as everything on the menu looks great i opted for biscuits and gravy with eggs and a side of turkey sausage can we talk about those biscuits they re huge like the size of my face huge and perfectly fluffy and topped with oh so good sausage gravy can we talk about my eggs perfectly cooked perfectly can we talk about their housemade sausage the turkey is a little spicy and the pork version is wonderfully seasoned if you eat meat and don t order one of these i am sad for you finally can we talk about matt if matt has your table you re going to have a good time because he s pretty great two thumbs up
2555,stopped in for lunch around noon on a saturday i expected it to be busy but there was only one other couple there we both got bibimbap i got tofu he got beef he also tried shrimp pancakes and kimchi both of us enjoyed our stone bowls my only complaint is that it was spicy which some people may not love but i enjoyed it one thing that was noted is that the beef is scarce but the portion overall was good he also liked both other dishes declaring the kimchi the best ever in addition we both got the ginger cinnamon tea that is made in house while i liked that it was not sweet he would have preferred a lift sweetness this is a great spot with excellent service and good food
2556,for our first time trying rembrandt s we were blown away such a stunning place the beermosas were delicious and the food was good can t wait to go back
2557,laurel liquor is my go to for alcohol i have a mobile bartending service business pour it up and i can rely on laurel liquors to have whatever i need at a reasonable price for all of my specialty cocktails www pouritupmobile com
2558,this is a wonderful little bakery and brunch restaurant i ve been a few times now and never been disappointed they are also very kind and extremely patient with my silly questions thank you for that they also have the best chocolate croissants i ve had in years unlike most places these days that fill their chocolate croissants with gobs of some odd overly sweet fudge like gloop they have just the right amount and it s not too sweet they re heaven
2559,if you re looking for an amazing breakfast you ve come to the right place i came here bright and early 8am and was seated right away the place is pretty small and a tight squeeze but has a lot of character i got the shrimp grits this meal seemed small at first but i was stuffed after i was in a slight food coma actually it was delicious the grits had a slight cheesy taste and it blended so well with the shrimp and the bbq sauce my auntie got a baked creole eggs to share with her daughter they loved it and also got a side of grits but couldn t finish everything even though this seemed small as well my bf got surrey s egg plate it looked sooo good the portion was really generous the food all together was amazinggg its a great breakfast spot for family style dining we left and passed by the restaurant again within a 15 min time frame and there was a long wait outside it was barely 10am come early,beignets after surviving a down pour the entire family came here soaked but were warmed up quickly with fresh beignets and hot chocolate coffee the place is a bit cold compared to the air outside the workers were not the friendliest but at least their beignets make up for it we got 5 orders of beignets and they all came out super fresh it was warm crispy at first bite and then soft it was so soothing after the storm
2560,quick and efficient also wanda was so informative great experience and will definitely will recommend
2561,super fun ice cream soda candy etc shoppe love the nostalgic feel clean feel and great ice cream i had a turtle sundae and the flavors were so good they make all their edibles in house and the staff were genuinely kind attentive and helpful great place for a date and for families bonus is the bomb toy store g willikers next door
2562,based on my experience i don t understand the negative reviews i was in a bind as i needed a suit pressed and a shirt laundered and i needed them back quickly so i could attend a funeral the young woman behind the counter politely explained that she couldn t get the suit dry cleaned in my time frame but that it could be pressed as well as getting the shirt laundered by the end of the day i came came back a little early and everything was ready the charges were less than i would have expected for a rush job she was extremely nice and everything was exactly as it should be i would definitely use them again when i m in the area
2563,i didn t realize hotel pick up was in a particular area of the city so we took the city bus and then walked to the address provided by the company took about 45 min from garden district i also didn t know the time frame of pick up the email from the company indicated beginning at 10 15am so we ended up waiting about 20 min or so then we noticed the tour bus stopped across the street not right in front of the address provided and needed to cross through traffic and ended up needing to run after the bus since it didn t wait for us the bus driver made the ride more interesting with some info about the area when we got to the site there were 3 buses of people waiting to check in so another 20 min or so of waiting in line the tour itself was pretty interesting it was pretty cool to see the houses in the swamp there were maybe 15 of us per boat so it was nice to have the smaller group overall the transportation was a bummer we left our place at 9 15am or so and got back to the city around 3pm essentially a 6 hr endeavor total for a 2 hour tour if you haven t seen swamps before it would probably be worth it to step away and see more of louisiana
2564,food 3 decor 2 ambiance 3 service 3 value 2 5 i was afraid before going to ralph s that i may encounter a place that relies on its reputation and standing to bring customers in instead of providing superior food and service i unfortunately left feeling that those thoughts were justified the caesar salad was incredibly underwhelming with clearly stale bread as croutons the red gravy was also very watery for my taste both dishes edible but not what i d hope for given this places high reputation we also sat with empty water glasses for our entire meal the saving grace was that my fiancee enjoyed her gnocchi entree
2565,what a great tasting deal for the family meal we officially are fans of their chicken wings and onion rings also will try to have the shakes next burgers were definitely bigger than a slider
2566,visited the pancake pantry on saturday morning waited 20 minutes to enter ordered three egg omelette with cheddar cheese sausage and mushrooms chef cooked it softly just as i requested and really piled on the sausage and mushrooms to my delight with an omelette the restaurant allows you to order three regular pancakes or fewer speciality pancakes had apple and banana cakes many other options available our waiter cory was very helpful and attentive will return the next time i visit nashville
2567,this place is my go toooo everything from the pizza which i can create your own to the quesadillas my favorite is the villagio quesadilla with shrimp omg it s amazing also they have great salads and wraps and club sandwiches everything is huge and fulfilling worth the money
2568,kelly s chick a boom room started off as our dinner spot as a lot of places nearby had stopped serving but this spot still offered dinner we ended up staying for several hours and hanging out after dinner one side is like a formal dining room and the other side had a bar a dj and lots of people dancing and having fun there was also a huge outdoor patio we started with a cheese board we added pimento cheese which cost less than 5 and was worth it we enjoyed all the items on the cheese board for my main course i ordered coconut curried mussels they were piping hot fresh and delicious it was saturday night and the place was hoppin there was a characterture artist who drew a lovely picture of myself my niece and my girlfriend along with one of the staff members we met that night i don t think we could have found a better spot in dunedin to hang on a saturday night
2569,yummo i m in love with the migas add chorizo and fresh juices it s one of my favorite brunch places solo or with friends try sitting at the bar if the wait is a bit much and see the magic happen behind the counter
2570,the food is high quality and creative but there are limited options for healthier lower calorie eating that i usually prefer for breakfast
2571,i ordered the turkey chilli and it was sold out i was so disappointed my meal consisted of mashed butternut squash lots of carrots and very tender beef it was bland it could of used a bit more seasoning i had the lemon pound cake for dessert it was delicious 1 scoop of ice cream was all i needed now the service was okay the table guy was more attentive to us than our waitress but i will say she had a lot of tables we basically had no drink with our meal
2572,this place reminds me of portland seattle i only had one gigantic doughnut the lemon icebox it was a bit too sweet being a doughnut place i expected it to be on point i recommend getting multiple chicken sliders because they are delicious the bread is nice and the chicken is cooked perfectly this place is busy so i d go before or after lunch time you order at the counter and wait for your name to be called when your order is ready there is free water available at the bar
2573,we came here tonight just for a date night we started with some basics of edamame and tuna tartare the tartar took me back to california the taste of fresh ocean and soft creamy avocado was just to die for then we had some creamy rock shrimp that had a tiny bit of spice at the end which was pretty good too we also had the miso soup which was one of the best miso soups we ve had this was followed by our version of surf and turf where we had sushi rolls and their steak we were nothing but satisfied with all of the flavor profiles we were able to enjoy during this entire meal if you get a chance please check this place out they also have amazing cocktails
2574,this place is a hidden gem best sushj and prices in town highly recommend the beef tataki hibachi noodle bowls and the hibachi rice the sushi chefs take the plates to the next level with their vegetable and sauce art on each sushi plate
2575,well if you lived tony angelos you will feel right at home put down the menu and get the feed me
2576,my 5 year old had a blast didn t want to leave so much to do but i bet he falls asleep quick on the way home today was the last day of the circus exhibit which was probably his favorite at least getting shot from the cannon he also rode the carousel which is a century old the play areas next to the carousel would have kept him busy all day
2577,we stayed at the palomar hotel and stopped by for a drink one night very pleasant and our waitress i think sasha was very nice and accommodating we stopped by the next day for an afternoon drink and decided to make reservations for dinner that evening we asked our server if we could have the same table nice window seat we were seated and she said of course we left a nice appreciative tip two hours later we arrived for dinner place about 1 3 full and of course the table we d requested was filled that was disappointing but not as disappointing as dinner calamari was pretty rubbery entrees just so so server was mediocre never came by to refill wine or water but did have time to watch the big screen tv a generous three stars only because of our first experience
2578,wow a client recommended this place to me like a million other new yorkers our move to tampa has not found great food this place is the real deal if i could give ten stars i would deli coffee bakery homemade pasta everything you need and even what you don t this will be on my monthly shopping list for sure treat yourself p s the meatball parm sub was amazing well worth the drive from tampa
2579,food and service is good the chef sergio great guy and had bright future of him hope to see him next time as the head chef
2580,i went there for happy hours with colleagues ww ordered pig rinds sliders ribs and a pork moose dish all overwhelmingly salty i ended up boxing all of the food and gave it to my dog the service was nice and quick our server came to check on us every 5 minutes and filled up our water the bar was also very empty that night overall it was a nice place to hang for happy hour drinks but def not food
2581,the waiter chris is a true craftsman at his trade the food is very good as well the view is to die for just a great time and place for lunch or dinner
2582,good food for a good price it was laid back and next to a dog park so we loved getting to watch all the pups come and play the food was excellent such a great lunchtime spot
2583,my partner and i had dinner here on friday night and we were extremely impressed with the extensive veggie menu and the wonderful service the garlic naan was on point along with the veg korma paneer tikka masala and malai kofta we ordered it mild because i m super caucasian and it was perfectly spicy for me without being too hot topped off with chai it was the perfect indian meal we are definitely looking forward to returning for the lunch buffet which the owner said has 6 meat dishes and 6 veggie dishes and is available 7 days a week can t wait
2584,best oysters i ve ever had hands down excellent service and great happy hour selection definitely recommend
2585,great lunch sampler and fun for larger groups having habachi style the restaurant has a regular sit down dining area in addition to places for parties i ve always found the food fresh and reasonably priced
2586,this is my favorite burger joint hands down it wa terrific every burger they have is amazing and their homemade sauces top everything off i ended my trip with a salted caramel malt which was perfect and the the customer service is also outstanding we had a slight mix up in the kitchen and the server and manager were more than happy to give me a replacement sandwich free of charge if you go ask for sam as your server she s is outstanding
2587,envie is a great spot for people watching or reading the baristas are friendly and good at making espresso i haven t had much of the food but what i have had has been good
2588,so good been ordering here for a couple months now always fresh hot and consistent very clean location with friendly staff,really good calzones subs and cheesecake portions are very good size always hot when we order take out and never soggy
2589,food has always been delicious all of the food comes with a generous amount of meat and seafood unlike some other places who fill the container with mostly vegetables they are quick too
2590,aston is a small town devoid of many appetizing lunch spots until plum my choices have been limited to pizza fast food primo hoagies the giant salad bar or poppy s no regrets with poppy s they are wonderful my boss and i decided to try plum s takeout today the place is quaint with bright purple tones and a penny laden counter the friendly owners were working as well as their adorable daughter who was busy making macaroni and cheese we tried the squealer mutha clucka macaroni and cheese and housemade brownies both sandwiches were piled high on hoagie buns the meat was smoky and paired well with the fresh tartness of apple slaw i loved the spicy jerk sauce with the mutha clucka my suggestion to the owners would be to serve it sliced in half because it s a monster to handle i wasn t a fan of the fries on top but after removal my sandwich was amazing the macaroni and cheese is everything it should be creamy cheesy goodness decadent and seasoned with a blend of herbs and spices i m hoping this place thrives as i have my eye on their shrimp tacos and empanadas next time
2591,i used to stop into this bellacino s location once in a while when i lived in this neighborhood i was around here last thursday in the early afternoon and hadn t eaten lunch so i decided stop in i ordered a 12pc toasted ravioli and a soda to go my bill was 13 and some change i thought this was a little excessive for an order of frozen toasted ravioli it wasn t bad it was just status quo some of the ravioli were over fryed and the filling had oozed out and some were fine all in all decent lunch on the go but for over 13 i could have sat down at almost any restaurant in town and had a leisurely delicious lunch and been waited on
2592,definitely a hidden gem in trenton for some pretty legit pho definitely seems like a family run establishment and their pho definitely hits the spot vietnamese iced coffee is extremely strong however even after asking for it to be not very sweet it was still made extremely sweet the main issue of our visit seems to be that the restaurant is really understaffed during busy hours there is one older lady running everything from the cash register to bussing tables and we had to wait a really long time for food to come out as well as to pay
2593,i looked at many companies that provided this service and chose then based on the customer service attitude that they had when they bid the job and price i found them to be extremely knowledgeable and professional i was very impressed with both the sales representative and also the crew that actually did the job my new gutters look really good are color matched to our home and were a reasonable price i would certainly recommend them to anyone
2594,the shop is an amazing space their attention to detail and services are unbelievable plenty of places to have private meetings as well as post up and get work done
2595,great little hole in the wall resteraunt great lunch and breakfast they give you plenty of food and are friendly
2596,both the salon spa services people overwhelmed me with their spirit the love they show for their professions from emily well did my nail services to april who helped me since my haircut difficulties to loni sp who did miracles squirrel on my face facial and even the receptionists in front represented a true team of caring individuals my family lives in the area now i know where to go when staying in eagle 1 13 2018 still super enjoying my haircut just going for a trim again over the last few months i recceived at least 7 complements on my skin i purchased skin care products from them as well note i am 62 years old so the skin complements are simply amazing just fyi
2597,we ve been using ranger for ten years and they have excellent and responsive service no one is better
2598,food is awesome i ordered dan dan noodles wonton in chili oil and garlic chicken best time to visit weekdays best time 1pm 5pm on weekends it s better if you reserve and in here you can bring your own bottle of wine beer
2599,i love ramen and have tried multiple ramen places in tucson i heard a new ramen shop opened and decided to try it out i went with a group of 5 friends 6 total on a friday night so it was a pretty long wait 40min however the wait was worth it i ordered the spicy miso ramen and it came in less than 10min the noodles were cooked well broth was delicious and the meat was amazing not to mention our server john with an h was the best server ever he made this experience even better he had a great sense of humor not to mention brought us water 3 times we love h2o i wish i could come here every week
2600,beautifully appointed hotel in the heart of the tourist district with large rooms i like the attention to detail such as interesting books in the room yoga mat in the room and umbrella the food is good and not outrageous the decor is a little out there but cool the only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is that i would have loved a fitness center and apparently they don t have one whoops they do have one up one more star and they allow dogs of all shapes and sizes at no charge and the dogs are all well behaved
2601,very good experience getting delivery for the first time here food was very good egg fu young with chicken chicken lo mein chicken with broccoli food arrived hot and fresh
2602,don t let the big crowd scare you away these people know what they are doing the line moves fast check out the menu on the side of the building so you know what you want when you order the custard concretes were delicious we had to reese s and one oreo the prices are fair for what you get just eat it fast bc it melts quickly
2603,absolutely loved this place we were seated the moment we came through the door food was amazing service was super attentive will definitely be back for another great experience
2604,really tasty thai food in the heart of broad ripple i ve eaten or gotten take out from here close to a dozen times and have never been disappointed if you re unfamiliar with broad ripple it may take you a minute to find it but it has a decent sized parking lot which is like having a shop unicorn in br so you ll find some relief at the end of any search it probably fills up quickly at peak hours but has plenty of space off peak my new favorite dish is the tofu larb salad disclaimer this may be as close to a salad as a jello salad is but it s a great alternative to a heavy rice meal and there is a little bit of green i ve also had the curries which are really generous sized and delicious service has always been great and on a nice day you can t beat their outdoor patio along the canal
2605,this is a pre review review based solely on the reviews i have read i am very impressed whenever a restaurant takes the time to respond to reviews it shows me they are dedicated to service no restaurant is perfect all the time and not every employee is diligent but the governor s management s responses are direct and to the point i will certainly be stopping here my next trip to nola in 5 looooooong weeks
2606,this is my favorite train station of the northeast area amtrak stations 30th street is very easy to navigate and the main hall is spacious so it doesn t feel hectic and busy the old fashioned flip board that displays the arrivals and departures is wonderful and the clacking noise the sign makes when it flips over to a new time is soothing somehow there are a lot of bathrooms so i ve never had to wait too long in line also usually relatively clean the food court options are decent although most kiosks are closed in the evening and weekends the philadelphia pretzel factory stands are usually open though and the pretzels are delicious and an unbelievable deal the pub is also a reliable friendly place to get food or kill time
2607,probably the best breakfast i ve had out of the house and the went out of the way to accommodate my wife s dairy allergy
2608,phenomenal food the stuffed dates app was amazing a symphony of flavors the dueling bread app was great too the midsize plate of grilled octopus was incredible so perfectly cooked and seasoned just enough to flavor while still letting the subtle flavors of the meat come through a true gastro pub
2609,my family and i ate here after my graduation and i am so glad we did at first glance i was a bit skeptical because the place is so small but we were sat fairly quickly the service was great staff was very attentive to our large party we ordered hibachi sushi rolls and edamame which was all delish my favorite was the tempura lobster roll even my granny who has never tried sushi enjoyed it to our surprise we received a 10 gift card for our future visits since this visit i ve ordered tomo on grubhub and it was still as good as it was in house
2610,the food and service are absolutely fantastic definitely a good combo of diner california cuisine whether its 7am or 2pm its a must
2611,i never try trini food before i visit this place it s like a food adventure for me the oxtail is amazing unbelievable tasty i will 100 return this place for the oxtail dish the jerk wing is also very favorable i don t quite enjoy the goat roti is a ok dish for me
2612,the ambiance is good in itself but the food is mediocre for the price that you re paying i feel like the dish that i got was a bit too much for what it was i really didn t understand why there was so much mustard in a dish with lentils and sausage every bite that i took was basically mustard filled the sausage was good though but you honestly don t get that much food for what you pay if you come here is more for the look of the place than anything and i also don t recommend if you want breakfast food it s more lunch than breakfast
2613,dr steiner is absolutely wonderful she has a lovely bedside manner with my 3 dogs and even my shy guy happily accepts her handling my dogs are never shaking or frightened to come to cinnaminson animal hospital but tail wagging and excited to be there and see their staff the prices are very reasonable considering the phenomenal care that they provide thanks for keeping my little pack happy and healthy
2614,love this place they have a wide selection of feed both seeds and pellets and toys for birds staff are friendly and very knowledgeable if you get a bird here it comes with a complimentary vet exam which was really nice their grooming service is for nail trim beak trim and wing clipping you can get all 3 together or 1 or w e we love looking at the baby birds they have in the separate room absolutely adorable
2615,great lunch specials it can be kind of busy at lunch time so if you are restricted on time it may not be a good choice but the lunch specials are decently priced and are more than enough food make sure you get a tiramisu even if it s to go
2616,the steak was good my wine was ok our service was a bit slow at the get go but picked up it s very strange to see baileys chocolate bar reimagined but the atmosphere was nice
2617,we waited more than four years for this restaurant to open after peabody s closed as a local and an aspiring vegan i am delighted oliver s opened on coast village road beautiful setting and decor the dishes are hit or miss some have more flavor or substance than others i ve eaten here 3 times i would eat here every week if not so pricey i hope they start having lunch service soon
2618,i love kelly s but there is a huge difference in atmosphere and menu the normal crowd and vibe is gone empty
2619,i love this spot the decor the music the food the overall vibe we ordered the turkish hummus and it was everything the freshly made pitas won in every way the avocado rice was good too but it is cold fyi the lamb meatballs was good too but pretty small and doesn t quite feel like a complete meal still wholeheartedly recommend
2620,unique is very professional and based on my experience operates with the utmost of integrity responsive transparent honest are a few words that come to mind there technicians were efficient clean and pleasant their pricing was extremely fair i can state all of this with the highest degree of confidence because it is based on direct experience not conjecture or inference the sales person i dealt with mike p and manager chris are both top notch the house was left spotless the work was performed to the highest standards i recommend them highly i also encourage you to compare their prices to outfits of similar size and stature
2621,favorite breakfast coffeehouse great service always i visit here at least once a week the healthy bagel is highly recommended he has the best fresh teas
2622,i used to use avis just close by and after messing up a few times and trying to charge me for fuel even after a filled the car at the bp close by and showing them the receipt and an argument over a broken fuel gauge i never returned so far after several visits hertz has been great i m in the presidents circle and my treatment has been great pros i got to select my own car which was an suv and paid for a midsize regular shuttle bus and they were friendly both times my car was undercover quick ride from the airport and nice location to access i70 car was clean i like electronic receipt return option which made the drop off quick cons hertz accidentally charged my personal credit card instead of my work one i tried at the gold booth to change it and was told to ask at the booth leaving the booth leaving told me to go back inside after lining up for a few mins to leave to change it the line leaving was 6 cars deep and not moving fast they did open up a 3rd lane which got me out fairly quick i ll be back
2623,here on saturday morning it was packed but we waited a total of 15 minutes from start to finish the donuts themselves are excellent alone we got half a dozen one maple glazed bacon one peanut butter chocolate drizzle one blueberry powder one lemon coconut one blueberry coconut and one glazed chocolate and we both shared a bite out of each no complaints order by preference i mean what can you say about them they re donuts they re slightly crispy fresh hot and yummy
2624,great vetco service allowing me to get a bordatello shot for my dog while on vacation the whole staff was very nice and the wait was relatively short 30 mins received mend this service if you need vaccinations and don t have a veterinarian yet prices for food and other items are pretty high
2625,michael brown gives it 10 thumbs up with regards to their menu specials drinks delicious foods superb atmosphere and exceptional service justin dawn i expect to make this our new home for a tasty exceptional experience please stay as the fall winter is the time we look for a place where we could visit multiple times weekly and not be bored by what is great food and drink
2626,we always have excellent food here and the atmosphere is very fun we love to bring out of town guests here for a visit the bakery is lovely as well
2627,we stopped here to keep the night going after enjoying dinner at a near by spot they had a live band going so that made it plus nothing like live music in nola the spot was small so try and get there early to get a spot bartenders are solid
2628,amazing food great atmosphere glad we now have a quick way to get our indian cuisine i will definitely be back and bringing friends and family
2629,i will start this review by saying bless the hands that makes their food li l dizzy s is soo dang good it is a family establishment which is so nice you really feel the warmth of the establishment also dizzy is named after the owner s wayne baquet grandchild the first thing i ate was the grilled biscuit that biscuit was fantastic i didn t think it could get any better but guess what it did i ordered the grits eggs and catfish with a side order of the fried chicken that fried chicken was so darn good it literally was the best fried chicken i ve had the skin was just the right amount of crispy and the seasoning was amazing i love thick grits and li l dizzy s grits was the perfect amount of thickness the owner wayne baquet was very personable and kind also another staff person came to check in on us i did not eat the buffet but they do offer a buffet for 17 99 i didn t get it because i planned to eat later the the buffet included gumbo fried chicken the sweet tea was the perfect level of sweet i wasn t a fan of the catfish it tasted like the river to me and my sister however we are city gals so that review with a grain of salt i will definitely be coming back and next time i will try the buffet
2630,stayed here for 3 days first of all this hotel recently changed from oak something hotel and is now a super 8 it is obvious that there were some upgrades done to the hotel so reviews older than 3 months may not accurately display the space location this hotel is located 4 mins away from the airport and is surrounded by other hotels the hotel is less than 10 mins from opry mills mall and is about 12 mins from downtown nashville room the room appeared to be clean and upgraded when we arrived there is a microwave and mini fridge the room also has its own thermostat breakfast muffins instant eggs biscuits and gravy yogurt toast terrible coffee oj and apple juice pool hot tub gym the hotel and pool are massive they are indoor the hot tub does not have jets the pool is 5 ft deep the gym is one small room with the main workout equipment and tv the pool hours are listed 10am 11pm but the front desk manager said we could use the pool whenever as long as we were quiet things to note our room was cleaned once over our 3 day stay the one time it was cleaned the cleaning staff made the comment you know we can t touch your stuff right not really sure what that even means we were not provided mini shampoo or conditioner ect someone dropped some nuts on the ground in the stairwell and they were there our entire stay the hotel smelled of weed overall the standard of cleanliness for the hotel was very low
2631,beyond thrilled with my full set hai did a beautiful job i will definitely come back
2632,holy moly my family loves pizza and dominick s blew us away we got a large mushroom and pepperoni pizza and it was simply fantastic i can t wait to go back to dominick s already
2633,this acme is open 24 hours which is good for me they have a section for gluten free products other products through out the store are labeled a such as well the beat time to go to avoid the long lines is definitely late night their products are a bit higher than other markets i frequent for the convenience i will pay that for now i have encountered several expired products have brought this to the manager s attention in the past make sure the dates are checked on everything before you pay they are good with accepting returns but save that receipt it s a good place to pick up a few things but heavy duty shopping i ll reserve for elsewhere update well keep checking those dates i returned a month later expired organics vanilla soy milk exp august 13 2018 for sale
2634,my husband and i had dinner here last night what a great experience the staff were extremely pleasant we were seated right away our waitress was very attentive and insured we had what we needed in a non overbearing way and the food was fantastic we both enjoyed our meals the pad thai i had was the best i ve had in a long time my only critique would be the appetizer we had the golden triangles was lacking they were a little too soggy and the sauce could have used a little kick another that a we ll definitely be back
2635,good restaurants are hard to find in southeast delaware county especially italian restaurants while being within close proximity to south philly and media is great it s still nice to find a cozy authentic italian byo just a few minutes away from home we d heard about portobello cafe for years and finally had a chance to try it and it did not disappoint the food was fantastic from one of the best versions of veal saltimbocca we ve ever had to a veal chop milanese that was well oversized delicately fried and covered in a perfectly dressed salad of arugula radicchio tomato and red onion they had a variety of specials as well and when our table couldn t decide on dessert they brought us out a sampling that included their tiramisu chocolate cake cannoli and cream puffs dinner for 4 that included 3 appetizers soup or salad for all 4 entrees a basket of house made garlic bread and dessert cost us around 210 pre tip which wasn t bad considering the portion sizes and quality look forward to going back again sooner than later
2636,first time here was recommended by some friends the place was pretty busy when we when on a monday night which was a good sign we were greeted promptly and seated a server took a drink order right away another good sign they brought out garlic rolls another good sign we ordered different pastas and baked clams all very good this is not a high end place it s a good neighborhood spot if you re in the mood for italian and don t want to spend a fortune we will return and next time see what the desert menu looks like
2637,we were craving cheesecake and i went online and googled who has the best cheesecake we really didn t want to go towards the mall so we went to aj s i went to the bakery and everybody was super sweet and initially i only saw 1 slice she went in back and came out with a whole new cheesecake it was amazing and the crust was perfect i would highly recommend aj s
2638,after so many wawa soups you almost forgot how nice it is to get a real meal the chicken escarole soup was excellent great cheesesteak also the bar has good seating and a nice selection of craft beers prices are good also they have a friendly staff as well
2639,absolutely delicious we came from washington d c and tried it if you re in philly you should definitely grab a bite and don t forget the cheez fries
2640,love their lemon grass chicken and the salt and pepper tofu lunch specials are very reasonable very tasty and usually come out fast
2641,awesome place for the guys to get a haircut all the barbers were friendly and eager very eager to cut the next customers hair highly recommend going here
2642,aptly named after the amendment to the u s constitution which repealed prohibition this quaint little tavern is located in the heart of the french quarter and is truly hidden in plain sight despite its prominent location the 21st amendment bar often lacks the attention it deserves making it a french quarter oasis for patrons who need a reprieve from the hustle and bustle of bourbon street the interior of the 21st amendment pays tribute to its name willing patrons to believe they have just stepped into a prohibition era speakeasy with smooth jazz craft cocktails and unparalleled service this is a stop you can t afford to miss on your next trip to the french quarter
2643,the type of bar a vigilante would go to after a night of fighting crime think josies bar from dare devil it s either you appreciate the charm or you re going to think this place is a dump with a terrible bathroom i personally love it because once you enter it s impossible to distinguish what year it is it could be anywhere between 1986 or 2018 it s stuck somewhere in time like i said if you can appreciate the charm you re going to love this place
2644,fabulous service nice menu offerings the shrimp and grits was very tasty i appreciated how the water glass was kept full throughout the meal and when they ran out of the local beer i was drinking i feel like the waitress went out of her way to bring me other options to taste so that could make a decision on what to drink she had a several options and that went a long way to my satisfaction we had 5 for dinner and all had great meals
2645,the service here is always stellar the staff takes the extra time to make sure they have taken care of every possible need this is something i always appreciate the lounge area is beyond description converted from a train station lobby it s architecture is something to be appreciated
2646,this place is awesome shop here from time to time good prices employees provide excellent customer service they really care about their customers they have a cute liquor section and a starbucks all inside come check it out
2647,really nice chill spot excellent location great place to eat good food smoke hookah drink a good drink while watching the game and listening to music my new must see place when i m in nashville
2648,the ice cream itself is very tasty but the service lacked something to be desired for example there were 3 teenagers standing behind the counter that were less than attentive because they were to busy talking to each other also the main reason i visited was to get the waffle cone which was very good last time and they didn t even have them available
2649,so good i enjoyed the rocket power juice so refreshing i tried the naanwich with avocado i think they put an entire avocado in it so didn t skimp on fresh ingredients the menu has so many things that sounded amazing that i started simple but i will be back to try more cute atmosphere inside and outside seating you can literally watch them make your stuff worst is the downtown parking but i came for a late lunch so not bad
2650,great cute place to go for fresh veggies and fruits did the hayride 9 for two people and had a nice farmer doug he was very kind and helpful the hayride was a little short but it depends what is in season i wish they listed hayride times good time overall on a budget as well
2651,dr wendy is a miracle worker and i go see her once a week she is one of the best acupuncturists i have ever been to i also love there acupressure massages
2652,what a find great food reasonable prices and great atmosphere i had the fish tacos though i wish i would have ordered the shrimp one s after i took a bite of my husband s i got a side order of the battered green beans they were suppose to be spicy but i was told they didn t make them spicy that particular day well okay then i ordered them anyways and i was so glad that i wasn t deterred by the fact that they weren t spicy because they were the most lightly battered perfectly crunchy and delicious green beans i have ever tasted to top it off the beautiful santa barbara county day made the outdoor ambiance the most perfect date for my husband and i
2653,the food here is a bit pricey but if the food is really amazing it s not just hotels restaurant food it s actually good the reviews for the crab and corn fritters all looked good but they were amazing words can t do them justice they had the perfect crunch but were light and airy and filled with lots of crab meat the brussels sprouts are also amazing come here for drinks and apps and you will be sure to love it
2654,this is now my favorite seafood restaurant in the city we sat at the bar and had the pleasure of having 3 waiters chloe our actual waitress was amazing so friendly and personable curtis and dee the most amazing oyster shuckers were all amazing as well and awesome at what they do the service they all provided was top notch we ordered the chargrilled oysters barbecue shrimp pasta and stuffed fish all delicious we will definitely return and we will be sitting at the bar
2655,great family friendly restaurant with great food specials and deals today i had their ravioli special and it was the perfect portion size and had amazing flavor my sister had the veggie wrap and raved about how delicious it was and that they used sprouts in their wrap which sprouts are hard to find in restaurants the servers were all super friendly and made our experience the best we will definitely nce coming back
2656,omg this pizza is amazingly delicious i read the reviews and it seems the chicago style is the people s fave so that s what i went with i was skeptical because most chicago style pizzas aren t fully cooked and gummy in the center not this one this pizza was fire perfectly cooked all the way through premium ingredients loaded i ordered the 10 with pepperoni sausage bacon mushrooms garlic jalapeos onion and bell pepper i could only eat one slice i am full i am satisfied and i will be back
2657,i like the location in the former spot occupied by cardwell s my initial observation is that the restaurant is far too noisy to hold a conversation if you re going to eat there with someone you want to speak to definitely eat in the bar area or outside the food was just ok and not impressive for example if i was going to denny s and i ordered the pasta with morreale mushrooms and and an order of sea scallops it would ve been the best meal i ever had at denny s unfortunately i was paying 70 for food that did not impress me both dishes were just ok i would tell everyone it s worth eating at one time but not the second for celebrating our wedding anniversary it was a disappointment
2658,this was such a great bar the owner and staff are extremely nice went as a tourist and they gave us great tips on what to do with our time best hurricane drink in louisiana
2659,three stars but that had a lot to do with service being good as far as the food was concerned i was pretty underwhelmed if i m being honest having rather recently dined at a different seafood boil establishment the shaking crab in norfolk va i had a pretty good comparison pretty fresh in my mind and with that the boiling house under delivered celebrating my mothers graduation we decided to stop in and get a little messy on some seafood or vietnamese noodles apparently this place is both a seafood boil and asian noodle house ooook after my mom threw the whole night into turmoil by ordering off the menu which the staff were gracious enough to accommodate we got on track and ordered one vegan in our party went with just cajun fries not many vegan options here if thats a concern for you another has an issue with seeing her food look like it looks before its food why did we come here again so she went with some noodles and my mother was playing fast and loose with the menu so as far as the seafood boil goes it was down to my sister and i to split a bucket snow crab legs shrimp potatoes corn and a ciabatta roll boiling house sauce medium first thing that was weird was that although everything has to be ordered by the pound our crab legs had to be ordered in 1 1 4 pound increments uh ok whatever second thing is that the corn was mushy boiling corn must be a hard thing to do as it was the same problem at the shaking crab third thing and this is a big deal were the shrimp the shrimp were a good size but they may as well have been made of pencil erasers they were soooooo chewy and way more egregious than that the shrimp weren t cleaned yuck it took me 10 minutes before i could even start eating because i had to clean every shrimp myself the rest of the food was okay the crab legs were fine the potatoes were fine but nothing blew me away the sauce was ok decent flavor decent heat a little watery i was just like meh the whole meal our server was cool and put up with a lot my mother is a handful but he was polite throughout asking the kitchen to make her special dish and even pointing out to us that there is a military discount so we got 10 off of the meal the place was nice inside and its byob with no corkage so they definitely have that going for them i can t say for sure either way if i d be back or not again i wasn t thrilled with the meal but aside from the shrimp i wasn t put off by anything either i guess we ll see oh the floor is like the icecapades we all almost broke our necks walking in and our waiters assistant slipped and knocked over a bucket of ice wear something with some grip
2660,decided to give this place a try after i was craving a good cuban my go to cuban spot is big stein s down the road but wanted to try something new they definitely have a lot of options and is a a very cute restaurant i got the lunch special which was the hot honey turkey wrap pressed i was kind of confused when my bill came out to 10 when the lunch special was 6 99 but i m assuming that s because i got the soup as my side the soup by the way was cold it s just an assumption that my soup would be hot because well it s soup so that was disappointing i will give this place another try for breakfast seemed like they had a lot of good options and its served all day my wrap was good but didn t have enough turkey,hella s has been my go to greek restaurant in tarpon it never disappoints and the atmosphere is great the saganaki aka the flaming cheese is by far my favorite thing on their menu i could eat the whole thing to myself definitely a must try their mussels are also amazing and have great flavor make sure to dip your bread in the sauce their gyros are also by far my favorite gyro in tarpon full of flavor and the toasted pita bread is delicious
2661,these are great folks and you won t find a finer reputation integrity at it s finest an outstanding value head and shoulders above boise s other offerings
2662,very tasty and a healthier alternative to ice cream or frozen yogurt def big enough to share
2663,we come here pretty regularly for our mexican food cravings real easy menu and affordable friendly staff too
2664,i signed up for will s classes to help me get me back in shape before my wedding will is very motivating knowledgeable and helpful inside the gym and out always available to give advice on nutrition supplements and goes above and beyond to help you reach your goals will is great for anyone regardless of fitness level he will figure out a plan and exercises that work for you
2665,what negative thing can i say absolutely nothing we walked right in and was seated right away anthony was simply amazing he explained the menu very well and made us feel as family the apple old fashion was simply heavenly we had the steak and pork chop with twice baked potatoes the steak melted in your mouth and the pork chop was out of this world i can t say enough how awesome this place is we definitely will be back
2666,employees are great latte was amazing and had a design the avocado toast was super good
2667,would it be weird if i wanted to move in and permanently live here the style of this salon is impeccable the color palette and decor they chose makes it feel like you re in a restoration hardware magazine in france surrounded by heirloom antiques i didn t know what to expect when arriving but i was pleasantly surprised with their upscale polish options like chanel and many others i actually didn t know i needed in my life until i arrived service was prompt and i especially enjoyed the extended massage most importantly the tools she used were brand new had been sterilized i watched her open the fresh package up that made me feel good about cleanliness and safety i don t know if all nail salons have cute gold tips on their nail trimmer tools but now i want them for my own collection i picked a gray color for my toes and did opi funny bunny gel on my nails so far i m loving both so nice to see a high end nail salon finally making its way to nashville i ve gone to others in nashville that seem to be high end but it just ends up like a vip club on the vegas strip with loud music and sparkles just waiting for a justin bieber song to come on cured was not only high end but it was classic like the hamptons type of classic but with a comfortable low key brunch with girlfriends mimosa type of vibe i think it would be amazing for a bridal party with so many photo opportunities i felt comfortable with their prices competitive to anywhere else i ve gone in nashville worth mentioning i didn t know where to park so i parked on the side in a random parking lot looks like there s a lot of up and coming businesses beside them under construction so i m assuming once those are complete parking will be pretty straight forward when my mom sister come into town next i m going to take them here go to local honey for lunch since it s so close can t wait to go back welcome to the neighborhood
2668,visiting from out of town this bookstore was a small independent but had tons of variety of books for all children s area was super cute also had an adult spot to read books in the middle of the store with couches and a chess board regular prices also had cards postcards and nashville goodies
2669,this place is a lot of fun with cheap events and some really good headliners i ve always had a great time here
2670,they make all the ice cream in house and it s super good there is free water and tons of candy it s all nice and the employees are really polite you can go in sit down or walk off
2671,great food big portions my husband had the loco moco and i had the pancakes coffee and orange juice if you want breakfast or lunch this is the place to go
2672,i stayed here a few nights for work and have no complaints the front desk staff provided great recommendations for food and entertainment the room was large and clean with an ample amount of towels and pillows breakfast at the bistro is good if you re in a rush
2673,it is rare that i give bad reviews but this review in particular is for the super greasy and under cook boneless chicken like how do you serve under cook boneless wings smh this wings stop is the closest to my house so hopefully next time the service and food is better note to self stick with bone in please
2674,amazing this hotel is one of the best i ve ever been in you could live in here for a year and never leave they have everything
2675,use the yelp app to get on the waiting list we went on a saturday morning and it was very busy but the waiting list was cut down significantly by using the app the menu is expansive a lot of options the cinnamon french toast was very good the traditional breakfast foods were on par with most breakfast joints but the extras on the menu can keep you busy for many visits trying new things the strawberry orange juice was excellent so i recommend trying it it was a little hot in the restaurant could have been cooled down a lot for a more comfortable experience the service was very good there were two places to pay at the counter which i thought was a nice way to speed up the leaving process
2676,my favorite place for healthy food downtown all the people working here are friendly and happy to see you at karma josie and steve love to interact with the customers and know a lot about living healthy my two favorites are the brainiac acai bowl and the cobb salad free wifi also get a gut shot for stomach issues love coming to this place thanks to all the great staff i will be a regular here as long as i live in the city parking on 3rd ave or the parking garage next door
2677,studying previous yelp reviews we decided to take the kids to hibachi and sushi this place did not disappoint the sushi was amazing and the hibachi was awesome the dessert of fried bananas and ice cream ended a great experience the service was great and attentive will definitely return for more
2678,my 11 year old son wanted to try curry so i took him here the restaurant is fairly nondescript in decor but pleasant it took a little longer than expected to get our orders in we had the regular chicken curry dish and their tomato soup my son and i are very capable of handling hot food so when we ordered i asked for the hottest they do and he asked medium the waiter told us we better scale each down a bit and i begrudgingly agreed when the food came it was good but the heat level was very disappointing frankly the medium hot wasn t hot at all the food was good nonetheless and we will return but will stick to our guns on heat level
2679,what a treat i was here for a business event it was a wine pairing with a 5 course dinner each course was amazing wines were also top notch paraphrasing as i don t drink alcohol the sommelier at this establishment was amazing and explained all about each wine that was served with the dinner for sure a treat of the highest kind
2680,it s become the place you go to before a game in south philly i have always had a good experience here crab fries are a staple lobster white pizza is always great mussels in white garlic sauce yes please i will take all the bread you can give me to eat this delicious broth my favorite of all time at chickie s is the mcgooby sandwich a great roll with chopped onion and pickle they then top that with steamed and peeled shrimp on top of that goes some crab fries and on top of that goes the patented chickie s cheese sauce it is a great balance of cold and hot in a seafood sandwich can it complete with the lobster rolls of new england maybe i would like to think so my service has always been great here and there are always beer specials to be had
2681,chill bar perfect for a quiet monday night sidecar was great and chips with salt and pepper the perfect foil for a sweet drink wish we d discovered it earlier in our trip
2682,i tried this place on a saturday afternoon around 3 p m not busy at all and plenty of seating i had chicken wings syberg s original sauce and a side of fries with a beer to wash it down all together not a bad experience and the food was decent try this place out if you re in the area
2683,second time eating here always enjoy the brussell sprouts and hot cauliflower tuna tostada very good fusion of flavors kale salad for our greens and great flan for dessert a nashville favorite for us
2684,super cute southern vibes the crystal chandeliers are my favorite try the smoked pork sandwich and an italian mule cheers
2685,this is my favorite coffee shop so cute and great atmosphere i d definitely recommend you check this place out the lavender latte is amazing by the way
2686,we honestly found this place on a whim but my goodness was the food delicious and the service warm my wife had the fried catfish and i had the fried chicken with sweet potato pictured they were crusted in cornmeal which has a unique crunch and is very helpful for people with gluten allergies and coated in a delicious spice blend the prices were reasonable and every employee we met was awesome we ll definitely be back soon
2687,salty s has both great food and a great location after walking by several times we finally decided to stop for dinner we tried the macadamia nut crusted grouper and shrimp scampi both were delicious and we will certainly visit again
2688,the wissahickon trail i have been visiting for about 50 years now i was first taking down there to feed the ducks at valley green with my grandfather and later on that day we fished for bluegill while eating popcorn and drinking out of our thermos after all these years i still never get tired taking my children down to the creek and feed the ducks children while absorbine the breathtaking scenery which surround you i still take time out to get my fishing in along with my best friend and wife and my children visit the wissahickon valley trail any place you can and start your own memories they surely will last a lifetime
2689,leslie is outstanding a colleague recommended her to me over a year ago and we ve never looked back we d tried a couple other services in the past but never quite found the right fit brooms n buckets is professional thorough wonderfully friendly and everything i d been looking for
2690,this is my new favorite nail salon they have a huge selection of gel and dip powder and amazing acrylic work my technician shaped and shaped my acrylic nails until they were perfect going out of his was to make sure each nail was perfectly aligned and even my nails were weak and short coming in and he worked with them amazingly and i will definitely be back please visit this perfect nail salon when you need acrylics or dip powder done
2691,live in nashville and walked by americano for years without stopping in do yourself a favor and don t pass it by paella was fantastic worth the wait 5 margaritas on par with the 12 ones on 12th south our server david was a true professional and just the right amount of friendly we celebrated our anniversary will be back for a birthday
2692,so giving so loving so welcoming can ya ll move to cali love them tip them they deserve it
2693,amazing food and customer service the fresa aguas fresca was the best i ve ever had definitely the best mexican food spot in town
2694,this place was right near where i was staying and it had been over a decade since i d had a vegan cheesesteak in philly rip giannas so i was really ready to enjoy this sad to say i just didn t like it the sauce tasted strange to me as did the steak which reminded me more of veggie beef noodles in a vegan chinese food dish rather than a vegan cheesesteak i couldn t finish more than half and i m not known for leaving vegan junk food on a plate obviously different strokes for different folks some people in comments here seem to love it and say it s the best in the city and maybe their method of making this is more refined or something but in my opinion it just tasted gross and unappetizing mini desert hubcap was ok some little chocolate peanut butter thing nothing special the best thing by far was the waterade watermelon lemonade
2695,update it s rare that i solicit attention for businesses but one business i frequent is wildly deserving of attention i have been a client of lash therapy express hair bar and spa since 2012 and if i had a dollar for every time someone has asked for a referral since then i could retire i don t wear much makeup so having eyelash extensions that make me feel glamorous without having to do anything is a dream they re unnoticeable and easy to maintain as a cherry on the sundae the owners jayme and jarad are the most kind generous people you could find and their marriage is the definition of goals i bet that half of their business comes from fixing other lash places mistakes they train all technicians personally so you truly can t go wrong with whomever you book a quick trip to lash therapy is nothing short of therapeutic obviously i highly recommend them and if you ve ever considered such an indulgence i can assure you won t be disappointed thanks jayme and jarad for all you do you re loved
2696,if you want one on one therapy with therapists who really want you to succeed then come here i know some other therapy places write a program and allow you to be independent once you re familiar with the exercises and will periodically check on you but not here i wish i could have stayed longer but i it wasn t necessary
2697,i can t say enough nice things about the monaco we plan events all over the country and this is hands down the best hotel we ve ever worked with the staff is amazing they are incredibly friendly without being pushy we had a few last minute requests and the staff immediately jumped in to help us find solutions what i loved was that anyone you talked to would help they never said let me transfer you to catering or i don t handle that i ll have to find someone from av the facility was in a perfect location and the staff really pays attention to details housekeeping goes above and beyond special thanks to amber ingrid and chris highly recommend
2698,i love their breakfast salad never had anything like it interesting environment wouldn t go for a nice breakfast but good casual bite
2699,we got the black and blue and the memphis stax absolutely fantastic super authentic st louis deli close to the brewery i would come here again
2700,pretty setting easy parking and delicious food had french toast and spicy sausage guest had eggs benedict great coffee and real cream love the outdoor seating is covered with ceiling fans inside is very nice full bar personable service will definitely go again
2701,new juice bar on north west side of town easy to get to and lots of parking easy walking from the nearby northwest hospital if you need to get out for something we went on a saturday morning and it was empty that may change as people learn of this locally owned business clean and light music playing no outdoor seating yet and inside there are 3 or 4 tables for two so assume this is more of a to go place i got the tropical tai ango presentation was not as fancy as some high end juice bars and there was a lot of coconut shavings on it more than i would have normally preferred but the taste was good will need to try another bowl they offer smoothies bowls and juices and in the morning some oatmeal offerings
2702,love this place the owner and staff are friendly and fun and the food is excellent i m from california but visit meridian often and i m definitely going to be back
2703,ty came and switched out all of our locks he was on time friendly and was even friendly to our dog locks work great and we feel much safer now highly recommend them
2704,jennifer was amazing she helped us find what we needed and made us feel welcome what a lovely store would recommend
2705,we ve taken a few cars here over the last couple years and will continue to do so the service is great prices are reasonable and the staff is great we have tried the local car dealerships for a variety of services and consistently we had been disappointed and decided to try firestone and we are happy that we did
2706,although this location is small and could use to be expanded i love it here the staff is friendly and the store is always clean and organized this is the closest tj to me and i always make a point to stop here when i can my only wish is that they would be able to carry alcohol
2707,came for lunch the other day and i had such a good experience at red owl tavern the bartender was awesome
2708,i am new to st louis and with my daughter made our maiden voyage into the fountain tonight amazing atmosphere where we were welcomed right away and over indulged in a dessert appropriately named dark and sinister i have eaten all over the world and i am ecstatic that this establishment is so close to my new home i can t wait to enjoy all that the fountain menu has to offer can t wait to go back i am going to need a better workout routine
2709,awesome had the baked penne and meatballs fantastic perfect size portion meatballs were cut into slices
2710,i have been going to scott dentistry for 2 years now excellent dentist i noticed that they had started providing a new service for teeth whitening a 40 hydrogen peroxide i had used the bleaching trays that they sell with fare results but i wanted something more powerful i get my teeth cleaned every 3 months so i scheduled this whitening a couple days after a teeth cleaning i wanted maximum results when i arrived at my appointment there was some paperwork to fill out most describing the procedure and what the expectations of undergoing the procedure which i really liked because depending on the condition of your teeth the whitening could work or wouldn t i was taken back by mandy and was again described in detail of how the procedure was to be performed she compared my teeth on a color wheel and gave an expectation of what the whitening would do she was very articulate in letting me know what she was doing and what she needed me to do i was able to do three treatments of the whitening during my appointment mandy notified me at the start of the side effects of the whitening shocking feeling in my teeth which i didn t start to feel until the end of the third treatment mandy told me they would go away in one to two days but mine subsided after 8 hours and using fluoride toothpaste after the treatment was over we compared my teeth on the color wheel and my teeth had whitened a shade whiter i couldn t have been happier later that night i was at my nephews christmas concert and we were standing in the dark and my mom says boy your teeth are so white exactly what i was looking for totally worth the time and money it now has been three weeks since the whitening and my fianc still makes comments how white my teeth are
2711,i always enjoy coming here the ambiance is great the food is decent and it just has a different vibe
2712,i do not recommend going for lunch place is super small and you sit on top of your neighbors duck fat fries are delicious went for dinner multiple times and always had a good meal didn t get a burger went for lunch and got a burger and wasn t a fan waitress was on the ruder side and messed up my order and didn t seem apologetic
2713,mi ranchito is that typical authentic mexican restaurant and it is delicious the cheese dip is perfect and the salsa is not too hot margaritas are bomb overall i highly recommend this place
2714,3 25 pretty good overall food service menu s mores sundae 3 25 pretty good frozen custard although wisconsin is still my gold standard,3 75 good selection of high end gourmet food beverages definitely a must stop for fellow foodies however if you re just looking for staples than a conventional grocery store will be more economical lol
2715,mon ami et moi avons fait le tour du quartier treme aujourd hui notre guide lawson tait excellent compltement bilingue pleine de connaissances sur l histoire crole du 17me sicle au prsent lawson est trs aimable et prt rpondre aux questions sa perspicacit quant aux liens entre la culture crole africaine et amricaine tait fascinante on n a pas fait d autres visites guides pendant notre sjour mais je suis tout fait content d avoir choisi celle ci je vous le recommande sans hsitation merci

2717,redfish fajitas ceviche chicken shrimp fajitas were all really good small restaurant with tight seating does have outside seating as well and not much parking food was all fresh and delicious only problem was we had a new waiter who didn t know the ropes yet so we received our appetizer at the same time as our main course well actually actually we never received the queso dip because waiter didn t know he was supposed to go fix that himself yikes refill on drinks were slow coming as well but overall the fresh well prepared food means we will try it again
2718,paul is the local custom furniture maker i have been looking for i wanted a custom spice rack made for my tiny philly row home to better maximize the limited cabinet space in my kitchen he brought my design idea to life while working within my budget he was very easy to work with in fact paul finished the project ahead of schedule and even installed my piece when he dropped it off for delivery i have plans for many more custom pieces by south philly barn in the future
2719,as i write this my stomach is full not the sick kind of full either good full after a twenty minute ordeal of i don t know what i want to eat my husband and i decided impulsively on tomo we were pleasantly surprised the atmosphere is cozy modern and cultural the crowd was very diverse excited and overall had such a good vibe the staff was amazing so friendly and great with our toddler they had highchairs and she was obsessed with the rice my husband ordered the hibachi dinner with filet and chicken i opted for the spider roll and california roll the hibachi is an affordable option if you re in the mood for perfectly cooked meat veggies and fried rice the show the chef put on was hilarious and very interactive basically the whole experience left my husband raving saying we will never go to benihana again and he can t wait to go back
2720,service is wonderful i have celiac disease and have always felt safe here servers are careful to answer questions and got excited with me about fried chicken it s so nice to have meals in public beyond a salad hold the croutons
2721,i had the clam chowder and lobster tacos picture and my boyfriend had the lobster pasta the food was really good and the guy behind the bar the one that looks like shawn from boy meets world was really nice and you can see how hard the chef and cooks work a it s a long wait during prime time but that s what you get for going during prime time
2722,don t get your hopes up on a slice of specialty pizza even though it s on their menu they can t make it and will offer you to purchase all the toppings on a cheese slice of pizza so we ordered a cheese slice and it s been 20 mins and it has not come out yet and still waiting waitress is not attentive to the table and cares more about gossiping with co workers and twirling her hair overheard her complaining about a tip she received from a customer as we finally received our food i have changed my 2 start review to a 3 star based on the food quality food over all is pretty tasty i wouldn t recommend the cheese slice but the stromboli was delicious
2723,one of my favorite places in town taco tuesday is a must here let s not forget the salsa bar is well stocked and delicious you definitely need to try this place if you haven t already
2724,great experience of new orleans on a real steamboat if you re hungry the lunch with a live jazz band is pretty decent very friendly staff
2725,was in town visiting a friend so the location was perfect room was available early after a red eye which was amazing bar staff is very attentive didn t eat but the menu was inviting fitness center is surprisingly good well appointed if you re looking to get in a workout all day coffee is a nice touch as is the water bottle refill station room is clean spacious comfortable what you would expect of four points if i m in the area again i would certainly stay here again
2726,great service and body work looked great they even vacuumed the inside randy kept me up to date on the status through text so i knew what was going on with my car at all times
2727,i have groen up eating italian food and i have not come across a more legit place than mazzaros love their sauce and meatballs
2728,my cousin therese treated me here for a pedi last june 2016 mary did a great job i will continue to come back again
2729,best burger i ve had in a long time loved it fries were great too went with 5 friends and everyone loved their food chicken cordon blue sliders ginger chicken lettuce wrap grilled romaine all of it friendly wait staff and good drinks
2730,outstanding dozen oysters were 9 and they serve them with a large bowl of cocktail sauce with horseradish on the side so you can make it as hot mild as you like seafood gumbo was the best i have ever had service was prompt and continuous stop here on the way to the airport
2731,atmosphere is adorable 5 stars and location is outstanding 5 stars but since food is likely why you would venture to a restaurant they get an overall rating of 3 got a smoked turkey club and it was mostly good loved that it came with 2 sides the meat just wasn t awesome the creamed spinach was good but the mac n cheese was kind of dry and bland disappointing since it was an upcharge not giving up on this place yet i m determined to go back and try something else because i want to love it
2732,we have been twice now and the food is excellent as well as the service very interesting food combinations for your tacos comfortable atmosphere all around the best fresh gourmet authentic mexican food in the treasure valley highly recommend
2733,we were completely neurotic and had tons of questions and the saleslady was profoundly helpful and patient and her suggestions were knowledgeable and honorable these are good people they re trying to win your business for life not win your business for the day
2734,best fried chicken in the state if you don t like walt s chicken there is something wrong with your taste buds
2735,a coworker recommended this place i went with my wife for our dinner and we both got some kind of burger i myself was ok with the food but it was kind of pricey my wife didn t really like anything on the menu but then again we just went without looking at the menu so the restaurant is not to be blamed the service was great and so was the setting overall a pleasant experience
2736,you guys soooo good the vegan chickpea scramble is delicious as are the potatoes and the plain pancakes yum we will definitely be back
2737,this review is of a takeout order we ordered samosas lamb biryani chicken tikka dal and garlic naan food was just average most of the dishes were a bit too sweet the garlic naan was tasty won t really be ordering from here again or planning on dining in
2738,drive the park in your car great for mixed photographer non couples my husband is an amateur photographer likes to take his time setting up his shots i m point shoot done being able to drive around in our car pull over wait for him while listening to music taliesin orchestra s forbidden forest as the sun set sipping water is a comfortable way to support his hobby we came towards the end of the day to get sunset pictures november i hopped out to take some shots too gorgeous ones on my little canon iphone there may have been 3 other cars on the drive the entire time we were there stress free we spent about 2 hours at the park
2739,christian was so helpful funny polite and an all around great employee made our experience phenomenal and definitely will encourage us to choose eegees more often give this man a raise
2740,super quaint little place between downtown and the fairgrounds parking is super easy and free went today for brunch menu is limited but the bartenders hooked up to amazing drinks based off the things that we told him we liked will definitely be back,all the choices easy in out parking always fresh tastes amazing every time my favorite is the power bowl it s a must go
2741,this place is brand new and my first experience was really enjoyable the decorations set a good vibe its calm and cool in there some of the art on the wall is for sale too i was greeted by a cashier whose name i ve unfortunately forgotten but she was incredibly kind she recommended the green oasis smoothie and i took her advice i did tell her that i am dairy free and she said that wasnt a problem they just didn t add the yogurt they also have breakfast sandwiches pastries and pre made salads and sandwiches that will be great when i m in a hurry to get to work the green oasis smoothie was so delicious that i stuck my head back in the door to tell the woman who i assume was the owner that it was delicious entire staff was pleasant delicious first product and enjoyed the atmosphere i may become a regular
2742,we are here for the friends and family soft opening the menu was limited however the options were all very good austin and lauren were great behind the bar can t wait to come back
2743,over all a good year they need to bring back the early bird tickets though but it was nice having fewer people this year
2744,this place is a treat you can spend hours there easily here s how you do it get a group of friends who like to good wine good food and good conversation ask the staff for a couple of recommendations then sit back and let it happen
2745,great build your own pizzas and affordable prices choose from white wheat or gluten free thin crusts and then pile on the toppings build your own comes with your choice of cheese sauce and three toppings or choose from a menu of pre customized selections ingredients are super fresh and i loved the thin crust i ordered wheat crust a combo of shredded and fresh mozzarella red sauce spinach diced tomatoes and mushrooms so good i forgot to take a picture before it was all gone they also have a coke freestyle machine which is always fun to create drink combinations they also serve beer tapped and in the bottle as well as wine their salads looked good but i didn t try one this time i ll definitely be back and with all the options maybe try something different for variety,not a bad cheap place for lunch with many options their prices have recently gone up from 7 99 to 8 99 or at least that is what we were charged for lunch last week still for what you get that is still a fair price let me start by saying i don t typically eat many of the fried options on typical asian buffets but they have many healthy options if you choose wisely their sushi is not bad and the offer about 6 8 rolls during the lunch time and some other types of sushi items the salad bar is adjacent to the sushi bar with cold shrimp and a variety of fruit they also have hibachi here but it is not manned all the time so you will need to know to go to the back of the restaurant and wait for someone to assist you the hot items in the center of the restaurant range from kid friendly chicken fingers pizza and wings to your typical buffet items of fish fried foods baby clams rice dishes vegetables and soups they do have a small dessert section but also ice cream with about 8 flavors we have never eaten there for dinner but were there during the lunch dinner turnover last week and they had signs out letting you know basically if you paid for lunch this item is included only in dinner i thought that was kind of cheesy as i ve never seen that at other buffets we ve been to honestly there weren t many new options for dinner that i saw and nothing that looked significantly different from what was available for lunch i also did not notice any crab legs but maybe they are only served on weekends i don t believe the price difference for dinner would be worth it here the place has been changed over a couple times from other restaurants it really needs updating and a decorator s touch but who knows maybe that s how they keep the price down
2746,a little over crowded but the drinks were fine i would recommend a different place but this one is fine
2747,great for food allergies the manager came to take our order to ensure that the kitchen knew she made specific suggestions and we we re thrilled with our meals definitely will be back
2748,great place for st louis style pizza the sauce has a slight sweetness that we like the cracker thin crust and cheese combination is delicious also we have got delivery twice and both times we were pleased overall nice option for a late night pizza order peace
2749,sophia has done it again she has had a place in bryn mawr for years the salon in bala cynwyd is a soothing place to go and get great work done with the heart spirit and action of true service clean attentive and thorough work this location also has her daughter trained and experienced in nyc doing complete hair services bravo p s my only wish is a bit more warm color and artwork the monochrome while stylish is a bit stark but the warmth exudes from sophia and her staff
2750,my girl lisa never disappoints staff is friendly and through they do their best to accommodate you quickly when they are busy i always book appointments and have 0 wait standard nail salon offerings
2751,knowledgeable tour guide and a really must do in nola avoid the summer months if possible oppressive heat and humidity only bearable if you re a local
2752,only have had drinks there as the menu looks like nothing special but the atmosphere is really cool to have a drink in it has a nice breeze and you can see the gulf from inside the bar,had lunch and drinks there while staying at the guy harvey the chicken fajita wrap was very good and my wifes steak tacos were very good but the atmosphere is really cool to have a drink in it was pricey like everything on the resort but friendly staff and quick service it has a nice breeze and you can see the gulf from inside
2753,it s nice that this location has a bunch of equipment but unfortunately the space is too small for everything plus the equipment is a bit dated everything appeared to be in decent shape but there are some cramped spots especially if trying to use the squat rack right by the dumbbells i was able to get a decent workout in while on the road but there are better anytime fitness locations out there,not a whole lot to say here the food is fantastic i haven t tried anything that i wouldn t devour again brisket pulled pork smoked wings yes please on all all the employees are extremely friendly service is fast and this is the best texas style bbq you will get in the tampa bay area if you want good bbq this is your place maybe next time i won t eat so much of the smoked meat that i can actually try one of the dessert offerings
2754,excellent fresh large portions true north indian vegetarian friendly and great service they supply complementary popadum as appetizer great garlic naan
2755,those who know good japanese food will leave this restaurant more than pleased we have frequented this establishment at minimum 4 times per month over the past 8 years we have never had one disappointment service is always on point sushi has always been fresh and of high quality and hibachi experiences a memory maker my kids love the chicken katsu miso soup and many other menu items our children always request tomo for their night out if you haven t tried this restaurant put it on the list of must try
2756,love love this salon my friend is the owner and she is one of the best nail tech i know she gets me right every time andeveryone here is so friendly and the vibe is really chill
2757,this is excellent vegan soul food with a menu that changes daily the bread pudding white beans and okra gumbo are all really special everybody is friendly and you can tell they live what they do
2758,great museum but beware both times we went my granddaughter got head lice i wrote them and not even a reply don t let your child wear any hats or costumes
2759,everything i had was amazing we ordered brisket plate with corn bread coleslaw mac and cheese and potato salad i don t usually like potato salad but this was really good mac and cheese was good but could use some more spices brisket was tender and easy to eat
2760,had a great experience today with my tech and carpet cleaning service donte arrived early and took his time setting up pre treating heavily soiled areas and worked his way from upstairs to downstairs i couldn t believe the results didn t have great expectations with the high traffic soiled areas and stairs but i was unexpectedly blown away my carpet looks gorgeous the nap is nice soft and fluffy i m amazed and impressed totally satisfied thanks coit and donte
2761,well worth the wait my mother and i went on a monday morning around 9am the wait was about 20 minutes we thought we were going to have to wait for hours but we were pleasantly surprised the line moved really fast for us our waitress michelle was incredibly welcoming and helpful she made our experience at the pancake pantry top notch please do yourself a favor and order the sweet potato pancakes and pair them with the cinnamon cream out of this world
2762,just had a spa pedicure with vicki she squeezed me in right away it was excellent and tailored for my needs my feet look so pretty now
2763,this suburban location has a more open and relaxed feel than the hustle and bustle of cafe du monde on decatur but still brings the same high quality and incredibly affordable prices of the og beignets these beignets will make you look and feel like a cocaine addict oh yeah you ll be back for more highly recommend
2764,beat meal i had this past week in new orleans was here wonderful ambiance food was delicious and for the most part service was outstanding
2765,good food good service and good prices the california steak burrito was pretty good i could ve used a little bit more steak inside the burrito the peppers inside were very fresh the cheese sauce on top was just the right amount the jumbo cadillac margarita was very tasty and didn t have too much ice which was nice we ordered tacos from the regular menu for the kids instead of the kids menu and that was a good move because they wouldn t have eaten the beans and rice from the taco on the kids menu
2766,excellent fast food that tastes like formal sit down quality food they prepared the jap chae top bop vegan the glass noodles were excellent nice portion presentation and service good wifi too nice bathrooms definitely visit i also like that they use sustainable cardboard food containers and wood sporks instead of plastic
2767,i m from out of state and my coworker and i stopped here to get our nails done the staff were very nice accommodating they were also very gentle i love this place and will definitely be coming back if i m in the area
2768,great service very accommodating love it strongly recommend the danny if you like hot if you like hot hot asl for some of the special sauces from hell s gate roll nice heat
2769,best sandwiches in st louis could eat here everyday always a very friendly crowd when i come and eat here
2770,would have been a 5 food was excellent ambiance is well designed hostess fit the cool vibe bartender seemed a bit bothered but drinks were nicely crafted when i was finally noticed great care went into making the cocktail but it floored me that the ice was the kind you get at the machine in 7 11 kudos to the chef though cant get this authenticity in ny and the value is incomparable
2771,great find the food and atmosphere was very homey and delicious the staff was amazing
2772,love this place in new orleans the gumbo is amazing with the crab legs the people are so nice located in treme and much better than the tourist spots
2773,i ll admit i messed up and tried to rent a car from another enterprise location and they didn t have a compact car ready for but they gave me an suv for a discounted rate with no hesitation then a few days later when i found out my car would take a week to be done i called to get a compact car due to money issues and they told me to keep the suv for the compact car rate can t beat that this enterprise location is so nice quick and accommodating when i m in need of a rental it s the only place i ll go
2774,this was my first time to milk and honey and it was fantastic the burnt sugar latte was fabulous i had the hot mess biscuit which was great others at the table had the fried chicken biscuit wild mushroom omelet and the farm house biscuit the environment was great and service was also excellent we arrived just before 9am on a a saturday and didn t have a wait but shortly after the restaurant got very busy
2775,well it was girl scout cookie inspired beer day and they did not disappoint i got the mint chocolate stout and s mores stout in a bottle while they lasted i proceeded to get myself a 12 oz chocolate peanut butter porter that i loved it was 7 the place was densely populated for the unveiling of the aforementioned girl scout beer i stayed at the bar and chatted up a random customer till my porter ran out i like the layout of the bar and the beer was amazing do yourself a favor and swing on by for a cold one
2776,just had brunch at reeds had a hard time choosing but ended up with the poached eggs with brown butter hollandaise charred scallion and mushrooms with focaccia toast did not go wrong hubby got chorizo omelet with smoked potatoes also delicious we had just coffeed up but the lattes and other coffee drinks around us were getting lots of ooos and ahhhs great atmosphere great food
2777,hotel with good amenities including an in house gym the front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful especially james free coffee in the lobby is a plus but there is no free breakfast to kick off the day on the other hand there is a small coffee stand with some food in the lobby as well as a sit down restaurant adjacent panera and mcdonalds are within 5 minutes walking distance the parthenon is across the street making for a really nice location by vanderbilt
2778,i had very good lunch here i will say my first impression wasn t great no one was in there except for one person at the far end of the counter on his phone no one came out to seat or greet me so i asked the guy at the counter if anyone was around he got up no said sure and got me a water and said sit anywhere after that all was good he was friendly took my order and was attentive the owner came back from running errands and was also friendly i got the beef ribs with house cut fries and mac n cheese the ribs come on the bone like literally sitting on top of the bones new experience for that but they were excellent it was a good size for lunch for dinner i d want like one more the fries were excellent i like fries to be crispy not burned these were crispy which was good for fresh cut fries the mac n cheese is homemade and uses different noodles some shells some penne and a couple others i liked the different bites and that there was a bit of crust from the cheese on top i don t like garlic and will say i thought i tasted some in it but i still ate and enjoyed it the inside is pretty neat looking and apparently the previous place had a bar i would definitely go back to try the other food and would absolutely get the beef ribs again
2779,best gluten free cupcakes ever so many frosting and filling options and the gluten free cake tastes the closest to a traditional cupcake i ve ever tasted both my daughter and i are gf and we can t say enough about how delicious these were and the woman working there was the sweetest
2780,i was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one i love the 96th street naked tchopstix so i was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house the vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area you order at the counter and they deliver it my daughter and i tried the sushi bowl you pick up a piece of paper and select from a choice of proteins vegetables rice and toppings i like the fact that it is on paper and you don t have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want the sushi bowl was good but not wonderful the choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and i felt i had more rice than other food items the sauces were tasty my husband ordered the maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard it was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street i would go back though and i think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls i do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service people it is a sushi place it isn t mcdonalds so it will be a bit slower you are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express as a healthy alternative to fast food in the area it is worth the wait oh and try the bubble tea i had the strawberry and it was quite yummy next time i am going to try the vanilla chai
2781,this place is great for trying something a little different but not too far off the beaten path you ll probably want to order multiple things off the menu the wait can long and no reservations but it s worth it it s a very welcoming atmosphere and even though it s always busy the service never feels rushed spend a lunch or brunch here with friends and you ll leave planning your return
2782,simple breakfast food that is simply delicious great little diner service was quick nice place to stop in and catch a quick meal,the food was typical of anything you d find at a chain restaurant which this is my burger was delicious all of my coworkers had the cajun pasta and loved it they also had bread pudding and loved it the entertainment was amazing service was great we really had a great evening here
2783,this place is great the crew are awesome makes for a more relaxed fishing experience
2784,food is always good just a little pricey it is a family owned business burgers are good when they have them most specials aren t that great salads good
2785,over the past 4 years cfz has become so much more than just a gym or box to me it has become a safe place for me a place where i can be myself without judgement a place that uplifts encourages and pushes me beyond all expectation ive gotten stronger both physically and mentally since joining i no longer fear the wods i can honestly say i go into each workout feeling like i can and will give my absolute personal best the encouragement that is given here is simply amazing the cfz coaches and athletes are my family they ve seen me at my worst and loved me even harder a few years ago i lost my dad unexpectedly and went on to go down a self destructive path that left me broken my family at cfz were there to pick me up stand beside me as i grieved accepted me without judgement and loved me when i couldn t love myself i don t think i could have made it out of that place without cfz
2786,came in for a big change hair do and got exactly what i wanted kudos to krisi who did a phenomenal job if you re going very short go to her for sure very pleased with her patience attitude and hair cutting skills will definitely come back also the vibe of this salon is super chill and not at all loud
2787,great place for a mid morning coffee mara is delightful and makes you feel like you belong here you re not just another customer a relaxed atmosphere where you can get some work done or have a good conversation with a friend looking forward to trying her bagel sandwich and quiche
2788,i don t come to best buy often but when i do it s usually a pretty intimidating experience because i have no understanding of electronics i walked in with a laptop that wouldn t charge and oliver and keone helped me identify the problem asap they didn t have a loose charger for a macbook pro so keone went out to his car to get his own for me to use an actual angel i was so blessed oliver basically talked me through a panic attack while i waited to find out if my laptop was gone for anyway they both hung out to see if the charger worked and it did i work in the restaurant industry so i m all about customer service and i d never had anything like this before i m so appreciative thank you oliver and keone for making my week
2789,on a recent trip to the ima i knew this was here but i thought it was going to be closed at the time we were there surprise surprise it was open and bustling after exploring the greenhouse and taking way too many pictures of pretty flowers we entered and got some drinks and snacks they had beers and a cider but i really just wanted the root beer they had and then also got pretzel and cheese to share the pretzel easily sharable for 3 or 4 people the pretzel was fresh the cheese was pretty much like pump cheese i expected something a little nicer but it was still good there was greenery and shade and places to sit pretty much an excellent place to take a rest at while exploring the grounds of newfields i still want to call it the ima
2790,the food was okay and the price was reasonable but the service was very rushed we were constantly asked to order quickly or if we were done that was a big minus rushing us to our food
2791,hands down the best shrimp and grits of life i wish i could visit new orleans more often just to eat here small little place good service better sauce than most places for the entrees
2792,the food was fairly average the waitstaff was inattentive but quick the sundae waffle was far from what was implied in the name and was prepared differently than the menu suggested and did not have enough fruit the cinnamon bun pancake at first bite was delicious but the more you eat it the more you realize it is subpar the filling was far too sticky and the pancake far too dense it was also overpriced for the quality of the food roughly 30 dollars for both of us 6 5 10 experience overall
2793,a treasure so glad we found this wonderful little spot for breakfast or lunch sweet casual decor excellent menu choices and specials attentive friendly staff no gluten free bread yet but they are hoping to add some when they find a good supplier they do have gf cookies in the meantime loved the cheesy grits everything that went by looked fabulous
2794,nico s is my favorite go to mexican spot always consistent and delicious make sure to get green and red salsas
2795,wow great new addition to broadway the venue is amazing ate at the rooftop lookout ordered almost half the menu between the five of us love the small plate concept got to try and share so much cocktails are fabulous prices are extremely reasonable especially for the quality service is spot on can t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu
2796,this is a gorgeous place to drive through hike or picnic but shame on you park service for charging 15 for a day it s actually a week pass but really we live local and like to take visitors but paying 15 for a day is ridiculous i mean come on most visitors drive through and even if you offered a 10 day pass and 15 wrk pass but 15 for a day is too much recently i was at a charity luncheon and a group of people locals started talking about this at least offer a day pass for locals with a tucson drivers license
2797,thank god for the rpo win or get a one star plus i ll come down there and kick everybody s ass except the defense hey eagles i haven t heard of anyone there in your organization using their money power and status in society talking to the white house shut down i m an honorably discharged marine veteran get in there and do something thanks super bowl champs
2798,unassuming low key place with a full bar and vietnamese fare the traditional pho was pretty good the rice vermicelli with grilled pork and egg roll was really yummy we also had the pork banh mi which was also tasty all in all a pretty good dinner choice best of all bill for 4 was 55 with no drinks
2799,absolutely loved everything we ordered we started with the bread board and it was delicious i ordered the bacon egg and cheese on a croissant they re croissants are to die for we ordered a few different coffees and they were great mimosa was average
2800,dr bartley is the most thorough chiropractor i have ever been to he is truly concerned with your well being and taking his time to properly adjust you i was in a bad accident several years ago and have gone through a handful of chiropractors and he is hands down the best one if you re looking for a chiropractor look no further im thankful to sealand and dr bartley for always being so accommodating also you will enjoy the hydro massage chairs heaven
2801,i heard a girl walk out of the bathroom and proclaim wow this might be the best bar i ve ever been too and i gotta say she s right great drinks friendly bartenders excellently thought out decor
2802,great spot smaller quaint but with a soulful feel not too loud even with live music all the food was delicious the steak was great but the tempura shrimp was where it s at smaller tapas type plates we had a wonderful time
2803,everything was phenomenal sasha was our waitress this evening she is warm and inviting the owner chris is also extremely nice and professional accommodations were made due to allergies and everything was overall perfect i highly highly recommend we will definitely be back for our 4th year anniversary thank you for a wonderful evening
2804,so i ll start with the positives the place is super clean which in the french quarter is kinda hard to come by and i love the decor and all the old photos i had the eggs pontchartrain and split the french toast with my husband both were really really good the manager olga was on top of her game and super pleasant now to the reason why i only gave 4 stars seems like they may be under staffed in the kitchen or maybe all the staff is new i m not sure we sat upstairs but not on the patio but the waitress seemed overwhelmed with the tables outside and we were sitting for nearly 15 20 minutes before she came to the table the manager got us our drinks and took our food order before the waitress ever made it to us even though she was told by the manager that she had another table our food didnt take extremely long but longer than i feel like it should have and there were others who complained about the wait for food being like 35 40 minutes i feel like its still a new place and still working out the kinks but my overall experience was good so if you can go knowing that and be understanding and patient its definitely a place to put on your list to try we will definitely be back
2805,the food is pretty good and i love eating in the restaurant it s a fun environment the parking lot it tough to maneuver epspecially if it s busy
2806,lunch time what else but some good bbq sonnys was excellent service was good and food came out quick ribs and bbq beans were amazing will definitely come back next time i am in plant city fl
2807,i love this place i use their drive thru most of the time it does take a few minutes to get the food but that s because as they have it posted it s not fast food their mexican food is great try the super fries yummy yummy my kids love them i usually have the chile verde burrito a lil spicy for some but perfect for me try it you ll love it
2808,we took a trip to new orleans for spring break my son s 11th birthday one of our excursions was the swamp tour our guide was capt troy please please please take this tour when i say it was awesome that is an understatement capt troy provided us with a wealth of information he was very patient and answered every question that was asked i am a swamp people the reality show fan and i learned stuff that was totally different than the show oh and we were on honey island how cool is that if you take a trip to the bayou make sure you book a swamp tour through cajun encounters you will not be disappointed from beginning to end
2809,an overall solid dining experience fresh seafood at reasonable prices compared to other places been there twice with parties of 6 and 4 and our guests were very satisfied all around
2810,the restaurant is beautiful and food is amazing i purchased red snapper bento box and it is a generous portion staff is very friendly
2811,don t let the small underwhelming building fool you this restaurant has delicious authentic italian food the service was excellent
2812,came here on a friday night there appears to be only one waitress so service was extremely slow she was also kinda rude it took almost an hour to get our food tasted very good though you can hear the gokarts next door
2813,went to the er today and the staff was attentive and lovely i have never been to a hospital for myself let alone the er and it was as lovely an experience as it could be
2814,i was pleasantly surprised with the service especially since our check was only 18 my brother got free sushi for his birthday and everyone was nice and attentive the quality is comparable to better than anything else in reno but the service really set them apart
2815,the cafe was extremely cute we came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time i got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious i loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside great price for a filling breakfast
2816,oh my gosh are these donuts amazing the cinnamon roll and cream filled fruit one completely rocked my world
2817,diverse and creative drink menu and excellently spiced dishes to live up to the name what i like best is how versatile this restaurant can be for the guest you can come in with a group and have a full and delicious meal or you pop in for a quick drink and snack at the bar either way you can t go wrong with any menu decision though i was a huge fan of the yogurt appetizer spice finch is a welcomed addition to the philly restaurant scene
2818,dr kaplan is smart knowledgable and very personable my wife and i have been coming here for two years the staff is very accommodating as well we have seen dr charles kaplan and np lana kessler and are very happy with both of them great practice highly recommend
2819,saturday evening at jesse s on a whim had to wait 3 hours for a tee time at a local indoor driving range so we went to jesse s our wait on a saturday evening was only about 15 minutes not bad for walking in and needing a table for 6 five of us ordered burgers and one had fish overall food was fair a might on the bland side french fries were decent but could tolerate being a bit more crispy drink specials were fair and the bartenders were honest with their pours overall no complaints server was pleasant and helpful once he remembered to get our order correct one of our orders had the wrong side dish the correction was quickly done should we be back in the area we will probably avail ourselves of jesse s again
2820,highly recommended miko did a great job with the inspection very attentive to detail and explained things effectively to my wife and i
2821,wife and i went on friday evening and ordered two gumbos when the gumbos arrived there was one piece of chicken and nothing else except soup it didn t even come with rice they brought us rice in a paper plate and it wasn t even enough for one of the gumbos so we asked for more the next day my wife wanted some beignets so we went for that only and informed them of our problem the night before and all we got was we will make sure to pass it on really no apology at all the beignets are delicious and frankly too good to pass up when in new orleans but as far as anything else on the menu i think we will find somewhere else to go
2822,get the roti canai here because it is freaking delicious with their flavorful curry chicken sauce it s basically the only thing i order for myself when i come here but i decided to try something new i got the asam laksa and wow it was super sour with a hint of spiciness it was not to my liking but i won t let that ruin my experience here i also got thai basil chicken and mee siam the thai basil shrimp was incredibly oily and it was sort of bland and i guess i ll have to blame the laksa for that but the mee siam was just perfect squeeze a little lemon over the noodles and dig in in my opinion it definitely pairs well with the roti canai the acidity from the mee siam cuts through the saltiness of their curry chicken sauce and coats your tongue which leaves you wanting more of each service was definitely not a problem as it was not busy and it was a great dinner
2823,the food is amazing here would highly recommend the chicken satay roti canai mee goreng noodles and beef rendang the only downside it is not byob while most other places in chinatown are the food doesn t always come out right on time but service is decent
2824,delicious crab dip and oysters super friendly service new restaurant with great outdoor patio on the water
2825,we love this place and have been going since they opened the prices have increased and the size of the dishes have decreased but the food remains fresh and delightful
2826,can t go wrong with cold stone however we arrived at 10 05 pm the open sign was on the hours clearly said closes at 10 30 and the doors were locked we waited a few minutes no one looked up from cleaning the place then a larger party came and they did finally come open the doors sorry ya didn t get to leave early kids
2827,decided to check out islands and wasn t disappointed the food was delish and the service was outstanding we did have to wait a bit but it wasn t bad they texted us to tell us our table was ready la cumbre needs more people friendly places while we waited we walked around and it was a ghost town sad compared to how it used to be
2828,drinks and staff awesome great place to stop and have a drink very friendly staff the sad thing is the food kinda kicks the formidable staff in the ankles the french onion soup is served like toilet water with melted cheese in it the delight of french onion soup is the toasted cheese kelly chooses to serve in deep dish cups not toasted and it is not a wise choice i doubt any french onion soup lover would like it cuban sandwich i was served with what clearly looked like french bread opposed to cuban bread the bread appeared fried on a regular grill and the texture of it was greasy not what anyone who grew up with cuban sandwiches would expect and a travesty for tourists the cut of the meat reminded of baloney not good
2829,pros the food is really good the burgers are tender and juicy and the chili is amazing the taste of the food alone will bring you back for more cons both times i have ordered from there it has taken forever the first time it took over 30 minutes and the second time i ordered i asked them how long it would take before i placed my order they said 15 minutes as they were finishing up a catering order i ordered at 11 55 and thought that they were slow the first time so i gave them a bit of extra time i arrived at 12 30 ish and while the entire restaurant was empty they had not started on my order i didn t walk out the door with my food until 12 55pm and not a soul walked in nor did the phone ring with any orders if you order buffalo wings make sure you ask for them mild as you might wind up with the scorcer like we did and they were too spicy to eat the haystack the first time i had them were amazing the second time they were very doughy and heavy with oil a small fry is really really small as well i also ordered a small chili and it was a tiny 4oz portion i didn t expect it to be that small but i will order again because the flavor was on point so if you want great food just make sure you have plenty of time and are not in a hurry
2830,for my first time there it was not a bad experience the philly was actually really delicious i was presently surprised it is actually close to a philly from back home my hot lemon pepper wings were also pretty good my only problem is that i called in my order and they told me 15 minutes i get there only to have to place my order all over again after i told them i placed an order they then called me and told me that my order was waiting for me rolls eyes how they missed that they made the exact same two orders is beyond my understanding i also asked for just flats both times and didn t get it the food was good minus the fries that were freshly made but cold when i got home in 5 minutes lol but the service was actually pretty terrible so prepare yourself for that part
2831,love the happy hour 5 white sangria here staff was very friendly and food came out in a decent time i would recommend the fire grilled wings my server suggested it and definitely hit the spot she was awesome will be back again
2832,we got lucky to get two seats at the bar right away we got there around 10 30am the place filled up very quickly before we got our food a crowd began to form and it looked like it became about 20 30 min wait the food was hot and delicious the juice was fresh squeezed and amazing the service was impeccable as well but remember we were at the bar this was perfect for a very short walk from the hotel
2833,truly enjoyed the food and atmosphere here so glad we re getting places like this in tampa
2834,first off the service was wonderful they were always checking on us and we didn t have to ask for our server to come i was excited to go to this place because everyone said that the ramen was good here and it did not fail my expectations i have tried three of the ramens on the menu and they were the best the first taste when i drank the broth made me finish the whole bowl i enjoyed everything about this place and wish it grows with more ramen to its menu
2835,i didn t get the hairdresser s name but i will absolutely come back one of my pet peeves when it comes to a haircut is when the hairdresser use thinning scissors or when the layers doesn t blend well together well it didn t happen here he listened to my request and my hair turned out fabulous and still thick haircut only cost me 35 which is average considering how thick and long my hair was
2836,probably the best chicken and grits ever created yes my date didn t eat shrimp so they made chicken and grits which melted in your mouth my stuffed pork chop was fantastic as was the dessert i wish i could remember the servers names because they were awesome as well great atmosphere and certainly a fun crowd to the hostess boom
2837,another of my must haves whenever i come home to see my family amazing i have not eaten anything here that i haven t throughly enjoyed the crawfish beignets are cheesy and spicy the stuffed poboy is rich and flavorful with lots of gravy the redfish and grits is something i still crave get there early because they get very busy very quickly i ve even waited in line for them to open parking is always a struggle but it s worth it
2838,we came here while visiting boise on a snowy day the kids had a blast and burned off tons of energy there are so many different activities they were busy for hours the only con i have is the music played was so loud and annoying a quieter viewing area would be perfect for parents who just want to sit and watch
2839,my husband and i come here often we love the food here it s always fresh and the service is great we highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi hibachi
2840,still a great experience worth going out of your way to try food is excellent supurb service they take great pride in their product and it shows at every level do not miss the incredible bakery
2841,thank you for opening your new restaurant in tucson now i don t have to drive all the way to scottsdale to eat your delicious food tasty food combined with good size portions and a fair price
2842,our waiter jonathan cupid made our experience of new orleans perfect regardless of the rainy weather outside jonathan was a ray of sunshine he shared his wonderful voice with us as well as his southern gentlemen hospitality by making recommendations for our stay thank you for a great experience a must go to kinda place
2843,ate here for lunch with a client and we loved it i had the shrimp touffe and the roasted chicken matzo ball soup my client had a sandwich and it was huge enough for two meals at least service was great and we had a pretty neat seat next to the kitchen which is surrounded with glass i d definitely recommend this spot
2844,a rare find of taiwanese restaurant out in reno i highly recommend this place if you enjoy taiwanese cuisine you will be surprised at how authentic the dishes are here business gets very good on weekends especially during ski season i would raise to 5 stars only if they can improve the decor a little more and the overall cleanliness otherwise this is a must stop in reno if you are a taiwanese or one who enjoys taiwanese food
2845,lilly s cafe is amazing the service is super warm and extremely fast and the food is delicious there s a great vegetarian menu and everyone should try the vegan egg rolls they have taro and they taste like little savory donuts
2846,great food and friendly staff wonderful decor inside made for an awesome experience
2847,good food and good service i had gator tails in louisiana with crawfish and have been craving them since well gators dockside def hit the spot and their shrimp appetizers were the best
2848,this is one of the best bakeries in philly with the best creme donuts in america the butter cake melts in your mouth i always enjoy stopping in and smelling the fresh baked goods just out of the oven
2849,quick and yummy chinese food the market looks sketchy but it s a diamond in the rough the staff is great and reasonable for a neighborhood market the panda artwork is the seller of the honest food and i will continue to order chinese here shrimp fried rice is good as well as the shrimp lo mein
2850,hemingway s was truly incredible we ate here last night while wandering through armature works and found ourselves two seats at the bar my husband and i both ordered the red sangria and that in itself was an experience i ended up having two of those while here and will get one every time i come back we weren t super hungry so we opted for the chicharrones and a side of the sweet plantains both were divine the staff was friendly and helpful and we talked with felicia the owner for a while looking forward to our next visit
2851,ted drewes is a must in st louis i have lived in the area for 12 years and i finally tried it tonight i am glad i did before moving the cashier was friendly they were pretty busy but got the order out rather quickly i ordered the dottie concrete and added oreos it was so good the custard had a great texture rich and creamy i want to visit again before moving
2852,this aldis is always clean friendly and shelves stocked the parking lot has plenty of parking the staff is good at opening additional lanes to keep the wait of the lines down always a good shopping experience
2853,very philly style brunch i tried the benedict egg and my friend tried the sandwich both taste great best benedict eggs ever i would say especially the chef handled great temperature and times to cook the egg one thing to improve is maybe to refine the sides a little bit like adding more options
2854,i went for lunch i looked at their menu and it has all the basic of middle easter food lunch specials are only from 12 2 which includes the entree and rice i ordered chicken tekka masala i was given more liquid than chicken i had 4 small pieces of chicken it s a rip off i prefer the hole in the wall on broadway name mt something it s nepalese and middle easter more variety on lunch specials lunch special hours longer hours and you get naan bread you don t have to order and pay separate i guess we all have our preferences
2855,i almost don t want to rate this restaurant 5 star only because i m selfish and want to keep this place under the radar i ve not had one thing on the menu that wasn t delicious and i ve eaten here at least 6 8 times in the last 3 weeks steaks are delicious and if you like pasta try the tuscan gravy w homemade fettuccine if you ve had breakfast at their beach location you find some of the same items but some prepared differently from the beach spot i had the sausage gravy and biscuit it was probably the best i have ever eaten my companion ordered the lox eggs benedict and loved them happy hour 2 6 everyday with drink and app specials i love the thai chicken flatbread there is outdoor seating and two indoor dining areas great ambiance and the service is quite good as well the drinks are generous and delicious parking can be a bit tricky nut go around the corner and there s parking behind and a back entrance enjoy and i might see you there
2856,took over as our catering company for our office of over 500 office ppl and everyone loves them and we are picky we fired the last catering company and their food was not bad daily dish has excellent food sauted veggies perfectly cooked whole potatoes high end restaurant quality big portion entrees fair price and nice staff highly recommend
2857,the burger is the best breaky burger i ve ever had highly recommend and also tried the grilled cheese and bacon also a 10 out of 10
2858,first time here it was close to work went with my mom and my aunt we loved it very much definitely recommend this place we will be back for more sandwiches so good,first time we have ever been there we are from south florida and we re visiting the decor of gators is awesome the staff was really nice the food was good
2859,visual arts collective is my favorite place to see a show it s a place that supports and promotes culture it s versatile with rotating theater music and art the staff is friendly and the drinks are delicious they showcase local artists with an ever changing repertoire of art beautiful stage and relaxing authentic atmosphere the stage has an intimate feel to it it s a garden city gem that s a perfect date night go to has convenient spacious parking lot
2860,we were here drunk as all heck after closing time our guys at larry s hooked us up with leftover cheesesteaks and a meatball not only was this the best drunk experience of our young lives but we owe our lives to the workers at larry s god bless you have our business for life thank you and god bless
2861,i m pretty fussy when it comes to italian pizza sandwiches takeout but i have to give five stars to vano s because i believe it s the best in the area the cheesesteaks have plenty of beef and the large size could supply most people with two meals quite the bargain the steaks actually have beef flavor something lacking from any kind of beef these days imho my favorite though is the sausage onions peppers cheese sauce sandwich there s so much tasty italian sausage in there that it s almost impossible to close it it s actually my favorite sandwich anywhere i haven t been a pizza fan for many years partially due to a desire to cut down on starch and four slices of pizza has a lot more than a steak hoagie roll nonetheless circumstances forced me to take out a small at vano s and i have to say it was the best i ve had in at least a decade i nuked a couple of slices briefly to warm them up and everything melted melded together perfectly the crust was nice and thin not doughy or bread like not melba toast either sauce also excellent plenty of cheese and likely the only place left on earth that puts chunks of sausage on the pie instead of those tiny crumbs or slices so thin you can see through them the other half of the pizza had pepperoni and there was a substantial amount of that classic topping as well the only thing i would change here is adding delivery service but it s well worth the trip for dine in or take out
2862,i think this is the most underrated restaurant in nashville genuinely the best steaks ever and their steak burger is ridiculous also the wedge salad is incredible as is the potatoes au gratin i ve been countless times and have never had anything bad they are consistently good sure it s not a cool new or hip restaurant but it s so freakin delicious
2863,when you actually look forward to the day you have your dental appointment you know you have a great dentist thanks for keeping my smile perfect dayley dental
2864,i needed to get a key made and new garden hose i know the store layout well they have everything if you don t go on the weekend the evenings are good for parking and getting in and out quickly with what you need you could browse and find anything you want or didn t know you wanted
2865,we went here for a quick dinner and we were pleasantly surprised we ve eaten many times at the top deck restaurant but this was the first time we tried the steak and pasta house the place is very nice and clean and we were greeted right away by our server diana she was very friendly we ordered steaks with baked potato and we also head the escargot appetizer which was an incredible 5 95 they were fantastic our food was prompt and hot and the service was spot on we were out the door after less than 45 and stuffed to the gills my only tip is that when you order your meat their medium is what i would consider medium rare just be advised great food great service and we will definitely be back
2866,the food is excellent but the margaritas leave something to be desired i would absolutely come here again for lunch or for a dos equis but i would try someplace else for a stellar marg we have the enchiladas verdes and pollo y chorizo con queso and they were some of the best in town prices were excellent too
2867,awesome service awesome breadsticks awesome pizza and definitely some amazing craft beer highly recommend this to any local or tourists in the area i m a regular here and love the place all the staff are friendly and on point
2868,vick is awesome and really down to earth he s got great talent and is also super fast he ll do whatever you want i only wish they had the sns dipping powder
2869,fantastic dishes all around we order same items to create our own buffet at home and we are never disappointed the mongolian beef was very very heavy on the onions and not as heavy on the beef but we could easily corrected next time by asking for light onion the general tso chicken szechwan dumplings and pork fried rice are incredible we come from chicago to visit family in indiana and this is a must order while we are in town
2870,the food service and management here are phenomenal it s very nice to see a manager actually managing and directing opposed to just standing around the managers here also know how to handle a customers complaint properly and respectfully this is the reason i gave five stars even though there was an issue with my visit i came in for a late lunch on sunday and sat at the bar i was immediately greeted by a friendly bartender candy and order a fried grouper sandwich with fires and coleslaw the food came out very fast and everything was delicious the grouper filet was huge breaded properly and not greasy the fries were seasoned crisp and fresh the only complaint i had was a sticker being on some produce in the coleslaw at least you know it s homemade i brought this to candy s attention and she immediately corrected the issue by notifying a manager i was blow away at the level of service i received it s a rarity and i appreciate it besides that little hiccup i was very pleased with my meal and would recommend this location to anyone the beer is priced very well and the food is excellent the quality and service here is also better than the dunedin location in my opinion i ll be coming here more often
2871,got a great cut from victor a short wait good conversation between the staff and clients a nice big shop will definitely be back when in the area
2872,this is imho the best vietnamese restaurant in town its authentic and the food is good highly recommended
2873,nice place good beer lots of very good food drawback always very busy with a wait worth it yes come early and enjoy
2874,is a great place to get a great organic smoothie but my last time i was there they had music playing that had a lot of f bombs in it sadly as a father of young children i will not be returning there
2875,this is one of my favorite places for breakfast and lunch my only complaint is they re not open for dinner because i would go then too great food great prices great staff what more could you want the only thing to remember is that they only take cash
2876,i always enjoy shopping at this kroger store everyone is always friendly and helpful and most always go the extra mile tina and lisa are 2 of my favorites but i don t remember the others who have been so kind today i had a lovely experience at the customer service area and i appreciate their kindness wish i had their names
2877,st cecilia is a lovely intimate space with excellent food and great service they also make a good sazerac which i ve learned is mandatory to be considered fine dining in nola our party of two had two appetizers grilled oysters and confit wings both were great for our entree we split the gnocchi which was about as good as gnocchi gets and the reason you should visit st cecilia we drank our dessert sazerac again and went on our merry way feeling pleasantly mellow and satisfied
2878,selection of lassi here are great definitely recommend the fig
2879,this was my first time visiting the new dental office because of our insurance this office has great customer service i m always nervous when going to see the dentist and the staff and dr made my visit very comfortable i highly recommend if you are new to the area or need a new dentist i suggest this office thank you again for making my visit very comfortable
2880,stopped by last night for a quick bite the place was packed did not have reservations i would recommend having them if you are more than 2 people the air condition was very cold my wife asked if something could be done a few minutes later a young man came over and closed the vents near us that s good customer service thanks tori the prime rib eggs rolls and cheese board were very good i like the way they opened up the wall between the bar and restaurant the bathrooms renovations were also well done and clean we will be back
2881,it is delicious number one all man you have to come in sit down and dine in because you just might want to order more that s how good it is you got buber eat coming in and out people ordering left and right is so much food coming out of this place it s delicious that s why i was one of the world s greatest restaurant
2882,delicious pizza the crust was excellent and truly authentic we also had the tortellini with blush sauce the sauce was a perfect balance of cream and tomato great neighborhood spot
2883,what a great find happened on this place while visiting tampa because we figured there would be good eats near a mall and my son wanted mexican i m not a big fan of the usual americanized fare but reluctantly agreed to try this rather than its better known neighbors all i can say is that everything was perfect the food was fresh and delicious and prepared beautifully the table side guac is prepared to your taste our server andrea helped us with our choices and was attentive throughout the meal manager andres checked on us and gave us a quick history of the place as we left we told strangers walking past how good it was and convinced them to try it it s not in my hometown so i don t have to keep it a secret
2884,caution if you go here once you ll return over and over and over fat kids rejoice awesome cinnamon rolls other treats as well just do it you ll fall in love
2885,stylish and friendly salon i was recently in south philly visiting my sister from out of state and decided to give them a try for a cut after learning they specialized in curly and wavy hair textures i got a fantastic cut from rebecca that i love more every day my sister has proclaimed it my best ever cut i was able to make a last minute appointment the day before and they take walk ins so don t hesitate if you re feeling spontaneous
2886,friend suggested i try this place out so i drove like 25 miles this place is a hidden gem i went with the special for the night salmon and clams perfect you can bring a date here they will be impressed
2887,i was on vacation last week and my wallet fell out in there when i retraced my steps the bartender younger girl said i m so happy you came back my wallet was kept safe and nothing missing i didn t catch her name but i am very grateful for her
2888,i wanted to write a review today because of colin in the meat department this guy knew his stuff i was one of those annoying customers asking the difference between farm salmon ocean salmon organic etc and he patiently talked to me about all of the above plus more super helpful he also helped instruct me on how to cook the fish on the grill vs oven in regard to the rest of the store it was clean and well stocked very nice grocery store
2889,i really like this place it definitely doesn t look like much from the outside and they definitely have an odd assortment of food items on the menu chinese and american food but anytime i am craving slightly salty and delicious fried rice this is my go to spot there is just something about their fried rice that is above any other take out chinese food their buffalo wings are pretty good too i like that the sauce doesn t have as much vinegar as other places it s also a good place to go if you re craving two different types of food that are not even related to each other i mean you can order a combo with a philly cheesesteak and pork fried rice
2890,went saturday to golf at elrio we haven t golfed there due to high costs we were pleasantly surprised at the friendliness of the entire staff there was a tournament going on and even though we had not participated we were invited to pay a nominal price and enjoy the prime rib dinner offered the players in the tournament to our surprise the entire meal was very good and appreciate the thoughtfulness of the manager robert we plan on joining the next tournament and enjoying the fine food served at el rio golf course
2891,well i must say this pizza hut is looking better inside we go for the lunch buffet delivery the other night was on time and the whole order was correct keep up the good work
2892,basically if you want to buy some cupcakes to go pretty good spot 5 stars but pretty pricey for a to go activity if you want to sit down and eat a cupcake with one other adult friend also a 5 star activity but worth the money b c of the cute shop and experience with that said my experience bringing children 1 star there is no part of this place that is kid friendly and i don t have kids just nieces and nephews so that doesn t usually bother me but i wanted to bring my nieces here for their birthdays and only realized once i got here that it was a terrible idea which sucked b c i don t really know too many adults who want to sit down and share a cupcake in a cupcake store children can t see the high display of cupcakes unless you pick them up because of our group three adults two babies and a four year old there was only one part of the shop that we could all fit bar chairs and tables can t sit on and hold a baby at the same time the four year old needed help getting up and down off of the chair and constant vigilance b c a fall off of the bar stool would ve been a disaster the four year old was also thirsty and infused water is cute for adults but kids think it s disgusting the paper dixie cups don t hold enough water even for the four year old and not having a top on them sometimes ends in wet situations luckily not this day then there wasn t anymore water and you can t eat a cupcake when your mouth is dry meltdown so sorry to the workers and other patrons for that my sis and i had to inhale the cupcakes and we took the kids cupcakes to go i m not giving up on this place but rearranging the shop a little to have more seating for groups larger than two and closer to the ground making sure there s water easily available with cups larger than shot glasses and figuring out a better way to display the goods for all sizes of people would ve made our experience really enjoyable rather than resulting in the kind of story i tell my boyfriend when he talks about wanting kids previous experience 5 stars i went here 15min before closing so naturally i figured i was going to get a dried out crusty cupcake because it was the end of the day nope i didn t ask when they made it but it was super moist and delicious and exactly what i wanted at the time great service great selection i left very happy
2893,cute small friendly cafe delicious breakfast sandwiches the quiche was great everything tastes homemade lots of coffee choices yummy cappuccino
2894,came here march 3 2018 waited at a different one originally it s a chain but ended up here as the line was shorter and moving a bit faster there also might have been more seating options it s in the quaint musical legends park with statues and live music got the large coffee and beignets of course both were just ok large was kinda small and the beignets were a bit denser than the other ones in the area went to 2 other places for a comparison also had a taste of the jambalaya a bit spicy so so the coffee cup had a really cute design
2895,honestly probably the best tap rooms in tucson it s so sleek the decor is awesome the beers are on point i will be back and i ll tell all my friends
2896,wanted a rooftop experience with drinks by the bar but the bar was so crowded had to sit down for dinner dinner is great but be aware they only sit you down if you and your party are going to order dinner and more you are not allowed to have appetizers we ordered the salmon and the steak both expensive but worth it the steak was so juicy and just fell apart a knife wasn t even needed the salmon was cooked to perfection and the sauce that it was glazed in was just right ordered the lemon cheesecake which is served in such a beautiful way not your ordinary slice of cheesecake the drinks are strong and are made with quality dress up and treat yourself
2897,it is so refreshing to find a restaurant that serves paleo gluten free whole30 and keto foods while we can normally find a way to make a regular menu work for us it s nice to find a menu that really does work without modifications the shot of olive oil is a nice touch the wait staff are more than happy to discuss the food and assist with any questions great restaurant looking forward to my next visit
2898,the nutella filled meringues were absolutely divine i will be dreaming of them forever
2899,great food service was super nice george crab cakes were awesome just a great place to eat
2900,this is a historic hotel in the french quarter my wife and i have stayed her multiple times and always enjoy it the roof top pool is great and the carousel lounge in the lobby is amazing the cost is reasonable for a stay here and the staff is very attentive if you don t stay here for some reason at least walk in and give it a look very classy hotel steeped in history
2901,dude i cannot believe we finally have a legit greek restaurant in nashville and they have heineken on draft like seriously two of my favorite things the tzatziki sauce was everything it should be rich garlicky and not watered down so freaking delicious the fries were savory my salad was delicious and fresh my husbands lamb was awesome but omg draft heineken i m half dutch and haven t found one place in nashville with draft heineken drinking it out of the bottle is just not the same this place is a win win win cheap and absolutely fantastic yay we will be back again and again
2902,delish meatball smash southern benny coconut cream pie the best we ve had in a long time excellent wait service all around from orderer to server would have rated 5 stars except for loud music couldn t talk to each other without shouting across table for only 2 of us glad we made reservations tho it took us a long time to get one since restaurant was written up in newspaper
2903,i love it here the pizza is fantastic and the staff is very friendly it s a great place to hang out with friends and family
2904,the food was amazing and the service was great i would recommend this restaurant to anybody i am a very picky eater especially when i m out i m big one service i m big on good food so it s a big deal when i walk into a restaurant and don t have 1 complaint from the time i walk in the door from the time i walk out the door and the prices were not bed
2905,just moved to the area and was really excited to try a new restaurant masami did not disappoint the hibachi was delicious i always use a basic sushi roll as a measuring stick to decide whether or not the sushi is fresh good and the philadelphia roll was 2 thumbs up i would ve rated my experience a 5 but i felt like the hibachi chef could ve been better he had a dull personality compared to most i will definitely be back
2906,this place is hands down the best sushi in town it is not your typical sushi place where you will see people pounding back sake and sapporo and eating rainbow rolls and edamame the fish is so fresh the brothers know what they are doing so when you come here trust in them and let them take your tastebuds on a ride the whiskey aged soy tuna was so good we ordered it 3 times all the rolls have such different flavors that melt away in your mouth no soy sauce is needed for anything the fish is always so smooth and buttery that you never feel full you just keep wanting more also yes there is sake and nothing goes better than great tasting sushi and sake can t wait to go back for more,mazzaros market is fat kid heaven when you walk inside through the arch you begin to smell the baked goods and coffees being made i immediately dart towards the cookies and pitzelles grab a cannoli then make my way over to the fresh pastas being made if i could afford to live inside here i would but then i would eat everything and they would have to roll me out the door hands down this is the best italian market to get all your needs for a nice sunday dinner
2907,i ve been coming here since i was a kid always great stopped by for lunch and was totally ignored while i was not in her station sue took it upon herself to assist me and got my drink order the waitress i was supposed to have finally came over and asked me what i wanted i told her i was already being helped and sue finished the service i was just about to leave when sue approached me thank you sue now i still have great feelings about this wonderful florida institution that is ted peters
2908,truly a joy the location makes you feel like you are going on a little adventure it is quaint and although the desirable tables are near the window overlooking the swamp no seat is a bad one the services are professional and personable and the food is delicious this restaurant is perfect for special occasions and can accommodate large parties bon appetit
2909,i love living here i love being close to all that downtown st pete has to offer but still being far enough to the busier parts of downtown so i can still go home and relax and have quiet time the apartment looks just like the pictures and the grounds are kept nice parking can sometimes be annoying but i don t find it to be a major issue if you plan to move here i definitely recommend working with crystal she will greet you with a smile from the moment you walk in and will be there every step of the way from picking the perfect apartment to making sure you are still happy once you have moved in i wouldn t be as happy as i am with fusion 1560 if it wasn t for her
2910,took my brand new mustang to clear view today roman did a great job removing the stock tint and applying new darker tint this is the 4th vehicle i ve taken to clear view and i keep coming back cuz of the great service and quality tint
2911,this place is great i will be back without question 1 2 1 2 alligator was better than i expected seafood platter included oysters catfish shrimp and stuffed crab and 2 sides the entire staff was friendly and extremely attentive
2912,oh my everything we ordered was so so great starting with the margaritas perfectly smooth the queso was so filling and so yummy finished with duck enchiladas you can not go wrong with this place i can t wait to come back
2913,we went a few months ago and had an appetizer platter which had cheese and honey it was very good prices are somewhat reasonable and the atmosphere is good
2914,we stayed at an airbnb right down the road and it was such a pleasant walk to this cafe met the owner and she was super friendly they accommodated some changes for me on my latte and had some super delicious muffins very spacious and nicely decorated on the inside with an extensive menu would be a nice place for a group or for a solo traveler to get some work done
2915,beer selection great view wonderful shrimp po boy huge and tasty can t really find fault with anything need to come back at sunset
2916,i don t think i d order the steak salad again but the chicken wings were very good and delivered promptly i shall return
2917,the whole experience here was basic i mean i wasn t expecting something amazing but maybe a little better than what we got the burnt ends appetizer was small plated horribly and lacked taste the calamari had a mushy batter and was just bland all of the food that came out looked really good the main courses there were six of us we all got different things i had the cajun pasta it looked great but it was missing taste the same with the st louis ribs meatloaf french dip and greek pizza my daughter got chicken strips that were tasty would i come back maybe just to try a burger it was a little bit better than applebee s oh yeah they had homemade beer that was pretty good
2918,for something billed as a jazz cruise the band didn t play very much the cruise was good we were not allowed in the dining room on time for our 7 45 seating the food was good we ordered drinks right after we sat down but they never arrived when we tried to visit the gift shop after dinner it was closed well before we docked
2919,a nice spot for bbq busy but plenty of open tables food came out under 10 minutes giving four stars because the server rolled his eyes when we asked him a question besides that a good experience,beautiful hipster warm inviting be aware that it smells like a wood stove inside
2920,anthony s in pike creek is my go to any day of the week you can t beat the food and the atmosphere wish them the best with the recent expansion
2921,this double knot sushi satellite eatery is located in the new and posh franklin hall food court i went with a coworker over lunch to try it out though there was a small line it went by quickly the menu has a lot of sushi options but the chef s box seemed like the best deal 16 for 2 pieces of salmon sashimi salmon over rice edamame and 2 rolls definitely a splurge for lunch but i decided to treat myself the meal is packed neatly in a cute little dk box all the sides wasabi ginger soy sauce a spicy sauce are in their own labeled containers very aesthetically pleasing not very environmentally friendly this is what really annoyed me for that giant box of 16 sushi you get one little pea size amount of wasabi pictured granted i am a wasabi fiend but how can they possibly think that small amount is enough for all that sushi i kindly asked for more wasabi and was told it would be a 50 cent charge by the manager i can maybe understand if i ordered one roll or a couple pieces of sashimi but that was just annoying and unacceptable the sushi itself was unbelievable the fish was so fresh and abundant and the rice was incredible definitely way too much food for one person but would be perfect to split with someone my favorite was the salmon over rice with spicy sauce though i ll never spend 16 on a lunch again would definitely come back and order salmon over rice on its own everything else was similarly pricey but worth a once in a while lunch time splurge for high quality sushi
2922,this is a pretty good pancake place but it s a little disorganized in the way it s run when it s really busy the pancakes are pretty good but super sweet so you have to be in there good price point serves breakfast all day so that s definitely a plus but not anything particularly special that you couldn t get anywhere else,pretty cool place to come as a one time thing if you re a nashville tourist filling meal but busy and small building but otherwise super yummy and good spot
2923,great experience using this company both the manager art and the movers themselves were excellent it took 2 movers 2 5 hrs to unload all my furnitures for a two bed townhouse and about 40 heavy boxes full of books and clothes professional courteous and considerate job well done thank you
2924,highly recommend i love having lashes lash therapy is the real deal they ve been doing eyelash extensions since before they were a big thing so they really know what they re doing i love that mine look dramatic but also still look natural and don t seem fake like others sometimes tend to jayme is fantastic and i honestly look forward to my appointments the other techs have done my touch ups a few times and every one of them has been just as great 5 stars highly recommend
2925,food was awesome i got the burger and mozzarella sticks and the delivery was super fast not giving it 5 stars because they didn t put ketchup or napkins in
2926,we stayed here for a long weekend last year 2 kids 1 a toddler and we had a great time all the restaurants were good my son and husband had fun at the arcade hubs enjoyed gambling my favorite hotel in reno
2927,fantastic restaurant had the truffle and foie gras pasta special and it was worth every penny the spicy crab was just as good as was the grilled octopus the service including the host and just about everyone we passed on the way in and out of the restaurant is genuinely friendly and attentive i honestly couldn t have asked for a better dining experience having just moved to the neighborhood i look forward to making this a regular spot
2928,if you like oozy gooey grilled cheese sandwiches then this is the place for you nothing simple about their grilled cheese here from their traditional grilled cheese to the triple decker it s pretty darn good and really cheesy it s cute inside and they added a new little nook inside that does fresh to order salads as well a little pricey but a lot of fresh food
2929,i wanted to try vietnamese for a while so i tried pho at pho le and did not like it then i was told by a friend to retry pho here and it was great didnt disapoint glad i didnt give up on my quest for vietnamese food
2930,great food and wonderful service our server was super friendly and helpful i wanted to change two things on the hot mess sandwich she didn t even blink and was like of course they were crazy busy but our food came out at a reasonable time and my meal was delicious
2931,i have had ups downs staying at the peppermill but as of recently their beautiful resort and level of customer service have blown my mind i stayed here awhile back and had a not so good experience with my girlfriend when i posted a review they immediately reached out and asked for details spoke to me at length about it and then comped me a night to come back and make it right i have since stayed a few more times and have had nothing but positive experiences with them most recently my girlfriend and i stopped in for a night in the beautiful tuscany suite after staying for the night we woke up the next morning to check out and head to tahoe where we rented a house for a few more days once we got to tahoe my girlfriend realized that he left her charger for her apple laptop in the hotel room i called but it had not been turned in the person on the phone recommended i go online and fill out a lost item report i forgot about doing this for a few days but finally got around to it once i filled it i got a response from julie yoshida she asked for some details and a photo next thing i knew she sent an email that they have replaced it and it would arrive certified mail to me wow well done peppermill your level of customer service is above and beyond
2932,the whiskey is just coming of age the brews are distinctive this is not another sierra nevada imitation and the food is both good and a good value upstairs for the non family crowd and downstairs otherwise either way the restored depot architecture is worth checking out
2933,friendly service neat building depending on the atmosphere you are looking for the music is a bit loud
2934,had some gumbo it was very good nice atmosphere and excellent serves drinks were good too desserts were out of this world
2935,awesome healthy food and really nice staff mike went above and beyond to make sure that i got the food that i wanted can t thank this place enough for providing me with some greens and healthy options while visiting nashville
2936,delicious pizza loved the video games and the huge bathroom will be back for sure
2937,sooooo good and refreshing recommend the natural flavors basil lemon and basil grapefruit
2938,this place is amazing and surprisingly delicious fresh food and very clean the staff is friendly plz come try it u won t be sorry
2939,the management is awesome and the food is always made hot and fresh it can get very crowded but that s to be expected in the providence area when it is a popular place
2940,absolutely incredible experience at luke my boyfriend and i went on a weekend trip to new orleans and richy rich waited on us he was personable friendly and had great recommendations he even sat down with us and gave us the recipe for their incredible brussel sprouts we ordered a few appetizers and oysters and he talked to us about their happy hour and invited us to come back the next day we ordered a half dozen oysters but they gave us a dozen at no extra charge we came back the next day and he waited on us again he put in the appetizer we loved from the night before and gave us two glasses of champagne as soon as we sat down all complimentary the fact that he remembered us remembered our order and felt compelled to treat us so special is pretty amazing customer service is tough but he makes it seem like he s having the best time in the world he joked with us that the food is almost as good as the service but truly he s right the food and the service are top notch richy rich made our trip so much more special and we are already looking forward to coming back next time we stop in nola thank you richy rich the whole luke staff
2941,this is probably my favorite beer and burger restaurant in all of nashville m l rose prides itself on offering its clientele local nashville brewery s offerings amazing craft burgers currently my favorite is the belgian which two 2 smashed patties smoked gouda crispy onions chopped bacon and garlic peppercorn aioli amazing when paired with the bear walker brown jackalope brewery nashville visit in the fall and sit outsides round the outdoor fire pit located directly on historic and cool charlotte avenue go to this place
2942,bought the groupon for 10 classes here it was a pretty seamless process to use the coupon the studio is clean and nice but not as full of natural light as i d prefer they have several classes a day in different styles this provides a little more flexibility but given that i had 10 classes it was also sometimes frustrating when i picked a class because it was convenient from a timing perspective but not my favorite teaching style class type overall though the groupon is a great deal not sure how much it is to join the studio regularly,decent pizza joint in center city interior is clean and a good place for a quick meal slices are tasty and generously sized on the pricier side for a plain slice paid 10 for 3 slices
2943,butter s catered my grandmothers repass yesterday kevin was very professional and delivered as promised we found butter s online as we are from brooklyn ny upon arriving at the repass all the food was set up properly with linens drinks and utensils we didn t have to do anything the food was great as well we ordered fried chicken baked chicken mac and cheese collard greens string beans african rice and salad if in philly again i will stop in and dine
2944,if this weren t a diet based restaurant i would ve rated them a 3 the food was good but obviously not as good as other restaurants that cook with naughty ingredients i enjoyed the pizza but wasn t crazy about the massive cherry tomatoes i wish they were most blistered from the fire oven maybe that s a little nit picky regardless i picked about half off the pizza my coworker got the shrimp taco but didn t rave about it we split the chocolate cake and it was good but not great wish it was sweeter kind of a pricey lunch for 2 people at 50 i d definitely return to keep giving them chances because i want them to succeed
2945,years ago we had a basic system installed by sierra air we decided to call them again for a new project we got competitive bids and sierra air was right in line with the others in price this time we required a very complex and intricate mini split system installed fillipa came with his crew and in a day and one half everything was done to perfection other than our house been completely cool for the first time you would never know sierra air was here they were professional clean on time courteous at all times fillipa is a master craftsman there was no problem that he couldn t solve and do it well he made the complicated install seamless there may be companies that charge slightly less but you can t beat a contractor that does the job perfectly
2946,terrible service decent fast food ordered a bottled water and never got it the chicken tenders where nice and decently crispy the setup is a little terrible it s understandable as it s a small place on bourbon street i don t think i will return
2947,well what better way to end a nice family night out than a sweet treat this place is sooooo good a little pricey but worth the money every now and again each of us got a different kids size gelato 3 99 each triple chocolate mint butterscotch and of course oreo this was the cherry to our night the sprinkles is our evening the gelato is just so smooth and tasty we will definitely be back for a family night out
2948,i have been going to this gym for years love the gang here theresa the manger jennifer the personal trainer and the gang behind the counter also great protein shakes as well the gym has all the equipment you could possibly need for a work out the prices are awesome and if you get the tanning package with it even better why go anywhere else rich a
2949,the staff at epic automotive are fast friendly and provide excellent service they remember your name and don t try to oversell you a great local auto repair shop
2950,thank you hotel monaco for restoring our faith in the delightfulness of kimpton properties coming off a less than stellar experience in minneapolis we re looking at you the grand hotel we were unsure what to expect minutes into our stay after interacting with only the valet and front desk we both said this is already so much better and much more what we expect from kimpton properties decor delightfully whimsical as always staff en point every team member we interacted with during our stay room room noise didn t notice any decent sized room for old city outlets available bedside for charging soaking tub bathroom fabulous the water pressure in the shower was also awesome as was water temp this property hasn t updated to include toiletries in the shower so be sure to grab them off the vanity on your way in restaurant great bourbon selection we ate dinner here one night and the ribeye was better than the much more expensive steak at fork location worked well for us we didn t uber anywhere this trip should we find ourselves in philly again we will stay here
2951,so we ve been here a couple times i decided to review it this time because it really is a wonderful place to come they have their own version of city wide specials for 5 which is amazing paired with their cheese board as strange as that may seem we originally came here for the crawfish mac cheese which ended up being the side highlight it didn t really have a savory crawfish taste in every bite but either way we still love this place
2952,ray has serviced two of our autos for years and is fair honest and a great mechanic he has been a huge help in keeping our old cars running smoothly for a fair price we now use him exclusively for our honda and toyota and could never go back to the many crooked car repair services and dealers that we used to go to really honest man
2953,everything i ordered including juice mix was absolutely delicious service was outstanding and i will defiantly come back yammy
2954,great drinks service was on time with complimentary ice cream on the house before we left bombay misbehavior is a must try drink
2955,if you are looking for a quick and tasty dessert at a dog friendly location you should check this place out they stand out with their selection of mini cupcakes that you can pair with a variety of drinks coffee tea prosecco etc in a shot glass i tried their lemon awesome coconut awesome peanut butter chocolate awesome and blackout chocolate can t get enough it s a great little place if you want something small and sweet in addition you can order a pup cake for your dog it involves peanut butter and bacon so the dog i was walking gave it two paws up
2956,my friend and i went for a light dinner each ordering three tacos i got the al pastor tacos when the server asked me which toppings i d like i simply said i trust you he loaded them up with fresh ingredients really fresh and i enjoyed every bite making noises like mmmm and wow and oooh the place is bright clean filled with upbeat music staffed by friendly helpful guys who know how to make a great taco they don t have a large menu but what they offer they do right give it a try i ll be back for sure
2957,great towing experience brandon was the driver that came out to tow my truck and he made it such an easy and un stressful situation took the upmost care of my truck as it was being loaded onto the truck paperwork was easy and conversation to my destination was beyond interesting and entertaining great customer service highly recommend brandon and all points towing for any tow needs
2958,my friend told me to review this place since it has been a big debate in our circle of lard aka friendship if this restaurant is a hit or miss apparently my reviews are something to be judge with contempt besides she s paying i m all about the free food i have been to this place several times and it has not disappointed me in any way but there is a something about this place that the flavors will either make you love it or hate it what i meant is the amount of soy sauce fish sauce salt or pepper including a myriad of spices in their dishes will make you either dehydrated due to the suction it has inhale your bodily fluids or it s so bland that you ask yourself this is asian food right i think that s the appeal of this place it s like going to dinner at a relatives or asian friends house you know the menu but sometimes the taste is something different that it s a conversation starter if you miss your parents cooking go to this place be at home because every time i m there i know that the food will always be good and if it s bland just dip it in soy sauce
2959,really like this place the food is amazing great atmosphere and the hostess has such a positive energy it was my friend s first time and he definitely enjoyed it and wants to come back the shrimp salad with the lime chili dressing was refreshing
2960,neighborhood hot spot this has always been a great place for chicken wings and burgers the servers are hospitable ml rose is one of my favorites
2961,clean restaurant with quick and friendly service today is the 60tg anniversary and they re offering 60 pancakes as a special food is fresh and prepared quickly getting to the restaurant is a bit difficult as it is on a road with a lot of traffic and parking is less than ideal for space it is a bit crowded overall a good experience
2962,this place made me want to move to boise everyone was very friendly and the space is beyond cool also a great selection of beers from the nw
2963,wonderful customer service was done with my services in about 30 minutes attention to detail was spot on shop was clean and welcoming tons of different gel colors to pick from will be returning soon
2964,this is a great place to get a little work done meet a friend and sip a nice coffee note you can get free refills on the coffee which makes it great for a morning study session their sandwiches are quite yummy my fav is the prosciutto one i only wish i could get a few more chips on the side it s a healthy little portion of chips the staff is always friendly and i love the upstairs workspace definitely check it out
2965,oh my goodness one of the best breakfast places i have ever been from the aroma when you first walk in to the coffee and food this place does not disappoint everything was so fresh and full of flavor i m so glad we skipped the line at biscuit love and went here recommended from a local
2966,overall great experience at milk and honey in nashville came here with a party of 6 a few weeks ago the burrata was such a hit that we ordered 2 for the table my husband and i shared a pizza and the porky fried rice we loved both portions here were massive and we didn t come close to finishing either but the porky fried rice was the real sleeper super good the cherry on top a huge selection of delicious homemade gelato don t miss this one if you re in the gulch
2967,if you are looking for an amazing burger look no further than burger joint best burgers in edmonton i order the build your own burger with curly fries and the awesome sauce it is our go to burger place awesome food
2968,i really wish lucky goat would carry skim milk on several occasions they have either not had it or worse handed it to me and then i realized that the expiry date had passed i can imagine that i am not the only person that doesn t like whole milk or cream in my coffee it just seems to me like skim milk should be a staple at a coffee house and it isn t here other than that the service is always friendly and they have a nice assortment of fresh pastries it is for sure a welcome addition to the neighborhood if management reads these reviews please consider having fresh skim milk
2969,my boyfriend and i both decided to try jesse s for the first time after we d both grown up in the brandon area and neither of us had ever been and really hadn t heard much about the restaurant we dined on a saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed we were sat right away at a 2 top next to a window facing sr 60 our server nikki greeted us in a reasonable amount of time we ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that something i did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table but nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non alcoholic drinks she took our appetizer and entree order all at once we ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a french onion soup to share these items came out together the crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a tiny mushroom which was almost laughable but had a good flavor nonetheless the french onion soup had a great flavor and wasn t scalding hot which was super nice to eat right away after our appetizer came out and we finished it our caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter this was also really great pacing of our meal nikki never let empty plates sit on our table was very attentive and always made sure we had drinks in front of us the caesar salads were good i gave the bread two chances once dipped in the french onion soup and once just with butter on it the bread could have definitely been better it just didn t have a good flavor to it i ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz delmonico both cooked medium rare the steaks are served with sauted mushrooms your choice of side and a salad or soup of the day which isn t mentioned anywhere on the menu i got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings i saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us i don t know if it was a kitchen issue or something else but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables i tried to make sense of the delay but it honestly wasn t a big deal to me our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell my filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly but there were not enough sauted mushrooms on the plate in my opinion if i had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak i totally would have gotten them as a side my boyfriend s steak was cooked perfectly as well but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table which he wasn t particularly pleased with he enjoyed his sweet potato with butter but it didn t come out with cinnamon on it like he requested anyway i am sure we will return our server nikki was fabulous she was extremely attentive had a great attitude and was knowledgeable
2970,i have been to the ima a few times they have a wide range of artwork from all different time periods and areas around the world there are four floors inside the museum which gives you plenty to see my only complaint is that the museum s admission has increased significantly over the years i wish it was more affordable
2971,been here for breakfast and lunch the huevos rancheros are delicious my husband likes the build you hash combo their salads are also really delicious please open a dawn patrol in carp
2972,this is a great children s museum i like how it is very compact which makes it easy to keep track of your children we re from out of town and came here on a day it was fairly cold the parking is easy and cheap and the museum itself was free because of a membership we have here at home in columbus there is tons of stuff to do for the kids you can easily spend hours here entertaining the kids the only thing that i d say is a drawback is that there is definitely a certain range of ages that the museum will appeal to
2973,i am obsessed with burgers and i can honestly say this was the best burger i have ever had my friends also agree this was the absolute best every ingredient is so fresh the meat is juicy the sauces the fries we tried the pondorossa which was amazing and my personal favorite which was on a secret menu was their version of a big mac seriously can not say enough best burger ever the place is small and causal and the service is awesome everyone is so nice and you can tell the food is made with only the best 100000 recommend they also had a lot of great vegetarian options
2974,celebrated an event here with my significant other enjoyed the house special of the day which was a lionfish appetizer that was expertly prepared our choice of entrees were well prepared seasoned and served hot by our attentive and friendly waitress we enjoyed the pulled slow braised short rib fat noodle dish and bouillabaisse of seafood dishes our meals were complimented by wine selections served by our knowledgeable waitress who was very helpful in selecting wines that would complement our menu selections wait staff was attentive throughout our meal keeping water glasses full and the table clear as we finished our appetizer we will be returning to this fine establishment to try other selections on the menu and wine list
2975,great little spot in eagle in i believe and covered church recently attended out 2nd cigar wine evening and again really enjoyed ourselfs while my husband enjoyed his cigar i enjoyed the wine and a desert from the restaurant have been here for breakfast loved the french toast i had his eggs benedict also were very good looking forward to stopping in for some coffee in the near future
2976,this was one of our more memorable experience date night for hubby and i star wars new hope with symphony was awesome watching the movie and the orchestra at the same time was so cool if you enjoy these type of performances this is very good the orchestra was great sounds were right on point beautiful arrangement the art of music and film was amazing to watch thank you nashville symphony we will return
2977,great food their food is always fresh i like to get the taquito plate the food is consistent the salsa bar is nice too the creamy green salsa is my favorite i recommend this place to anyone looking for good quality food
2978,the flavor of the smoked ribs are large with great smoky flavor unfortunately today they were charred a bit too much and therefore dry the bbq sauce does help and provided great flavor and the moisture needed the place is a quaint little house just off the main street and the service is friendly
2979,i gotta be honest not really a hulk fan i remember seeing wrestling as a kid and thinking that s a really tan white dude who really likes to rip his shirts he just kinda looks like a tan wrestling santa with huge biceps to me i don t know much about hulkamania history either other than he was thunderlips in rocky iii i m more of a later generation rock fan and if i kick it old school then the iron sheik is my homeboy but since we were in clearwater and my husband is a huge wrestling fan we stopped in to take a picture with statute outside the store we also make our way in and my husband picked up socks and a t shirt the store is entertaining it s way more of a museum than it is a store brush up on your hulk history before you come here because there are lots of belts dvds photos action figures which i call dolls just to annoy my husband and memorabilia keep in mind even though it is called a beach shop there are no really beach type things here other than t shirts i was hoping to buy a hulkster monokini here but no such luck so if you re looking for hulkamania board shorts bikinis tankinis or thongs you re out of luck there is one surfboard here not for sale but on display this is the place to go if you need a s ton of bandanas though they definitely have those so stop in and say hi to the friendly staff take pics with the statue outside and let hulkamania run wild on you brother
2980,these people are great good tires at a great price with road hazard rotation balance and alignment they were cheaper than kaufman s price which was just tires no hassle no slimy sales tactics
2981,fantastic brunch today dishes are thoughtfully put together french toast was to die for just the right lightness in the brioche dads special with corned beef hash another highlight bloody mary bar has pickles made by the chef and was fantastic the chef steve was superfriendly as was our server angel really not a thing to improve and while the restaurant is not cheap we got excellent value for money
2982,talented comedians who handled a bizarre crowd very well it s exciting to see such a good pro up and coming group performing working out their acts in goleta i ll be there to support them as often as i can
2983,love their pizza but i cannot understand what makes the duo a special it costs less to order the pizzas separately
2984,large servings with fresh correctly ripe fruit i will come back
2985,love stopping here for breakfast when traveling up the coast great gluten free pancakes
2986,the food was not only delicious but a really nice family oriented area we loved being able to eat and watch the ocean we will be back
2987,very nice restaurant and a nice addition to the sj dining scene but i d rather spend the extra money and go to the original vernick even with the toll and parking
2988,oh my god incredible you will not regret it there s always a long line and it s worth the wait be adventurous and try as many pancake flavors as you can they won t disappoint 10 10 best pancake place around it s a must,went here the other night for the first time and was pleasantly surprised the menu was so unique and i can t wait to try more of the entrees when i return i had the margarita pizza and it was fantastic it wasn t greasy or sloppy but perfectly crunchy with a nice balanced flavor and cheese perfectly cooked they also have some amazing gelato that we had the pleasure of tasting although i d prefer if they had an option to order a smaller amount of the gelato they only offer it in one size and it s far too much for me one scoop is plenty overall i highly recommend
2989,beignets are amazing breakfast sandwiches are great as well as the french bread the omelettes were also pretty good but the start is the beignets hence the name
2990,we were here for a friend s birthday celebration on a friday night and it was a fun place for a party we had a reserved table live entertainment danced a good part of the night and basically had a great time we had birthday cake and cupcakes too and they even brought us plates and napkins for them everyone seemed to enjoy their food orders we had already eaten earlier so we took advantage of their all day everyday pitchers of killians red for 7 and the pitchers had iced centers keeping the beer nicely chilled and enjoyable we were there at 7 and the tables filled to capacity by the time the band started up lots of dancers on the dance floor too it was my first time here and i would come again,stopped here for a quick lunch since it was right by where we were shopping it was a lucky pick as sometimes close and convenient doesn t always turn out to be that good there is a line with an overhead menu as well as printed menus and you place your order and given a number on a stand to be brought to your table there are self service drinks napkins utensils and containers for leftovers all which makes for a pretty quick lunch we ordered bowls a lamb and a baked falafel power grain bowl both were delicious nicely plated and super fresh grains had good texture and each different component was good on its own prices were reasonable and i would definitely come back again
2991,good pho well prepared spring rolls are skimpy only 3 given with order overall good price good food will be back again
2992,chili chicken salad was really good but ordering is a pain we ordered directly from staff that area is noisy and i couldn t hear the gal s voice i asked her to speak up but she didn t i was asked what type of bread i wanted and i said i didn t want any bread turns out i could have had an apple i heard this when my sister was ordering and asked her cashier if i could get a cut apple since i didn t know that i there was a choice her cashier asked if my sister wanted to pay for it she said no why isn t that free with her meal she finally figured that out the apple arrived at my table uncut tables are usually dirty when i get there saturday was no exception staff near the quick pickup window were yelling and laughing at each other rather disruptive while we were eating food is really good here the staff and cleanliness could be improved tho
2993,the drink menu is everything honey even if you don t order food try something off of the drink menu my friend was raving about the spicy rim margarita while i was loving the kahiki kai the chips and guac were very good i didn t care for the potato tacos but i will definitely be back to try something else tips seat yourself walk back to the tiki bar area because the vibes are much more laid back faster service at the bar,this review is only for the coffee fast service in the morning with no wait the chai latte is super sweet and i like sweet if you aren t into sweet try something else the owner was friendly and the interior is super cute parking on the side of the building i ll be back to try the food
2994,really good breakfast nice stroll off the beaten path to a neighborhood with beautiful architecture large portions great friendly service
2995,this place caught me totally off guard suffice it to say the surroundings do not come anywhere close to representing the quality of the pizza if you like deep dish and cheese you need to visit this place but go early
2996,came at the busiest time on the busiest day but the service and food were very good and worth waiting for
2997,this place is pretty awesome they have a great patio and great beer the staff is extremely friendly and attentive the only thing it has going against them is maybe the area it s in some people might be intimidated by the drive but trust me there s nothing to worry about they also offer 20 off to american homebrewers association members party on garth
2998,i love the independent but was so saddened when they changed the caprese sandwich it now has the option for you to get salami instead of the delicious prosciutto they also changed the salad when i used to love the old one pretty please change it back
2999,a happy hour fav oysters raw and fried never disappoint add in the brussels too dont forget to ask about the 1 2 off cocktail menu as well
3000,i recently had a tattoo done by stacey and it was a wonderful experience the day before i went in to discuss my ideas with her that night she drew a custom piece that was beautiful and exactly what i had envisioned i went in for my piece and the shop was clean well decorated and inviting she really took the time with me to make sure that my tattoo placement was exactly where i wanted it and then did a wonderful job on the tattoo itself i have gotten a few tattoos in different places but this was by far the best experience i have had i will absolutely be recommending this shop to anyone who asks
3001,dined here this past friday night for dinner the restaurant has a very casual feel to it the food was delicious we started with the complimentary garlic oil and garlic knots what s not to like my friends and i split a salad and the fried risotto balls two of us ordered the chicken parm delish and my other friend ordered the steak which was also delicious we shared a piece of cheesecake that melted in your mouth the portions are huge that s what she said our server jenni was fantastic accommodating friendly and efficient bocconcini is also byob which i love would definitely recommend
3002,best pizza in sparks crust is so good the meat eater is my favorite call in advance and show up to pay at least 15 minutes before its supposed to be done the line can get out of control
3003,i ve heard about this place being a great spot now that i ve experience it great scenery vibes and drinks i went for a birthday brunch reserved spots for about 18 people the food was very mediocre according to everyone i got the chicken and waffles and the flavor was very basic for the prices and the way they promote i expected way more i was disappointed in the food and the service for a large group they seem like a decent spot for a small group they were terrible for our large group our waiter was great on refilling drinks food bill boxes and cupcakes too forever some people were ready to go since we were there for 2 hours before we saw a bill or dessert i would try them out again but not in a group and maybe they some other food because the items that we had were not that tasty
3004,this is our go to place after sunday afternoon concert at principia by town country symphony because there are so many good choices on the menu which you cannot go wrong and the staff is so friendly and helpful
3005,even though i work right around the corner i finally had the chance to check out the good oak bar w some friends i feel like we lucked out because we got there around 830ish on a friday night and were able to snag one of the big wooden booths i had the old fashioned and it was pretty good like others have written about the attention to the local arizona detail is what really sets this place apart if most nights also have around the amount of people tonight did i think it also really hits the spot since it wasn t crowded and was just a lovely hang recommend
3006,we arrived in new orleans for our wedding anniversary and decided muriel s was the place for the big meal celebration it is a very nice room the seating the tables and chairs the crockery and cutlery and the general feel of the restaurant is very good the service was excellent and was key to the enjoyment of the whole experience so to the food we wanted cajun style my wife had the soup of the day and boudin balls i ordered a vegetable pot pie with a side of beans first there was bread it was a little doughy more like crusty dumpling than bread the pot pie filling was fair the pastry was sensational and the side of beans with mushrooms and bacon was nice my wife s soup she said was very nice the boudin balls were okay and not as nice as some she had eaten earlier in the day i had two non alcoholic beers a coffee and a shot of sambucca miss had two glasses of white wine and a coffee if a restaurant charges a high price they need to provide a reason to justify it service and ambience are of course very important but to provide ordinary food at an extraordinary price just doesn t quite cut it the above including tip was 137 in summary muriel s is a nice restaurant experience with everything being of the highest quality except for the food which is good but not as good as price and reputation would suggest
3007,jackie was a lifesaver our caterer dropped out with two months to the wedding due to a shoulder surgery we panicked thankfully jackie and his staff came to the rescue and i honestly believe it was meant to be everything was delicious and his presentation was beautiful he coordinated his decor beautifully with our theme we have received nothing but compliments on the food not to mention he did everything we wanted including a raw oyster bar and came in under budget i would recommend him to anyone they just brought our wedding to the next level
3008,awesome english pub great food and amazing place to watch a game we watched a soccer game with a fantastic crowd and stayed to watch baseball after i highly recommend the hms belfast fantastic happy hour can t beat a 2 beer happy hour all day on saturdays
3009,this was my first time here it seemed like a very new establishment everything was clean the kitchen is open so you can see whats going on very very very gooooooood wings and fried rice easy parking and quick service highly recommend this place
3010,randy did a great job on the tour and incorporated some sights regarding the history of the city as well
3011,absolutely delicious restaurant loved our server as well he was extremely chill stupendous service only reason i m not giving 5 stars is because it is a tourist trap place that has astronomically priced meals you re probably going to get that anywhere in this area of the city though however if you re wanting to try any creole new orleans specific means they have it here great place to go if you re wanting to get a flavor for nola
3012,we stopped in for the crab and it did not disappoint the service was friendly and prompt we would definitely recommend this place as the crab and oyster shooters were great
3013,good food awesome drinks can definitely get crowded during the weekend night life hours the shrimp scampi was well seasoned and the mini crab balls were good the mussels could ve had more butter on them though fried shrimp was seasoned well and fried to perfection
3014,fun having a new place to check out in st pete you can tell everything is fresh as they can run out of certain things later in the night which is a pro in my opinion the fish last night was red snapper and grouper it s a cute area outside and i love the color pop of the chairs it s an order at the window bring a number to a table and food is brought to your table place the only con is how long it took for the food to come out it was around 45 minutes it s a new place and i m sure they ll get that figured out you could tell the staff wanted to do a great job and the food was absolutely delicious also i loved the fried pickles
3015,such an awesome place we were from out of town and stopped here for desert such yummy ice cream
3016,wow great calzone this place should have a passport program i want to try each one meat me in st louie had creamy moscarpone with the usual pizza stuff sausage pepperoni mozzarella and a meat sauce on the side of course when they came out we thought gee we could have split one however none of us stopped eating till they were gone waiting for an apple pie dessert calzone employees are all cool and seem happy to be working here i saw two dancing to the music playing in the background if your on the southside of st louis you gotta try this place about 1 2 mile from slu i ll be back
3017,i first went to coincelli i purchased my 2004 rav4 about 10 yrs ago i loved it and especially loved the service area i purchased another rav 4 but not from them but i have it serviced by coincelli they are very professional customer service plus
3018,cute quirky and delicious conveniently located in the hillsboro area great staff fast and friendly the food oh yes awesome try the east nasty and get that side of pickles the parking is okay for downtown too and will get better once the neighboring construction completes
3019,i was so excited to try out the peanut butter bacon burger and i was not disappointed it was just what i wanted with the sweet and salty with the burger my only complaint about the burger is that i asked for medium and it was well done when it came out but it was still good i am jealous of my husband since he ordered the potato salad and i ordered the mac and cheese which is good but that potato salad it was so creamy and to die for and i only had one bite so get the peanut butter burger and potato salad and you ll love it
3020,this is our favorite place to eat around town we always get greeted quickly and the staff goes out of their way to make us happy sam was our server and he did a wonderful job of taking care of us real nice fella megan always has a smile on her face she always makes us feel like a part of the danny boy family my son request the mac and cheese daily great for dogs kids and adults wonderful all around
3021,awesome tour guide was super friendly david was great food was also great and was told of a few more places to eat highly recommended
3022,we tested this place out all due to the santa barbara axxess card membership we all decided on the brew sampler tray and it didn t disappoint we ll return aging for sure
3023,i m in st louis from louisville to visit the city museum and go to cardinals opening day i had my son and his friend with me so you can imaging my frustration and stress when i noticed something falling from underneath my car firestone cac was the closest auto care establishment to my location when my car started making noises the staff looked at my car immediately fixed the problem as assured me i was good to go i was so impressed with the professionalism courtesy and quick turn around time i only wish this shop was in louisville
3024,i was brought in by a coupon in the mail for the 1 99 two eggs hasbrowns toast breakfast a very good deal i arrived around 8 45am on friday and aside from a few other patrons the place was empty service very poor it looked to me like the staff was all retirees who i imagined in my head were all part owners eg friends that decided to cash in their retirements to open a restaurant i waited at the bar for over five minutes before the guy who i passed outside chatting on his phone came in and took my order no condiments or salt pepper were provided with my food and my coffee cup sat empty for close to 10 minutes i got 1 refill total the food came out in an appropriate amount of time from ordering when i was done my plate w napkin silverware on it pushed away from me sat for 5 minutes it wasn t until i pulled out 5 put it down on the bar and started to get up that someone called across the restaurant you done and brought me the bill they missed charging for the coffee which i pointed out there were plenty of people moving around working but the ratio of employees to patrons couldn t have been worse than 2 1 i don t know what they were all doing but they seemed awfully busy for the number of customers and none that i saw displayed characteristics that i d associate with restaurant experience aside from whomever prepared my food when i ordered a coffee i heard the guy ask someone else where spoons were i could see a bottle of tobasco sitting next to salt pepper under the bar and when i asked for tobasco the guy walked to the other end of the bar to get one not knocking the guy but after 2 months of being open they ought to have a system in place to know where everything goes where to get it from if they were actually busy these are the things that snowball into big delays frustrated employees and frustrated customers food good completely met my expectations and the coffee wasn t bad which is my standard since so many places mess up coffee decor cleanliness seemed very clean which i appreciated and the decor i liked definitely seemed like the type of place i would go to have a few beers location as others have noted you can t turn left onto main st leaving the restaurant which is a bit of an inconvenience they also have two entrances on the north and south sides of the restaurant which certainly can t help their already lackluster service they should think about ways to manage customer flow or post a sign asking people to enter from one side and allowing people to leave from either additional notes i asked if i could chat for a few minutes with someone to provide some friendly feedback as i d like to see them succeed and was told to call at 2pm i didn t particularly care for this and it would have saved them this long public critique online for all to see since there are obviously issues they need to address perhaps they should put boxes w comment cards pens on their tables the bar to allow patrons to provide feedback that way this might save them from people leaving poor yelp reviews too they could build a customer list by asking for a name e mail and incentivize feedback by advertising that comment cards w feedback will be entered into a weekly or daily drawing for a 15 off coupon or something like that kill 2 birds b c they d start building a list of potential return customers to send sparingly few i hope announcements for special events like their grand opening st patrick s day etc they should consider investing in some condiment baskets that have salt pepper ketchup tobasco etc that they can put out for people w food orders at the bar tables pretty foolproof method imo keep kids out of the kitchen a nice young girl was walking around back into the kitchen area and brought a glass from out back and stacked it on the clean glasses in the bar area children shouldn t be handling utensils plates glassware etc that patrons will be using if you want to put them to work teach them to take orders with a notepad greet seat incoming customers and or bus tables running a profitable restaurant isn t easy figuring it out as you go is a surefire way to go out of business and with two months under their belt clearly isn t working if you screw things up with first time customers the likelihood of them coming back ain t good so first impressions are direly important they ought to hire an experienced restaurant general manager to run the place and he she can hire good wait staff i hope the owner or someone working for d town reads this
3025,my husband got us signed up for this class as a surprise for my birthday and it was hands down one of my favorite experiences mike and yoon were very personable and made the cooking class a one of a kind experience we went for the claw and order and got to make manhattan and new england clam chowder we also got to make a low country boil and cheesy pull apart bread not only was everything delicious but it was interactive and engaging we had a blast to say the least we plan on taking more classes
3026,drink are pretty good they re decently priced do have specials the food is good depending on what you get i recommend the shrimp platter or their boneless wings which is what they re known for
3027,love this nail salon it s in my neighborhood reasonably priced with all the amenities you come to expect at an upper scale nail salon fizz bombs complimentary cold refreshment fresh rose petals in the water along with fresh limes add to a blissful escape thank you to my nail technician who did a wonderful job delivering on the overall experience i ll be back and am telling all my friends
3028,best veggie muffaletta eggplant fries were amazing table service was fine hostess stand was fickle and it wasn t mary there were two four tops but they refused to seat us because we were three
3029,i love the toastery we come here every week to eat breakfast this place is huge and has such a nice vibe staff are very friendly and the prices are amazing the food is very good quality and they have a huge variety from everything to vegan gluten free and regular breakfast fare this area needed another breakfast place i don t want the toastery to close i don t want to be forced to have to go to the same old breakfast places on the main line again get your butts to the famous toastery
3030,4 stars for value compared to food quality i had chicken fried steak with real mashed potatoes and it was good tip order gravy on side friends had steak and lobster 10 special it was ok they said they would order again for 10 bucks
3031,really great place hidden in nature the service is very friendly and food wasn t bad this place is a hidden gem that looks like someone s house
3032,burger king is an okay alternative to mcdonalds 6 10 would recommend but idk about coming again
3033,everything is delicious awesome new location and hours must try philly cheese steak and burgers wonderful bloody mary s as well
3034,the staff was nice but not a great meal i had the ice coffee which was just okay i also ordered the crawfish touffe if this was the first time i had touffe i would have never ordered it again the crawfish didn t look or taste fresh the dish itself tasted more like a watery gumbo we also ordered a side of fried green tomatoes which were pretty good along with that we ordered the healthy breakfast which was a good dish there are way better food places than this one save your time and money and go somewhere else
3035,they are good maybe it s my preference to another favourite thai place i have but their tom yum or kah isn t as tasty as comparison the pad thai is great
3036,as cool as it gets we ordered an iced the golden axe and it was unlike any coffee drink we had tried before i wish we had time to try more casual vibe beautiful decor and a perfect place to instagram your coffee
3037,the food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere has a quiet comfortable feel there is definitely a family vibe the pad thai was wonderful so happy to find an authentic thai restaurant near me
3038,trident never disappoints for me it s going to largely be bar cuisine but i find it quite delightful i go here not when i m in the mood for something healthy though the paleo bowl would fulfill that if you are looking for something healthy i go here when i went delicious bar food if you like regular nachos the kind with real melted cheese not fake cheese sauce these are some of the best you can get they re nothing crazy no unique twist just damn good nachos if you want fancier nachos try elsewhere but here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos the half portion is more than sufficient for one person i cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion i m a vegetarian so i never get it with beef but you can totally add a meat option should you wish also delicious is their mac and cheese it s so cheesy never dried out and always has some nice cheese melted right on top you can get it as a side with many of their burgers or you can order the entre sized and in my opinion you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese because green chilis are a gift i love their caprese appetizer as well standard mozzarella tomato basil balsamic but it s always tasty same with the mozzarella sticks their white bean hummus plate is also delicious the other thing i love about trident is they do what in my opinion all restaurants with burgers should do they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty it s baffling to me how many places don t even offer a veggie burger at all they re frozen not that hard to keep them stocked or if they do they re hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu why in the world if you already have veggie patties on hand do i have to order the one veggie burger you have listed why can t i just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option it drives me bonkers but for trident this is never the case the mushroom swiss looks good to you they ll make it with a veggie patty the green chile burger looks great they ll make it a veggie etc etc etc it s a standard boca burger which are ok normally i avoid boca burgers but trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger i recommend the green chile with a boca burger and add a fried egg side salad and no bun if you want low carb or if you re indulging side of mac cheese for non vegetarians my friends are always happy to eat here too popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers the non veggie burgers the crispy shrimp po boy and the paleo bowl they also have a fully stocked bar good prices on their beverages and the wait staff has always been friendly and kind word of caution if there s football on it s probably going to be crowded here so plan accordingly
3039,spoke with jeff over the phone and he was super helpful kind and very patient during my myriad of questions really helpful fabulous employee excellent representative came by to join and met the assistant manager john a very professional high energy human toured me around the gym showed me all the opportunities i have to work out including the extra spa features in the upgraded black membership i am very excited about the infrared therapy for its collagen producing benefits and the massage tables morgan is the in gym personal trainer that offers free instructional classes as well as personal goal and best practices for achieving your goal i signed up for black membership on the spot fabulous prices twenty four hour no excuses open time i am looking forward to the judgment free zone and all the great workout thank you to the dream team who invented a amazing priced gym and it s decorated in my favorite color purple
3040,incredible service from two amazing bartenders awesome food fun atmosphere with great music and a can t miss dessert sampler
3041,finally a great option for food and drinks before a flight service was quick and extremely friendly food and drinks were both excellent john bartender was very friendly and attentive very accommodating to tweaks on menu listings well worth the walk around the corner near gate 62
3042,my family and i used to be huge fans of don pablo s we would probably go at least once per week but we were converted by on the border i can definitely say that on the border is the best local place for mexican their food is consistently good and i don t think they ve ever messed up an order of mine the only downside is that the service here can be incredibly slow i ve had several trips to on the border where my waiter only came to my table three times when we ordered when he brought out our food and to give us the check while the food is great the service definitely leaves something to be desired
3043,people are hard on dinardo s for the decor but we didn t go last night for decor we went for blue point crabs and they were great we each had 2 jumbos that were steamed and seasoned perfectly started with plump mussels in a red sauce we finished with a spoon every member of their staff was friendly and attentive
3044,so this place is pretty dope in more ways than 7 if u walk out spending 300 on food and drinks u would be eating and drinking very well for a couple weeks that s about how long that food and drinks would last me the bakery section is craaaaaazzzzzyyyy with all these tempting evil things my only knock on the place is it s so crowded all the time i don t like feeling like i m in the club bumping elbows with other humans and what not i know weekend are the craziest times to go and that s when it s the best for me to go having a shopping cart and having to dip and dodge others isn t sexy at all that s my only complaint which really is a compliment to how off the chain the place is because otherwise nobody would go there to begin with can u smell what i m cooking
3045,best kept secret italian in the area fabulous home made pastas and excellent service
3046,this place was a short walk from our hotel and a wonderful find awesome ambiance with very pleasant service my lemon blueberry scone was the best i ve ever had anywhere and full of berries the ham and cheese croissant was delicious too took some fresh made bread with us to take wine tasting later this afternoon also noticed it is located near figueroa mountain brewing co so perfect if you want a sandwich with your beer
3047,came in on a friday night with a few of my cousins and sister glad we made a reservation because there was a few group waiting for tables we got seated right away and was served complimentary cornbread fritters so yummy and different there were a total of 4 of us and we shared the 4 for 8 beer samples because that way we could try each other s beer i m not a beer person so i didn t really enjoy them but they re good to try out if you do like beer our waitress did inform us that they brew their own beer and spirits in the house which was interesting let s get to the food part we ordered the fish and chips shrimp tacos with spicy coleslaw roasted pork dip and the chicken sandwich most of their gastro fare items came with a choice of regular french fries or sweet potatoes fries the food was great great balance of flavors and proportions our waitress which we forgot her name so sorry but she was great she answered all our questions about the beers and the food on the menu since we told her it was our first time she checked on us occasionally even when the place was filled with people overall this experience has been amazing the depot is a chill hangout place great for groups and good drinks and food the decor is so aesthetic definitely will be coming back to try other items on their menu and bring more friends just to hang out
3048,so i can t believe how well this firm did for me without breaking my bank i got a dui while leaving iv and it devastated me i hired this firm to help reduce the stress and save me they did exactly what i needed this firm excels because they have extremely well client communication the lawyers are experienced and are very wise their paralegals and whoever else is managing everything is extremely professional and organized they care about the client
3049,wow i got mine to go it was phenomenal i don t remember exactly what i ordered by name but it was more than i expected i live close by and will be back multiple times
3050,the food was well prepared portions were generous and service was attentive we went for lunch and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience the eggplant pirogue eggplant with crawfish cream sauce was delicious as were the boiled crawfish and shrimp
3051,some of the best damn bbq i have ever tasted the briskets was so tender it melts in your mouth mac and cheese potato salad and peach cobbler are to die for we drove from phoenix to try this app place and i couldn t be more satisfied i am so full i don t know if i can drive back home
3052,i ve come to sphinx a number of times to get a greek salad with gyro meat and i am always delighted it comes with a generous amount of meat and i love that i can customize exactly how i want else i want on my salad the staff are pleasant and kind the price is fine i m glad to support sphinx and will keep coming
3053,in town for essence festival and all i can say is how do service workers do it with all these people anyway absolutely loved the shrimp and crabmeat omelette spencer our waiter has a killer smile
3054,absolutely fantastic experience our family of four including 10 and 11 year old kids like to find great places for breakfast first watch is great we shared belgian waffles egg tacos an omelette and avocado toast it was delicious we will be coming back my daughter said we should give it 10 stars out of 5
3055,decided to have lunch here after picking up dinner at lazzaroli s sat at the sidewalk tables as it was a beautiful sunny day got a 12 thin crust w pep onion garlic and some sweet tea between the hostess and the server they were engaging and friendly they boosted the experience from 4 to 5 stars the pizza was perfect there is just no other description for it i m not normally a big fan off thin crust but just wasn t feeling like a heavy deep dish so i tried it i ve never had a thin crust this good it was cooked to perfection wasn t burnt or under cooked it was just right with a great flavor and texture and wasn t loaded with grease from the sauce cheese pep onion and garlic they all came together with a wonderful taste that made it hard not to eat the whole thing if i didn t love trying new places i d be back here every day
3056,still my favorite roast beef poor boy in the city bring your wet naps you re going to need them hot roast beef and an ice cold dixie ahhhh that s living
3057,if you want a hole in the wall pizza place this is where you should go i don t know why more people don t know about this place the pizza is amazing maybe even best pizza in stl i love it i wouldn t classify it as chicago style though because it doesn t have chunky tomato sauce
3058,a unique gem the outside design just attracts me it is on the corner of this huge building on the inside it has two floors with lots of seating and a bar in the middle of the first floor they have a patio too the only thing i do not like about it is the motion sensor light in the restroom i am glad i tried their food i ordered the blackened salmon sliders appetizer i enjoyed it because i asked to hold all the toppings except the spinach and to add pickles the salmon looks like about 2 oz each for the 3 sliders i choose my side to be fries over tator tots delicious tasty satisfying healthy just to name a few at 10 pm it becomes an adult only late night restaurant the clientele is small but seems upscale and from carmel they have lots of specials join the mob
3059,this place was great it was our first time here and the service was excellent we ordered the famous crab cakes which were sooo good crispy on the outside and moist on the inside the cashier let us sample a few of the salads i definitely recommend getting the potato salad also it was after 4pm so many of the salads were half off
3060,tenisha was lovely i was in a very cross mood with my husband and the key failed to work had to go back to the desk and she was very kind and apologetic offered free snacks for which we declined the room is exquisite the linens and pillows made me feel like i was sleeping in zero gravity breakfast was superb i was referred by dr william beeson my ent to stay here following surgery we shall return kudos to tenisha
3061,let s start off with positives on a saturday night around 8pm we didn t have a wait and the restaurant looked very nice an upscale sports bar basically the service was good and the server was very attentive until the end when we wanted our check i ordered the fish tacos the tacos were extremely small and did not have a lot of fish or anything else we ordered the buffalo cauliflower which was very good we also ordered the chicken skewers which tasted average but once again a smaller portion somebody else at the table ordered the tavern burger which looked really good even though they forgot the bacon she said it was delicious
3062,such a lovely family owned restaurant we love the food love the service enzo s pizza is the best in the westchase area in my book one item that we tried and has become a favorite is their blackened wings yup italian place that makes a great wing our favorites are chicken francese and any of their pizzas lunch is fast and inexpensive too go
3063,this spa delivers the atmosphere here is perfect calming and fancy i felt like a princess there it s very clean and the masseuses are quite good just make sure to speak up if they start pushing too hard during a massage it s so tranquil there i want to go back one day
3064,great experience barely had to wait and service was quick and pleasant the bonuts are a must to share with the table i would also recommend the princess with an egg over easy my husband enjoyed the sec although he agreed the princess was better
3065,was in the area and was looking for a breakfast place found this gem and couldn t be happier the in house made sausage and the chipotle sauce made their burrito easy to devour the french toast is light and not too sweet can t wait to come back and try their lunch menu
3066,love this place amazing aa bowls and fresh juices took away a star bc they didn t have hand soap in the bathroom
3067,i dined here on a thursday night and it was very busy service was friendly and prompt i split a pizza with someone and it was just okay way too much cheese and very little sauce it was also served melted to the point where everything was sliding off of the dough i definitely prefer ciao s but i m from north jersey originally so very little in de measures up to my pizza standards the place could also have been a little cleaner like floors tables menus etc a lot of friends and coworkers are always recommending this place but i just don t get it
3068,came here for the first time today for breakfast wait time was about 45 min but the place is super tiny so made sense the grits were really good i also had the migas which was as well great unique place and we enjoyed our time there the only thing i was bummed about is that there wasn t any alcoholic drinks we really wanted a bloody mary with our breakfast
3069,i ve been using no label for a few months now via market wagon as someone with celiac disease i can honestly say i ve tried my fair share of gluten free things no label is by far the best gluten free bakery for bread cookies brownies anything unfortunately i am on the far south side of the city and rarely make it to the north side so i haven t been able to visit their store front until now ive had to use market wagon to get their breads and baked goods i was so excited to finally be able to visit them they were actually fairly busy when we went on a saturday late afternoon we got in and out quick and they were very helpful i didn t see any bread out but if you don t see any be sure you ask they had a ton in the back they just keep it in the fridge we purchased a lot since we aren t able to make it up to carmel much we purchased a loaf of white bread a cereal bar peanut butter brownie and nutter butter cookie sandwich everything was so great my husband isn t gluten free but he even loved everything he tried i love no label and will always use them for my gf baked goods
3070,this place was ok i like how they offer you something to drink and the music is spa like prices seem a bit extreme for the establishment 2 charge to use a credit card is ridiculous they have a variety of colors it can get a little hectic since they are busy i was not overly impressed as some of the reviews say
3071,absolutely the best italian food around always my favorite place for a date night food never undelivers
3072,i ve wanted to check out delicia for so long when a friend and i decided to head out for dinner during devour indy i was so glad to see them on the list the guacamole they served as an appetizer was great i m a guac lover and the pistachios added a really nice flavor to it we both chose the salmon and fell in love with this dish the salmon was perfectly cooked juicy and flaky the polenta was amazing i left wishing i had ordered another to have the next day it was nice having the signature drinks included with dinner he chose the sangria and i chose the margarita both were very good i ll definitely be back to delicia for dinner again this place was a great choice
3073,super happy there is finally a place in the city doing smoothie bowls they only use an acai base more like a sorbet it is tasty and doesn t melt as quickly as a typical smoothie bowl the bowls are topped with whatever you want i had the pbj bowl with bananas and nutella added i wish they had a pitaya base as well like frutta bowls and playa bowls overall this place delicious and i can t wait to try some of the smoothies
3074,we just drove to this bakery because we read lots of baked goods low carb low sugar and many items gluten free so if you have some allergies then give this place a try the price is ok small bred is 4 but if you have changed your eating give this a try
3075,big store decent selection plenty of parking and rather convenient location the building is well lit items are always stocked and if you have trouble finding anything employees aren t far to ask everyone seems in a positive mood happy to greet you and happy to help i am a big fan of the fresh squeezed juice their sandwiches and all the snacks you can buy i don t do my regular weekly shopping here but i still stop in frequently and pick up a thing here and there when i need or have a want for it i have no complaints about this location it s wonderful
3076,great gyros family run friendly staff the owner is super personable and you can pick up a great lunch for under 10 in just a few minutes highly recommend
3077,it was amazing it was so hot but once the music started i didn t care how hot it was anymore you can tell that the members of the band loved what they do it was so much fun and an amazing experience i would go all of the time if i lived closer
3078,best to check in on here to get a table because there is usually a wait coffee is strong and food is amazing i almost licked my plate will definitely go back when i visit again crab and crawfish benedict was amazing i also got a bit of my husbands pancakes before he inhaled them and all i can say is yummy
3079,sharen s took my order for delivery and a beautiful arrangement was delivered within an hour and a half great customer service and beautiful flowers thanks again sharen s for making my friends day
3080,this place is awesome my kids ages 10 and 6 loved it we were there for 3 hours but could have easily stayed all day so many hands on activities for all ages and beautiful views on top deck kinda disappointed with the museum store i was looking for more souvenir type stuff but all they had were limited sizes of t shirts they should really add more custom moxie stuff other than that this place is great we ll be back
3081,this placed really delivered it s my first visit and i wasn t sure what to expect but they really have a wide variety to choose from are you looking for fish and chips burgers or something healthy you can satisfy your cravings here the deserts are pretty good too this isn t a fine dining 5 star restaurant but for who they are and what they provide they deserve 5 stars tonight thanks for the great food and service
3082,let me start by saying that my wife and i are vegetarians so eating most of their more popular dishes isn t possible but so far what we ve been able to eat we ve really enjoyed our normal visit consist of overindulgence on appetizers the pretzel bites are amazing same thing with the grilled brie apple and honey sandwich we ditch the bacon i know sacrelidge but the star of the show is always the fries we usually get the smack fries which are outstanding also a fan of the fried pickles misses so far have been the veggie quesadilla bland and ordinary and the spinach artichoke dip pasty and again rather plain their beer and drink selections are wonderful only negatives in two visits is the sometimes slow staff even when not busy and old ass dilapidated parking lot
3083,great service and food was good too ready made salad was wilted and they made me a new one also friendly and very helpful staff
3084,sandwich is delicious and all home made except bread they are so kind they heard my daughter has a food allergy and they didn t want her to be hungry to go to church they made another new sandwich for my daughter my daughter loves it bubble tea is delicious as well i love everything hot they made warm jasmine green tea with bubble for me they are amazing you won t regret it if you go there good luck
3085,this is probably my favorite thai restaurant food is amazing and service is great the place is deceiving you may pass it by driving and not know the true gent it is
3086,awesome atmosphere and even better pizza owner served us and was a gentleman checked in on us regularly and made sure we were well taken care of would highly recommend to anyone in the area
3087,i absolutely love this place beautiful atmosphere amazing food friendly staff and average price couldn t recommend any more
3088,very helpful staff and a ton of awesome shoes so much stuff that is hard to find dope spot
3089,good food the portions are much larger than what we were told so we ended up leaving a ton of food the salt cooked if more like fried but in salt don t know how to describe it it s good but you need to eat it hot the dumplings were ok kinda greasy i think you need to know what you want because the wait staff while i think really trying to be helpful wasn t as much as i would have hoped
3090,i have a pcp here for the past 3 years she is wonderful she gets my form approved for medicaid transportation every year she refills my psych meds when i m in a bind if anyone is looking for a pcp go to dr maria delacruz shes sweet and spends as much time as you need sometimes it takes a few weeks to get a appt but if your really sick you can get in right away,this was my 1st time here i had the man do my pedicure he took his time doing my feet and then he did a great job painting my toenails i will defentily come back here again
3091,we always have a nice dining experience when we go for dinner great food and service
3092,must try the chicken alfredo it is my favorite and somehow caruso s makes theirs taste different from any other restaurant i ve been to i usually call to place my order and no matter what day or time it is they take around 15 min before they call back to let me know it is ready this is convenient since i live 15 minutes away and can start driving as soon as i place my order that order will come with a bag of garlic bread too and if you like cannolis my friend praises them and always orders one when we come here i have sat in the restaurant several times before and i never had any awful experiences the waiters may take a while to get around and back to your table but this only happens when they re understandably busy
3093,we stopped by today for iced coffee and wow amazing my husband s got the snickers and i got the fluffy bunny caramel and toasted marshmallow delicious and cheaper than starbucks
3094,great customer service they were very friendly from the moment i walked in quick to go order i had the alfredo which was really good with extra mushrooms and the parmesan chicken had plenty of meat and veggies and the small was enough to fill me up before work my only disappointment is with the chocolate chunk cookie i didn t realize it was oatmeal oatmeal is okay but it s not the same as a real chocolate cookie i wish it was labeled on the cookies oatmeal choco chunk
3095,this is the half order of brisket nachos half order it s a ton of food also pictured is the smokehouse burger this is our first visit here great place to come to see a game as there are numerous tvs and friendly wait staff as well charles was our server and he made a couple of great recommendations we also tried the honey fiery shrimp as an appetizer some at our table liked it better than others i prefer to taste the shrimp and this could have been any protein fried and drowned in sauce tasty yes shrimp not really we will be back and ask for charles
3096,i love this place they treat you like your the only one here plus give you champagne pricing is amazing treated like a wueen
3097,hidden gem starting with my extra foam cappuccino paired nicely with my warm poached black mission figs and finishing with my perfectly toasted prosciutto cotto sandwich perfect crunch on every bite would ve given them a 5 star rating but the service was okay other than that highly recommend
3098,i ve been going to kary s salon for about 4 years now she and all her stylists are great and talented at what they do i started the process of going blonde here and i always get compliments on my hair every person that asks me who does my hair i always refer them to kary s salon their prices are also very reasonable compared to other salons in the city with my full set of highlights i usually spend about 2 hours here so i m always seeing the cuts they do these ladies actually listen to what you want and they do what you want when i tell kary i only want an inch off she does exactly that they are great at cutting men s hair as well my eyebrows are always on point because of them if i could give them more stars i would
3099,my absolute favorite place to eat consistent high quality food and amazing service i definitely reccomend everyone try out their brunch
3100,love this place the ironic thing is that this restaurant is in the meadowood mall food court and it is one of our favorite restaurants in the reno area the first time we tried it we loved it so much we went back 2 days later we have been back a few more times since the shrimp scampi is absolutely delicious and the fish tacos are the best my husband has ever had can t wait to try their fish and chips which seems to be their signature dish around the holiday season they were even selling their wild caught alaskan cod frozen by the pound to take home i don t know if they do that year round it was 7 95 per pound which is a great price love the place and we will be back
3101,super amazing atmosphere fresh and exciting vibe brunch menu is incredible with a mimosa bucket great for night out with friends and family
3102,i went here to grab dinner and a drink with a friend from out of town the open design and open view to the barrel storage gives this place a laidback and warm vibe it s also huge we arrived at about 7 30 on a friday night and while the place was crowded we didn t have to wait to be seated they have a great selection of beer and i was excited to try some of their more unique options however i was disappointed to learn that they don t do flights you have to order the 4 oz pours and they will only let you order one at a time that was a bit of a bummer we also ordered dinner i got the fish tacos which were pretty good heads up there are no sides with any of the plates so while the food was good you probably need to order two things or plates to share if you are planning on making a meal out of your visit overall i really enjoyed my experience but i m not rushing back i will continue to take out of towners as a nice laid back option bonus points for it being walking distance from my place but i really wish they would incorporate flights into their menu,this place should be called crawl not marathon while the food is decent and the prices are reasonable the speed of the service was beyond slow my friend and i walked past marathon after going to the kimmel center the menu looked good and the prices were surprisingly reasonable for the area so we stopped in the atmosphere was welcoming imagine steakhouse meets fair trade coffee shop i know that s a hard atmosphere to conjure but i swear it s the most accurate warm but focused on natural woods and cool lighting but you can tell they definitely serve meat anyway the menu was basic americana burgers salads sandwiches and a couple of more expensive entrees here s where things got a little rocky our server was painfully unaware of what their rotating drafts were i m sorry but telling someone it s a yards does not describe the beer and it took at least 15 minutes to get our drinks after ordering we each got a beer on tap after we got our drinks and ordered it took another 30 minutes to get our food which was a burger and crab cakes the food was solid and the sweet potato fries were quite delicious but just not worth the wait overall this place was just mediocre and probably not worth seeking it out given all the other options around
3103,country sweets made both my baby shower cake and most recently my daughter s baptism cake both cakes were absolutely to die for my daughters baptism cake consisted of a dense moist almond pound cake with a raspberry mousse filling it was mouth watering the cake was a lot larger than i anticipated ordered a 14 round cake and we had 36 adults and 6 kids and we still had 1 2 a cake left and everyone had a very generous portion of cake great quality great price friendly service and a beautiful cake safe to say you have a customer for life see you for her 1st birthday cake
3104,signature parking have provided the valet service at our corporate hq since 2016 wow every single interaction has been spot on from the contract negotiation to the account management and billing seriously they have immaculate customer service i don t know what they do to keep their valet attendants happy but they hire well and there has been very little turnover this is white glove service at its best if you are looking for the best look no further they blow the competition out of the water
3105,this neighborhood gem is fantastic the food ambience service variety etc all top notch the base menu has many outstanding choices and there were several great additions to the menu as well i ordered the pork osso bucco which perhaps was the best i ever had and my wife had the crab cakes which were top notch the desserts are home made and outstanding it s a byob which we personally really like augusto s is like dining in manhattan in the heart of bucks county we will certainly be back again
3106,food here was amazing tried the crawfish etouffe red beans and rice gumbo jumbalaya oyster po boy and cheese grits all great and we had the best server his name is dominique seriously a great guy make sure to ask for him when you go oh and the bread pudding phenomenal my husband even liked it and he normally does not like bread pudding
3107,what a hidden gem visiting the area and decided to stop in for a quick bite we are so glad we did the place is clean the staff is super friendly and the food was awesome reminded me of a taco place i always visit when traveling to atlanta ga we will definitely be back
3108,my husband and i stop on and whim last night we re only been there once before at the bar but we decided to stop for dinner i m glad we did the waitress was great and the food was good we will definitely stop in if in the area again
3109,the food at this location was amazing i throughly enjoyed the food and service provided by ciara i couldn t find my receipt so i m not sure if the spelling is correct however ciara was pleasant responsive quick and knowledgeable about the menu and the surrounding areas i would definitely visit this location again p s the jalapeo cornbread was delicious
3110,we enjoyed our meal consisting of two sonoran hot dogs chips and salsa and a dish with various meats nothing mind blowing but it didn t have to be recommended highly
3111,we were in the neighbourhood for an earlier evening event i remembered how much i enjoyed this place in the past so i suggested we walk over for supper i still like this restaurant friendly service large portions and speed of food service is consistent from when i was here a few years ago we all enjoyed our meals and didn t feel rushed to leave our table however the years seem to have caught up to the place floor is noticeably worn down where the chairs are sliding back and forth at the tables bathroom was tidy but nothing exceptional by any means definitely want to watch that slightly raised floor going out of the bathrooms or that could be a tripping hazard everything is decently clean within the restaurant but this would only be a casual lunch place for me in the future
3112,i know finley s is known for great irish food but the nachos are delicious lots and lots of fresh toppings and fresh chips highly recommend the nachos
3113,i have been once so far i ll go back but here s why it gets 3 stars for now 1 i showed up on a friday morning which also happened to be the first day kids in the area were out for school and national donut day long line to give the order but it moved quickly so that was a relief however ding 1 was that they ran out of rainbow sprinkles whoops time to amazon prime a giant bucket of sprinkles i presume that as they get more time under their belt they ll be able to plan anticipate a bit better on this kind of thing 2 order form was a little confusing and others around me were equally perplexed thinking that each donut needed its own form made for some confusion in the prep too 3 given the long line we had to wait quite a while to get the donuts we ordered 6 total the plus side to that was that the donuts we got were warm even by the time we got back home they were churning out donuts as fast as they could make them 4 sadly a couple of the donuts were slightly undercooked not to the point of inedible but definitely noticeable these kind of donuts could easily be overcooked and turn dry so i like that i didn t get the latter however an extra 20 seconds in the fryer would have been beneficial overall the concept is very cute and insta worthy donuts decor i do kind of wish i had a donut base option besides cake and perhaps on busy days some already made options might speed things up i ll be back at some point
3114,we have been customers of alpine lock and key with our home up in tahoe donner forever awesome service awesome response and jake is awesome too work is always performed in a professional and timely manner would recommend alpine jake to everyone in the tahoe reno area many thanks tom deborah tahoe donner truckee ca
3115,waffle house has been part of my life since i was a kid it was a required stop on family road trips through the south later in my 20s it was a required early morning spot after a night out clubbing there was nothing like a double waffle with double bacon to soak up all the alcohol and yes i dodged a few fights at 3am back in the day before most had security on the weekends i still love waffle house and their waffles are the gold standard for me the great thing about this chain is consistency in all those years i can t remember having a bad meal more than a couple times anywhere this waffle house is the closest to my home so we often head here for a meal what s there to say waffle house employees are friendly and fun the food is great but i now tend to eat there in the early evening and sober
3116,the food is good and the service is good but everything is overpriced as you d expect from a restaurant at a fancy hotel golf course the decor in the restaurant is nice and it is a very clean restaurant
3117,came for lunch on the recommendation of a native louisianan shrimp basket was good mac cheese reminded me of easy mac with bread crumbs added not impressed poboy bread was good shrimp was not the same as the basket more popcorn shrimp that nice sized no sweet tea why really no seriously why boiled shrimp appetizer had no cajun seasoning was simply just boiled with garlic very lack luster probably wouldn t come back but maybe it s due to us coming when they had just opened for the day either way was not impressed
3118,where are the cakes every time i stop by there are only two cakes available one of the choices is always honey lavender which i don t care for so that leaves me with one cake the slices used to be a nice size but today the slice was on the thinner side so much so that as i was leaving the store i wondered if something was in it when i did open the box the slice was pretty thin as i expected and quite messy no wonder it took so long to cut cutting it even slightly bigger might have stopped it from crumbling so it would have been nice if i was told about the crumbled condition before i got home and opened the box i really like their cakes but am getting tired of dropping in and not finding any cake choices
3119,we were in town for a wedding but arrived before check in time they were able to accommodate us with an early check in everyone was super welcoming and friendly the room was clean and bed was very comfortable we would definitely stay here again highly recommended
3120,one of the best locations in no european concept of outdoor open seating we were invited to share a table with a large wedding group of friends and family from around the globe met a great couple from london that shares their contact information for our upcoming trip highly recommended
3121,really good food marred by spotty service would give it 3 5 stars if i could but hoping it was an off night so will go with 4
3122,i totally live in this target is only few minutes away from my house it has everything i need but the only reason why i give it 4 star is because there s is no starbucks but besides that s this is my favorite store
3123,what a gem friendly attentive staff family owned tasty homemade items real crab in the crab and cream cheese wontons they offer beef gyoza along with chicken and pork which were delicious popular with locals too
3124,drinks are amazing and food too we got the tankatsu ramen and ahi tuna poke bowl and pork belly bun or something everything was delish and our server bartender was amazing the place looks really nicw too will def come back
3125,what a great draught house fantastic bartenders who make you feel like you are a regular with a good beer selection and liquor choices
3126,great find we wanted to try something new and had always noticed this restaurant so we made reservations when we arrived we were expecting a bar atmosphere and were delighted to find a very inviting intimate dining room we were sat at a table right next to the large aquarium which turned out to be designed by the creators of tanked it was mesmerizing to watch during our dinner we loved it and all the guy harvey artwork was beautiful we will definitely go back
3127,so my fianc and i decided to stop at golden diner for breakfast today i pass it everyday on my way to work in jersey and saw that it s been making some new renovations and it s still under construction but it seemed presentable enough to provide a decent breakfast we park up with plenty of parking space and go to the entrance that seemed to be only temporary due to renovations we approached the cashier desk as we were waiting to be seated and it didn t take long for the host to recognize some new customers and seat us the host was very friendly and amiable she sat us and took our drink orders we ordered just water to start that was our mistake we didn t realize they serve tap water not filtered tap water but straight tap water i don t want to seem crazy for making this a bigger deal than it is but i don t drink tap water anywhere just because of water contamination and how bad it s become all over the country so bottle water or filtered water is all we and our families drink that would have to be the only downfall about this place that and maybe just making their waitresses seem more welcoming to guests and not just a potential tip the food was great though i ordered the 1 breakfast special and it filled me up perfectly decent price and good food just don t order the water until they start serving filtered water or you re comfortable with exposing yourself to potentially dangerous bacteria
3128,fresh food and amazing service mark was knowledgeable and helpful to this first time visitor everyone on the staff was helpful and accommodating food was plentiful and delicious we had a party of 10 and everyone left happy including our friends who dined on gluten free items spice levels were explained and food came in mild to wonderfully spicy inexpensive for amount and quality of food we will definitely be back
3129,first time here in a long time thought we d give it a shot server was pleasant but service was slow i had the meatball parmigiana with pasta in white sauce my plate was by far the best thing at the table my wife had the roast beef sandwich with mash potatoes it was ok but a bland and not much to talk about my daughters kids cheeseburger meal with fries was good she said overall with the service and food we got gave us the agreed upon rating above
3130,gelato baked goods toasty warm drinks we always stop over after dinner in skippack they have just about every old school candy you think of they have local raw honey and imported candy gelato comes in 12 different flavors fudge cabinet pop rocks candy cigarettes so much i to see and try you need to stop in yourself
3131,what a cool little locals spot and different atmosphere steak was cooked perfect and tasted amazing it is a small place so i would recommend getting there early or making reservations we opted to sit at the bar and eat
3132,i purchased a 2016 nissan from enterprise in august 2017 about 4 months later i learned my windshield was not sealed the manager gave me a hard time but after the repair shop i took my car to told the manager to dig deeper my windshield was fixed on may 30 2018 i was heading home on the interstate and the car just stopped running i quick put my hazard lights on and got out of the car it was 8 minutes after i got out that a driver smashed it why did that car just stopped running i ll never know because it was totaled buyer beware if purchasing from enterprise please do something i didn t do and that s get it check out completely by a certified mechanic you see i counted on their little warranty they offer and also if the sales person ask you more than three times to make the purchase walk away because then their trying to pressure you into buying this was a good lesson for me yet i m glad i got out of that car when i did happy to be alive
3133,we went for brunch on wednesday morning we were seated quickly and our waiter arrived promptly he was in lively spirits which made our dining experience even better the place is small but seemed larger with a wall of mirrors and giant windows letting light in there are several wall air conditioners which caused a background humming noise the noise wasn t horrible and was a welcome respite after the hot and humid outdoors the capuchino was delicious husband ordered shrimp and grits i ordered the 2 egg breakfast our order was quick food was delicious everything was cooked to perfection the shrimp were perfect we decided to split pancakes they literally could melt in you mouth everything was great and exceeded any expectations we will dine here again
3134,great hangout great taps with trivia small food selection off on the edge of town uber to get here not walking to other locations nearby
3135,academy has good prices and a better selection than dicks and this location has much better service than some other city locations that being said i ve encountered both excellent salespeople and some who are rather average this store one of the better places to shop for shoes sports equipment and shooting supplies in the new orleans area and certainly in metairie
3136,yo i just ordered from foods on first today for the first time and like wow i live in university city and i m always on the search for a delicious breakfast spot i ve tried it all but today i chose foods on first via uber eats and it was top notch by far one of the best omelettes and the grits being from florida i m super picky with my grits and they were soooo good thanks for the bomb breakfast
3137,we used to love their pizza but have been seriously disappointed lately the last few pizzas we ve ordered have been super doughy in the middle and undercooked to the point of being mushy think raw biscuit dough even when we ask for well done when we take advantage of their carry out specials we end up putting the pizzas in our over at home to try to finish them off i don t know where the disconnect is between asking for well done and getting underdone pizza but we re now in the market for a new go to pizza option
3138,i called ampm locksmith for my house where i have a very old lock as well as a rental property very professional knows the problem and the solution in a matter of minutes the lock was fixed and replaced damaged parts reasonably priced a true pro
3139,i absolutely love this place the food is always excellent and the service is the best i ve tried several dishes and nothing has disappointed the fish chips might be the best in middle tn pizza is fantastic wings sandwiches all great my favorite is without a doubt the bangers and mash i ve had this dish at several spots but theirs is the best i ve tried they also have great craft beers their fatback amber is amazing but they are all good i highly recommend giving this place a try
3140,it was worth the hype the breakfast was amazing i ordered the catfish eggs and grits the server said i will add a biscuit you don t come here and not get a biscuit real life the biscuit was amazing they are none for their fried chicken so i ordered a wing on the side amazing
3141,what a great find super cute and sooo good traditional eggs benny perfectly cooked egg fresh pressed juice yum
3142,fair pricing and great service prompt and show up when they say they will also super customer service our technician was great and if what they do the first time doesn t fix the problem completely they will come back for free to make sure it s fixed i would definitely recommend this company to anyone needing their ac looked at
3143,great time i loved eating the asian fusion dinner i had the hot pot which is their most popular dish i enjoyed it a lot and took home leftovers you have to mix it which the staff will echo since it comes as a layered sort of dish we sat outside and were comfortable and our waiter came to check on us there wasn t much outdoor lighting which i was surprised about so we re glad we didn t come later the food came hot obviously and was a delicious traditional meal also the bathrooms were pretty clean too unisex single stall bathrooms i will be coming back
3144,you can t go wrong with this place family care love for food so much passion speaks volumes about the workers at this place this will forever be a staple of mine when i need ideas for cooking or baking i hope in the future with the proper training of employees they will open another location
3145,the creole breakfast bowl was absolutely delicious a little bit on the salty side and ask about all the ingredients if you don t eat certain meats bread was fresh will visit again
3146,so much good food to be had it st louis and this was no exception great service delicious food and nice atmosphere
3147,loved the breakfast here i don t think this place needs anymore good reviews because we were there on a cold morning in january and it was packed in fact that s the only thing i didn t love about it it s a bit cramped and noisy and the tables are sort of crammed together in an effort to squeeze in as many eager diners as possible i get it it s the french quarter and most places are on the small side but anyway the food was delicious about as good a breakfast as you re going to find anywhere a bit on the expensive side but i think that s another thing you just have to expect when visiting here great food and good service i ll go back if the line s not too long
3148,once again the red habanero team has exceeded our expectations our meal tasted fantastic and the presentation was very appealing we love the 96 street location and have no problmes driving all the way from greenwood for a visit thank you red habanero for another fantastic experience we will actively see what we can do to help you open another location within greenwood
3149,we went for sunday brunch highly recommended they take reservations which was great for us since we were a group of 7 this was my favorite restaurant in nashville i had the breakfast burrito and i have been craving another one ever since but really i don t think you can go wrong with anything on the menu the service was great a little slow but it was a busy sunday morning i m looking forward to the next time i am in town so i can try it for dinner
3150,was visiting tarpon springs and found this hidden treasure of a restaurant i m a huge fan of poke bowls so when i saw this place i knew i had to give it a try i m glad i did because it was the best meal i had during my week in tarpon springs the ingredients were super fresh and very tasty that people there were very pleasant and welcoming i can t wait to go back
3151,one of my new favorite go to places for authentic mexican food the margaritas are good and the food is absolutely delicious
3152,best breakfast in idaho the most delicious breakfast burrito or breakfast sandwich but also the more traditional breakfasts like eggs benedict are fantastic elegant presentation and everything is made from scratch the charming old building is a fully renovated church cathedral the coffee bar is spot on too you would think it s a dedicated coffee shop
3153,rich and kenny were awesome hilarious guys always fast on checking in but doing it in a really charismatic way the food here is fantastic first stop on the new orleans vacation foodie tour and it did not disappoint do yourselves a favor and order the brussels sprouts
3154,brianna provides the best service to me every night i see her kaela is one of the greatest always look forward to seeing her i keep coming back just because of them nobody else except for jenna boyd i love jenna
3155,made a quick stop in new orleans we re so glad we stopped here for lunch the food was amazing we ordered the crab cake and blacked fish both so fresh and delicious on top of that they had 4 bloody mary s the service was great too very knowledgeable about the food and the history of the building they even shared some ghost stories with us too bad we didn t run into the ghost of antoine after eating we explored the building sat on the balcony upstairs the balcony overlooks jackson square and it s such a beautiful view such a great spot to sit drink and hear live music from the street
3156,the best dessert in the whole world pecan cobbler ice cream on the side get a double scoop and thank me later the steak is good with the garlic potatoes and the wing 5 wing appetizer is whole wings good enough for a meal and definitely to share always had great service although the wait can be a little long best spot after 10 for sure and if simply for the pecan cobbler go
3157,had my brother in law s wedding reception here my sis in law and i went here on the day of the reception and spoke to danny manager i believe we confirmed how the tables were going to be set up and also confirmed the food order there were 42 people that attended and they set up a long table in the back of the restaurant food was delicious service was great
3158,i ve grown up in a lebanese family and we owned a middle eastern restaurant for over 40 years the food is everything to me their food and pleasentries makes me feel like i m at my family s table the smells bring me to sito s grandmother s kitchens this place is a must for truly authentic food and feel of middle eastern culture i ve tried a few in philly none compare
3159,a great atmospheric place to take out of towners for brunch and it s not a tourist trap our meals were scrumptious this place is legit
3160,the hotel is beautiful and clean and the carousel bar is fun my only complaint is that when we realized just how small a fill size bed is there was no option for an additional cot seating was minimal in the room with one chair but we didn t spend a lot of time in the room anyway with so much to do close by the doorman gerald is a gem
3161,it s was okay service was a bit on the interesting side as the person was new food presentation was good though they need to either add rice or more potato salad to the gumbo sprite was flat but i didn t need it anyways
3162,first time ordering takeout from slack s and everyone enjoyed their sandwich it was cheesesteak wednesday and we placed an order for 6 7 chicken and beef cheesteaks and they were very good tons of free toppings to choose from and plenty of cheese but the main star was the roll the roll can make or break a sandwich and these tasted like they were fresh outta the oven delivery took over an hour so order early yum
3163,every time i go this place they are very nice and welcoming i love their food and go there anytime i can amazing service and food i usually get chow mein noodles and they are so good i hope this review is helpful for anyone who is thinking about going here
3164,another local gem i go here for take out at least twice a month they have an indo chinese section in the menu that is amazing it s something i don t always find at indian restaurants i m a veg head i ve not been disappointed by any of the choices so far
3165,the food was good for the most part as always the service was lacking not very busy when we went and it took forever to get our order taken lots of messing around standing around towards the back by the waiters and waitresses
3166,we are from out of state and came here for breakfast loved the location was super cute and quiet we had our breakfast outside near the train tracks the waiter was so nice we had our first beignets and omg i m hooked i m a little bummed that i won t have anymore when i return back to oregon all the food we ordered was simply amazing
3167,the scenery is amazing the bayou is literally right outside and its beautifully chaotic the entrees were amazing we got the bbq shrimp and jalapeo grits and the crab cake lafitte both were amazing the flavor profiles were out of this world i would have given it 5 stars but the bread pudding dessert left something to be desired the entrees were so good it set me up to thinking the dessert would be even better i would definitely recommend and come back
3168,i believe the gentlemen at the front desk name was kris he was great the rain was coming down so hard and he went above and beyond and walked me as well as leo with an umbrella to the car i have taken leonidas there for about two years now unfortunately he is a nervous nelly but we started seeing dr deutsch and he has been the best with leo he is thorough and takes his time to ensure leo is comfy
3169,ihop is the place to go for a family bunch there pancakes are a special recipe there eggs and bacon make the pancakes even better for the grown ups you have a sissy mix of red peppers potatoes bacon and a toasted piece of bread go with your family to ihop
3170,we just had an outstanding meal the spicy chick pea salad started us off and could easily be a meal for one person but of course we kept going the cornbread some of which contained jalapeos was a perfect small dish to go along with our fried chicken quarters that literally fall off the bone we also ordered the duck fried rice which had an amazingly rich flavor that we couldn t save any for tomorrow s leftovers get to this place now before the waiting lines detour you
3171,yelp comes through again reasonable prices huge portions and amazing flavors i got a pulled pork sandwich baked beans and fried okra omg yum
3172,my boyfriend and i had dinner at earl s new american to celebrate our anniversary the staff was very attentive the food was great and the restaurant was very clean ehrin was our waiter and he was wonderful the woman who sat us at our table i didn t catch her name was so sweet and insisted that we take a piece of cake home with us my boyfriend ate the cake when we got home and said it was delicious overall we had a great experience at earl s and would definitely come back
3173,never has a brownie physically and spiritually improved my wellbeing until today not to mention the staff was as delightful as the flavors inside of my mouth i highly recommend
3174,we come here every time we visit st louis great selection fresh and delicious and they open early
3175,i loved my stay here the room service was top notch the view was grade a and the mini bar was stocked with the best stuff too bad the girl i was dating at the time was a total b but that s neither here nor there beautiful atmosphere great location would stay again,this is my go to coffee spot down in the square usually busy but i can find a seat reasonably priced coffee with a distinct flavor friendly young hip staff that doesn t make you feel uncomfortable or unwelcome like some places can love the oat milk love the clean water station and the clean spacious bathroom also the ham and cheese croissant was amazing so close to 5 stars,this is a hidden gem at the 1st floor of an office building not easy to stumble upon but once you do you ll never forget the atmosphere is amazing and the staff is very friendly dan the general manager was very welcoming and accommodating one of the other managers jenny had the best knowledge of gluten free items that i ve ever experienced in a sushi restaurant or any restaurant for that matter my girlfriend has to eat gluten free so that is a huge plus they are also kid friendly and provided fruit and learners chopsticks for the little not so adventurous picky one i have eaten here plenty of times and my favorite rolls are the ai maki and the tropic if you really want to splurge go for the sea bass it melts in your mouth they have a ton of great drinks and a wide selection of sake head bartender andrea puts his heart into every cocktail and strives for perfection and is fun to talk to to top it all off the mochi selection is very extensive and the tempura green tea ice cream is my favorite 5 stars all the way,here s the thing i want so badly to give this place 5 stars i would give it 4 5 if i could but you know how that is i love the food i loved the drinks when i drank and i love the staff the thing is the first time i came here i was an out of towner i was an out of stater to be honest i think maybe it showed and the girl working there didn t seem so friendly we talked a little bit but something seemed off i had the bacon mac and cheese and some good beers so the food and drink were 5 stars i was just a little annoyed by the service well a month later i moved to philly and came back i got the same girl as a bartender and put my best foot forward to be friendly and it paid off probably also helped that i was now a local every time i ve gone since no matter who s working i have a great time the draft selection is pretty nice and the can bottle selection is pretty extensive i had the shrimp etouffe and it was amazing i will admit the menu is sort of small but it works for me i love this place and my stomach is growing just thinking about that etouffe
3176,this place is beautiful they have everything from indoor outdoor plants gifts home decor toys for kids even cute wine in cans emily was fantastic and helped my boys and i choose a gift for my daughter and a variety of plants for our new home she was knowledgeable and thoughtful we appreciate your help emily we will be back in the spring for outdoor plants
3177,we had a wonderful experience last night for our first visit the tuesday tenderloin special brought us in initially our server was great i m not sure i ever caught her name she said she was fairly new but i would have never guessed that my husband had a dragonfly beer i had champagne velvet ale and loved it i m not really even a beer drinker our food came out super fast and those fries so good after discussing different ales our server offered to bring me a sample of one we had debated on so i d know for next time it looks like they have several good specials drinks food and patio music can t wait to go back
3178,horns is the classic new orleans brunch with a killer bloody maria and the best staff would highly recommend the chicken and waffles our waitress was a doll
3179,the fried avacado was surprising choice the flavor is primarily derived from the sauce but still quite good the tuna salad cones with a generous whole tuna steak it was a pleasant surprise to see giant blueberries on the accompanying salad as i wasn t expecting it in february not too crowded for lunch service was attentive and am sorry i can t remember our servers name as she was delightful
3180,the fish tacos were great they were perfectly fried and crispy the service was also great especially our waitress donna whether you are just taking a day trip to the beach or staying in the tradewinds hotel this is a great place for lunch or dinner
3181,prep and pasty is an amazing place for breakfast i have not tried their lunch items but i can only assume they re amazing as well all the food is excellent and it should go without saying that you have to try a pastry at least once the manager is probably hands down the best one i ve seen at a restaurant very personal and friendly and always going above and beyond only downside is the wait if you arrive anytime after 8 00 or so you ll be looking at a 15 30 minute wait even more so on the weekends totally worth it to put your name on the waitlist here on yelp and come around the time it says your table will be ready otherwise totally amazing restaurant
3182,i was excited to try oliver s as their are not many vegan restaurants in the area the service was stellar and the food delicious and fresh my wine selection of sauvignon blanc was bright and crisp not a single disappointment with our experience
3183,going to dr clarke is a pleasure his friendly staff is there to assist in any way to make your appointment enjoyable he has the top of the line equipment that makes his job much easier quicker with much less pain he is a good communicator and very adept at doing root canals i felt quite comfortable with dr clarke the pictures he takes of your tooth teeth are spectacular i would not hesitate recommending him to my friends
3184,i m updating a previous 1 star review in july 2018 approximately 3 months after my order final gravity shipped my beer kits i haven t had a chance to brew them yet but everything looks good i can t give 5 stars as the shipment time was excessive and communication was insufficient but they are a honorable business and did take care of my order
3185,ventured out in the cold today and figured i would try this truck since the line was pretty short and usually there s a bit of a wait i was not disappointed he gave everyone a cup of the warm sauce to sip on while we waited also shout out to cvs for allowing us to wait in their atrium and not kicking us out the sauce was gingery and spicy and fresh the chicken is grilled and has a nice smokey flavor and the falafel is probably the the best i ve ever had the dish also came with blackberries and grapes which i thought was odd but when you ate it all combined in the dish it was actually really delicious i went with a friend who also really liked it but the sauce did get a little too spicy for her after a while but i loved it i used to live in portland or and there is a pretty famous thai chicken and rice truck there where she makes one dish and one dish only the owner even did a ted talk her idea was to make one dish and only make that one dish really really well this truck is sort of the same deal with some small variations
3186,this is for the lunch counter for 7 i got very good pollo rojo mexican rice and refried beans and corn tortillas the only downside is that it s steam table and to go so by the time you get home you ll have to heat it up but it s better than many of the authentic mexican restaurants around town i ll be back
3187,what a great event the vendors were so generous with their portions so much food wine and liquor great day and so organized saaca did a great job
3188,very chill place in a lazy part of mid town plenty of indoor outdoor space good menu great spot any time of the day
3189,beautiful beach with clear warm water and white sand lots of shells to look for the beach was very remote and quiet the beach area is small but very nice
3190,full disclosure my experience might just have been an isolated rare occurrence i arrived to the brick and sat myself at the bar after 15 minutes of zero service i was getting ready to leave but i noticed the waiting staff on the main floor looked active and on top of things i decided to transition from the lack of service bar to the main floor and literally as soon as i sat down i had a waiter hand me a menu take my drink order and before even a blink i had a bloody mary in front on me moral of this story careful sitting at the bar since the service there seemed to be lacking i m sure it was the timing since my overall experience was a thumbs up i ordered the loaded bloody mary the drink was simple but very delightful clearly proving that less is more the drink had a little satisfying kick that s normal to any bloody mary overall very satisfied with their bloody mary so much in fact i ordered two maybe a little more body to it but not a must food i ordered the tuna blt with the side of asian slaw overall great the theme here is clearly simple they exploit every taste which is gratifying since that s the most important thing the slaw was crisp and surprisingly very refreshing now the tuna can only be described as crafted by a masterful craftsman yes i said it it tasted better than it looked and that s hard todo since it looked as if out of a magazine nothing but quality dining i place four starts because of the first part of my experience but other than that it was a good experience and i i ll come to the brick again
3191,i just went through the drive through i haven t been there in a very long time they were very accommodating excellent service and the food is great
3192,75 for one hour is pretty steep to stay fully dressed and just be massaged over your clothes in an open room but my therapist was very thorough we also did the 12 for 20 minute foot massage which the first few minutes were great but then she just kept rubbing the same spot over and over again and was starring out into the distance so i would say ok experience
3193,i m an indian american i know spice so i eat here often tried curry chicken and rice jollof rice they re all spicy and great flavor their hot tea is amazing owner is great,had their jollof rice and lamb it was so flavorful and amazing can t wait to go back their home made hot sauce was amazing too but ask for it on the side parking across the street in a lot i paid 2 for about an hour not bad
3194,great happy hour and quizzo fun on a sunday funday jaime was our bartender and she rocks a busy bar definitely coming back i didn t eat but i smelled and saw the food around me and i can t wait to try it
3195,wife and i got the eggs benedict i am an eggs benedict lover i ll admit it whoever first decided to put together poached eggs english muffins canadian bacon and a creamy leaning sauce called hollandaise is a genius this eggs benedict didn t disappoint the english muffins was crunchy but not over toasted the eggs were poached perfect the canadian bacon was done solidly and the hollandaise a homerun we also both got grits i thought they were great the ride thought a shade bland i ll go with her assessment as she is from the south and so am a transplant it is a bit pricey 42 for two but we were staying at the royal sonesta so it was convenient
3196,this business went out of their way to help us with our order i ordered a build your own bowl and while all the ingredients were very fresh and good they accidentally forgot to put sauce in the bowl i called to let them know it was missing and the owner was very apologetic and offered to re make whatever we needed and added 2 aa bowls for the hassle excellent customer service which can be hard to find sometimes we loved the miso and green goddess sauce the aa bowls were also to die for will definitely be back to this place on a regular basis
3197,great job on my fill and gel pedicure even though it was close to closing they took their time and even accommodated every request i had i m very particular clean environment and very friendly staff way more than i could have expected for a nail salon in a mall p s my foot and hand massages afterwards were heavenly i will definitely be back
3198,first time i ve been in eegee s in a couple of years i live within the mile there were a lot of cars in the drive thru so they must know something we went in i ordered pastrami my husband ordered a meatball sandwich and i have to tell you it was great the pastrami was lean it wasn t fatty i m glad i gave it another shot it is right in our neighborhood and we weren t going to go back because i got a fatty pastrami today it was perfect
3199,where do i start i visited with a friend in january when it was still glam holiday decor and it was just stunning i did make a reservation online which is an awesome feature i did notice when we left that there were many people up front waiting for a table i do think that in such a beautiful location and an establishment that offers drinks food and the primary focus of desserts it is smarter to plan ahead and reserve your spot my friend and i started with the white wedding tea which came by recommendation from our server in a really cutesy uniform in a gorgeous teapot and it was perfect for sharing i d say that we both were able to get about 2 or 3 cups each the tea itself was surprisingly delicious i m more of a coffee drinker but the bakery really makes you feel like you re there for a tea party so you feel inclined to partake haha additionally we both got the pink passion sparkling which was also fantastic and garnished with a rose petal which makes it feel extra special for lunch i had the jam rosemary quiche and arugula salad which was delicious but i was definitely having envy over my friends three cheese cavatappi basically a grown up fancy macaroni and cheese and will 100 be my order next time for dessert i had the raspberry champagne cake and she ordered the red velvet no envy there because my piece was incredible seriously i m still dreaming about when i ll have my next one i took my husband home a piece of gwendolyn s famous earl s court chocolate cake i can t say how that tasted because i swear i didn t take a bite before i gave it to him it was really good because we simply couldn t be stopped we also each had a rose macaron and that was weird i ve never had a macaron and i ve never eaten a rose before but it tasted like bubblegum and was really chewy it seemed like it was right and i could be tempted to have another overall it was a 10 10 experience i would highly recommend visiting it isn t necessarily just the cake that makes your visit it is a true experience i ve kept up with the instagram account and the thought and time she puts into the decor is so special and you can feel the heart in the cake bake shop ps even the salt is pink
3200,barb gave me a great precision cut it falls into place very nicely when i style it would highly recommend,barbara p is a great stylist takes the time to give a very precise styled cut highly recommend
3201,my best friend and i got an airbnb in the area and this place was suggested to us by the owner we loved it so much we went twice on our trip ambience is amazing outdoor patio with jazzy vibes and dim lit lighting it was our first taste of new orleans and it didn t disappoint we chose 2 bottles of italian wine and did a cheese board so good definitely suggest going here
3202,the swamp tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip to new orleans the swamp was beautiful and so relaxing i felt like i stepped into another world we saw gators hogs birds and there was no bugs or mosquitos captain tom was funny and informative don t forget to bring your camera and try to sit on either end of the boat for best picture taking seats
3203,from the front bacchanal looks like a regular old wine store you step inside and see tons of wine bottles and a small refrigerated section you can choose your cheese wine cured meats and then pay up front they ll bring it out to you then you step through the back door of the wine store into a massive backyard with mood lighting ambiance heated tables and live music we absolutely loved the ambiance outside despite the colder than usual nola temperatures there is also an upstairs which was packed good vibe as well but outside is where it s at we will definitely come back this was a top 3 favorite spot on my trip
3204,this farmer s market is my favorite because there is so much to do they have live music a big fountain and two playgrounds for the kids to play plenty of picnic area around and a large variety of local vendors with quality seasonal offerings flowers breads cheeses honey microgreens breakfast lunch tea salsa meats and so much more
3205,so happy to know they have a new location on waters ave in town n country went there for the first time today and everything was delicious as it always is at their other location the meat in the pastor tacos was tender and savory and my vuelve a la vida was amazing i ordered a small and there was so much shrimp fish and octopus i had a hard time finishing it they also have indoor seating with 5 tables and cold a c will definitely be a repeat customer for years to come
3206,this place is amazing i come here all the time and it is the best starbucks location in new orleans my order always comes out fast so it s perfect if i m in a rush the workers are very friendly and it s squeaky clean there are normally lots of seat available i usually come around 5 pm and it s rarely crowded it s perfect for your afternoon coffee the only bad thing is the parking parking in this area is not the easiest to find and they do not offer parking
3207,excellent cafe i had the crab omelet and it was too die for my daughter had the breakfast burrito and she totally loved it my husband had banana foster french toast and he was literally licking the plate great service and very friendly staff,excellent pizza love the fact that you can add additional items to your pizza if you wish staff is very friendly and efficient if you love pizza like i do this is the place to come
3208,i ordered to go for lunch and was expecting more from all the yelp reviews but it was just ok the roti was good but not thicker than normal broth and i got the char kway teow which wasn t overly spicy at all it was rather dry with only three small shrimps and a few pieces of calamari their portions were small and probably would not order again with other places in chinatown that can make the same meal for less
3209,reservations recommended great atmosphere and wonderful service i love their unique spin on island seafood
3210,first let me say that i m a server so i don t often post reviews and tend to be fairly lenient when i do i understand restaurants can be chaotic and there are often very legitimate reasons that an experience at a restaurant isn t the one you imagined that said i also know that if i wasn t a server as all my guests weren t this review would likely not be even three stars first i decided to take a group of nine people here for a celebratory dinner recently it s a large group so i understand that this isn t an easy feat i ve been in the server s shoes before myself but of course i chose ralph s because quite a few of my friends lifelong philly residents suggested it as the type of place that could deal with this very well we were seated on the second level in a space that is gorgious and very well maintained room food was okay very traditional american italian fare i had no problems with it at all i wouldn t say it s pushing the culinary envilope but it tasted good and ultimately that s what we all wanted where i take issue is with the service interestingly it appears all large groups are seated on the second level obviously working in the business i know this is a bad idea especially in such an old building with loud accoustics it just means you are gonna have a lot of people all trying to talk we were seated right next to a group of 8 9 people which in turn was seating in front of 10 12 people kept coming and going us and our neighbors tried to be respectful the third table in the room included multiple people who were screaming and laughing at a redicules volume i couldn t even talk to my uncle across the table from me maybe 3 feet away from me at max at times i understand that servers are often expected to put up with whatever and never ever suggest patrons are in the wrong but i also know that part of the job is being able to politely suggest a table refrain from screaming at the table especially if they are clearly bothering the other tables in the room service was also rather odd there were two servers that were servicing the whole room but there was no rhyme or reason behind the service one took the drink order another the food order and after that i had to get up and talk to them if i wanted anything else i get that only three of use were drinking my parents don t drink my grandmother is in her late 80s and doesn t drink my aunt is an ex alcoholic etc so we weren t really the cash cow they thought when they saw a 9 person reservation coming in it still ticked me off especially when i had to get up and find our servers not once but twice within half an hour of finishing the main course so we could get dessert menus and then again so we could order dessert i would have talked to a manager but by the end of it all my guests were rather embarrassed because they felt incredibly out of place honestly they are really amazing people who did not even want me to go to a server when we had a mix up on the order but while i have a lot of patience as a two year vet of the industry when that runs dry i find poor service to be grating this is a novel but as a server i hope management can use it to look at their policies and training and i hope other guests can use it to see what the experience can be like as i said i would rate the food a 4 5 and am not against perhaps visiting again provided with a smaller group preferably downstairs if others suggest it but i m certainly not rushing back or encouraging my friends to book large tables there
3211,brought my vehicle in for service my car was completed sooner than expected and the staff was very friendly i ll be taking my vehicles here from now on highly recommend
3212,i recently relocated from nyc to nashville and was not sure what i was going to get when changing dentists dr harris came highly recommended to me and even then exceeded my expectations starting from the moment i walked in i was greeted by a very friendly and professional front desk staff the office itself is gorgeous and very conveniently located in the gulch i was seen straight away and had one of the best cleanings after the cleaning dr harris met with me and did a throurough inspection he asked me about any concerns i had and we discussed some cosmetic work that i had been considering dr harris was very professional and did not try and sell me anything that i did not need was not looking for he has vast knowledge and state of the art technology i look forward to my next consultation visit
3213,when i went to new orleans this was my single favorite attraction i know it s odd but i love cemetaries especially old ones it started when i was a kid seeing which headstones were the oldest was something i loved to do it poured down rain as we got close to st louis cemetary 1 and by the end of the tour boyfriend and i were soaked with an umbrella but i couldn t have been happier i really enjoyed the tour and the stories about the cemetery itself imagine dead bodies floating around town and stories of those who were laid to rest there and nicholas cage who has his pyramid that doesn t at all belong anyhow it was fantastic definitely do this tour if your into cemetaries it history and get your two free drinks before you leave the bar
3214,best taco place i ever been to in philadelphia malvern very authentic tasting and the meat is marinated and juicy steak can be a bit dry but still very good in my opinion the serving size and price are unmatchable and don t get me started about the sauces they keep them refrigerated till you sit at the table i could drink it straight that s how good it is
3215,brian was our tour guide and he was so much fun very knowledgeable about the history of new orleans and had a great sense of humor much smaller than the other tours going on around us which made for a more intimate experience he made sure that the group was away from the larger groups so that we could hear what he was saying he was very receptive to questions and allowed us to stop along the way and take pictures it was a really fun time
3216,food was pretty good i m more of a flour tortilla guy but even though i had a corn tortilla it was still pretty good
3217,i project that this time next year the line will be down the block to get a table in this new fantastic restaurant if you are seeking italia look no farther started with calamari and bruschetta just like capri s gemma then pizza margarita better than johns in nyc steak blue and ravioli housemade veal parmesan was out of this world diego our waiter from naples will lead you to heaven in this fantastic establishment
3218,alan his wife run the cleanest friendliest nail salon in the area they are so wonderful artistic and thorough my daughter and i love them we recommend to all oh did i mention great prices too especially early in the week they are open every day just the best manis pedis everything else they do try em out
3219,wow incredibly delicious we explored many items on the menu and adored everything the lamb melted in your mouth as the flavors exploded the drinks were interesting and service was timed perfectly the restaurant has a wonderful energy our server heather was outstanding friendly and fun the manager stopped by our table for a delightful conversation each employee who poured water or cleaned the table was pleasant and smiling overall a perfect meal we can t wait to go back
3220,thanks for the previous reviews are they nuts this place continues to be fantastic great burgers and wonderful gumbo and babs the bartender is a real kick try this place you ll love it
3221,the pizza was awesome i really liked the dough it was so good i gave it a 4 star because i didn t care for the hot wings they had some sort of dry rub on them and not a sauce i was literally burping up all the spices from it definitely would go back for the pizza though
3222,saw the st louis social club at this bar they were amazing and i hope they come back to sb,fantastic place and worth the long wait line to get in not your normal affair which i like
3223,best prime rib i ve ever had and best carrot cake i ve ever had regardless of restaurant skip the seafood tower it s a trap fantastic food here folks
3224,great shop very clean and efficient had links taken out of a watch here they were really easy job was done early and to perfection i will be back in the future
3225,had the spinach crabmeat bisque chicken rosamarino and the linguini al fruitti di mare fradiavolo everything was cooked perfectly and very delicious waiter friendly and attentive cute little place must make reservation
3226,one could easily miss seeing nam kitchen express tucked away in the strip malls beside t t at north gate center it s a small restaurant with limited seating but packs big vietnamese flavor from the pho to vermicelli bowls to the fried noodles nam kitchen express has tasty authentic vietnamese dishes for a great price servings are very generous i ordered the special noodle bowl for takeout and i could hardly finished have the bowl the green onion cakes are also a nice treat light and crispy it s defiantly not a place to eat if you re looking for an ambient atmosphere or stellar service but you can t go wrong if you re looking for some genuine vietnamese food
3227,love our new favorite local spot we ve gone a few times since they opened and it s always a good ambiance and great food the drinks are great the salsa is super yummy and the salads are very much entree sized bring your friends sit outside grab a margarita and enjoy
3228,great ball park nice short porch in right for some home run fun went on a friday and got to enjoy mcfaddens pub which is attached to the park as well as a visit to the diamond club good food beer and baseball cbp has it all
3229,went here for breakfast for the first time i recommend making a reservation we didn t realize that we were supposed to and almost didn t get in it was so busy it took about an hour to get the food had to prompt a staff member to bring the bill and then even waited and no one brought a machine or even asked if i needed one so i had to go to the front and ask if i could pay my bill they seemed a bit disorganized and unprepared on the upside the food is fresh and delicious i had the omelette with shredded duck mushrooms and gruyere cheese so good i would go back just to have that again my boyfriend ordered their wakey wakey eggs and bacey and he ate everything on his plate the bacon and ham were cooked to perfection and the scrambled eggs were nice and fluffy lesson learned make a reservation and try not to go during peak times
3230,a friend of mine and i had dinner few nights ago and was really impressed we ordered quite a bit everything we tried was fantastic must try if you re looking for me benihana style restaurant in santa barbara,probably best place in town for crabs small but food is on point a must try if your ever in the area
3231,spontaneous stop for dinner samosa for a shared appetizer lamb curry and a delicious vegan entree perfect rice and spice good wine selection and pours
3232,have heard great things but wasn t as good as anticipated my burger was over cooked over handled in the making which made the burger chewier than should be wide selection of sauces and burgers but frankly i think i prefer the flavor and texture of steak and shake
3233,it s great vegetarian food every time best indian food in delaware love the spices the dal tadka and mattar paneer are my favorites they also have great sauces and appetizers it s a very casual eat in restaurant so we often get ours to go
3234,delicious food excellent customer service their original house made dim sum sauce goes well with everything we were walking around before we had to pickup our car and decided to stop in for lunch the establishment small but now crowded or uncomfortable highly recommended
3235,overall a very nice place better than the other woodhouses i have been too the men side shower is nice and the communal waiting room was a great place to relax the massage was strong as an ox and i didn t get a hot stone massage that i asked for so little disappointed there but it was good
3236,new orlean s best restaurant hands down scotty crew kill it best chargrilled oysters out there amongst every other dish on the menu the ribs are a must
3237,wow nice this place is an old school white table cloth italian restaurant not only is the bar well stocked the wine list is vast and the menu has everything you would expect very nice atmosphere and great service i recommend to anyone in nashville looking for a nice dinner at a traditional restaurant,the bar in this place is amazing very cool location with an outstanding wait staff the food is amazing we have been here several times and have always left full we are constantly impressed with their wine selection as well it stays current with many great vineyards on their list however good our feedback is that they are limits on space and are not set up well for parties larger than 8 we were able to squeeze 10 into their largest table but were challenged for space throughout the dinner overall a great experience will return just with a smaller group
3238,i m a little late to the party and have been meaning to stop by yelo d since it opened but didn t have the chance until this past weekend it certainly did not disappoint i stopped in after work and it was a little bit of a rainy day so there wasn t a line i tried the halo halo and had the ube keso flavour swirl but you can also just choose a single flavour ube is one of my favourite flavours so i never pass up on that when given the chance the flavour wasn t overly subtle and just perfect and the leche flan that was also included as part of the toppings was a really nice addition while i was there i also stopped into pick up 4 pints as part of the crowd funding i had supported months prior one of the owners came out to help us select the 4 pints he gave us samples of each of the flavours on tap to help us make our decision when we told him this was our first time in yelo d he was super friendly and genuinely cared about providing a great experience and one of the reasons why i love supporting local businesses there are usually 4 flavours on tap and are rotated every so often if you re looking to purchase a pint however they may have additional flavours tucked away in their fridge so definitely worth asking about if you re looking for a flavour they previously had that may no longer be on tap we ended up picking up buko ube pandan keso super excited to try out these flavours at home the shop is super colorful cute and really cozy there are a few benches outside for you to enjoy your soft serve ice cream and the menu is displayed on the wall which is great so you can easily ponder your options while waiting in line and don t have to play the squinting game they also had some cookies pies pandesal buns and a few other items which i will have to go back and try at a later date i really liked how everything in the shop the soft serve and baked treats had filipino asian flavours definitely something a bit different and unique if you haven t stopped in yet they are definitely worth a visit and you won t be disappointed
3239,never gets old i get the chocolate malt with light on the chocolate best ice cream custard thing i have ever had in my life
3240,hits and misses but honestly i come for the ambience and vibes also the fries are good and it s a awesome place to chill
3241,very helpful and friendly i just moved into a new apartment a d i had a flea problem they were very knowledgeable and quick they stay open pretty late too i will continue to shop here for my pet from now on
3242,this is a great mexican restaurant if you re looking for something a little different i love the chorizo queso i have also had their sweet chili wings and churros both were really good the one downside is that it is pretty pricey otherwise it s a great place to eat
3243,classic mexican place meat was good and guacamole did not cost extra comparable to chipotle but i think it was a little better the music was too loud when i was there but that is my only complaint
3244,the budlight tour was 11 and included 2 beer samples a bottle to take home and a beer at the end definitely worth the price for all that we go to see and do this tour got to see a variety of steps in the brewing and bottling process as well as see hear about the history of the buildings and the architecture would definitely come to do again when great destination for when friends and family visit
3245,the service was friendly and quick and the balcony was nice the food was just ok i m not sure i d go back it was forgettable

3247,atmosphere is casual indoor and outdoor seating service was good i had garlic parmesan wings they were good but a little greasy
3248,update at bottom the first time i came here it was really good the staff was nice and the food was really good but the last time i came i went with my boyfriend and i had a bad experience with one of the staff members we went up to pay with cash and the guy didn t even want to take our order he asked someone else to he took one look at us and i could tell he was upset when he called out our number we didn t hear him the first time and he got really angry when we got up there he was pissed and one of his co workers said why are you getting upset over just one ticket i really don t want to assume it could ve been anything maybe it was because we re an interracial couple maybe it was because my bf is a little older than me maybe it was because my bf is a dwarf or maybe he was just having a bad day again i don t want to assume so i m going to go with a bad day he was mean but the food was still good update the owner reached out to me and has informed me that this employee has been let go please don t be turned off by this review because most of the people are so nice and the food is really good you get a lot of bang for your buck as well

3250,great staff and good food make sure you get the buffalo chicken cheese steak with fries it ll knock you socks off
3251,great atmosphere very chill tapas place with intimate live music the drinks were well balanced though i think they cheaped out on the tequila in their margarita duck crostini was so good that we ordered a second portion when we were done kale salad was decent pork belly was not too good saw another table send back gumbo surprising amount of negative in this review but it was a solid experience
3252,this a great moroccan restaurant in philly very authentic food and atmosphere set course menu with large portions great for a group
3253,my driver michael s was awesome i had a pickup on fort myers beach to southwest florida international airport on jan 5 michael was 10 minutes early courteous polite and was such a hoot to talk to he made me feel comfortable as i was traveling alone to meet my husband at the airport thanks so much michael from jim cantore s cousin amy cantore lololol
3254,it wont blow u away but it s a decent lunch spot u wont have anything undercooked the sesame bread is pretty good i recommend sticking with egg drop soup unless you are used to the flavors of the other two option between white and brown rice i feel like they missed out on the opportunity to have fried rice as an option overall i enjoyed it
3255,food was delicious recommend going in during lunch time parking was still kinda packed but sushi was not that bad,this was the first place i went for restaurant week and oh my god the food was delicious the space within the restaurant was small but cute
3256,as a three year going on four member of newfields formerly the ima i can honestly say that i will never get bored of visiting this campus whether it be frolicking through the formal gardens or taking a seat in front of a painting and pondering the artist s decision in using that certain color of paint i have never been disappointed in any of my number of visits to newfields i recently took a group of my friends who had never been before to explore the campus and it was the perfect sunny day for it we began on the top floor with the contemporary galleries and worked our way down and outside to the beautifully kept gardens the newly renovated design gallery was outstanding and so much better organized and presented than how it formerly was from experiencing a virtual reality tour of the miller house and gardens to immersing yourself into the design process everything was beautifully done i even got to make a prototype of a toaster i think a key benefit that i experience is the amount of things to do there are three galleries that are always filled with rotating exhibits so every season brings about new artwork while summer wonderland may have just finished the new galleries featuring george platt lynes and the year of japan are about to open later in the fall also one of the docents told me that the curatorial staff changes out paintings every week so there really is something new to be seen on each visit i would highly recommend visiting newfields if you are visiting indy it is definitely worth your time and finances if you are an indy local it is definitely worth the membership plus if you are a butler university student you get a free membership with your student id
3257,love their food my husband was not into sushi until trying it here now this is our go to spot on a regular basis
3258,got a groupon for andre richard salon and had an amazing haircut and overall experience everyone here was very friendly offering to take my coat and offer a beverage right when i walked in the door the stylist aytekin was on time and gave me a fabulous cut he immediately understood the kind of cut i wanted long hair with lots of short layers and confirmed confirming that it will fit in a ponytail confirmed i didn t want v shaped layers etc and offered suggestions throughout such as shaping around my face and how to style i walked away with the best haircut i ve ever had it s clear aytekin is a professional the way he curled my hair with only a brush and hairdryer was amazing turns out he had spent years cutting hair in europe philly should be glad to now have aytekin with andre richard salon
3259,the food here was great we came for brunch on a thursday only waited about 45 minutes for a table our server was very nice although i don t remember her name thank you for your help katie the manager was also very kind and helpful we were seated outside after a crazy rain it was still clean dry beautiful on their patio the food was soooo good there was a little confusion about table numbers when our food and drinks were delivered multiple times but that s no big deal we are in town for my best friends bachelorette party we would definitely return to milk honey
3260,we rented a house with them for nearly three years sarah our leasing agent was easy to work with and quick to respond the portal to pay rent was easy to use our maintenance requests were responded to in an appropriate amount of time including when our ac went out on a friday at 4pm with a 4 day old baby and someone cane that evening i was anxious about move out after reading some reviews but we didn t have any issues
3261,10 10 the hawaiian flatbread is amazing pineapple does go on pizza my boyfriend got the gripper sandwich with buffalo mac and cheese that has amazing flavors cheap good drinks long happy hour 11 7 what more could you ask for i would recommend for a drink or dinner with family either way it s delicious
3262,such a hidden find in downtown indy came across this place while walking to bankers life and decided to stop here for a quick bite they are known for pizza obviously but i tried their pasta and although it was subpar their caesar salad was quite good warning it is served with olives which is unusual but i picked them off the pasta seemed like it had a little too much butter and it comes with really yummy bread the service was just okay very quick and polite i see myself coming back to try the pizza that everyone in the restaurant seemed to have as well as their shrimp alfredo flatbread that sounded delicious
3263,i ve been remiss in reviewing our tour with ernie in january 2018 we went on the st louis cemetery tour with our son daughter in law and two grandsons 8 and 10 he kept all of us enthralled with funny stories and deep knowledge of history of neworleans he knows his stuff don t miss an opportunity to take this tour
3264,always great service when we come never let s us down the food is great we love the pizzokie
3265,lauren made my hair look stunning i really could not have done it myself at home it was beautiful and she was wonderful and friendly will be going back asap
3266,if you go to new orleans this place is a must enjoy great music really cool atmosphere and when you notice that is nothing electronic in there is definitely a mind blowing feeling like a time machine
3267,everything i have had so far is delicious as soon as you walk in your mouth will start watering because of the smells and spices that fills the restaurant you can also order online and orders are ready to be picked up on time or sooner
3268,awesome place very dope setting large party can crash and chill staff here super nice i broke a glass of a beer and they hooked me one for free without even hesitation awesome great place great beer thanks all the staff for great hospitality
3269,we stayed here for a girls trip last weekend and couldn t have been happier it was nice not to be at a large hotel with countless guests this was more low key and casual we met many other guests and made friends over the few days we were there chris the bartender is fun and the pool is a great gathering spot
3270,i would have to skip this one on my next trip it was a wednesday night that was not busy first when i arrived there was a gentleman who approached me and said remember to take care of me and tip me on your way out i wasn t sure what he meant as he didn t do anything second i ve been eating my way through the area and i found it odd that i was asked if i had a reservation the food was good but nothing worth coming back for the oysters were average the brussel sprouts were good and the fried fish was good too lol beware the menu does say fried lemon that seems to blend with the fried fish yes i ate a whole fried lemon slice thinking it was the fish the odd guy from ealier actually worked here cleared one dish from my table and wanted me to tip him it was a very uneasy dining here for many reasons happy eating
3271,clean and modern facility went in with 3 other friends and they accommodated us immediately calming music playing in the background and skilled massage staff great bang for your buck if you re looking to walk in
3272,excellent insurance agent offers personalized options with trusted carriers melissa is in expert in all lines of insurance and truly cares about her clients
3273,great place highly recommend it to anyone saw the john zarsky quartet the tradestars there they are fantastic if you get a chance to see them drinks are good too lol not your everyday bourbon street dive bar bartenders are great don t forget to tip your bar staff and the band
3274,3 5 we came for brunch recently i had the chicken and waffles the prices here are generally pretty reasonable so i was surprised that this dish was 16 however upon reading the menu i realized this is because it s an entire half chicken i didn t want that much food so i asked if i could have a half order i was able to get a quarter chicken white for 10 which was the perfect amount of meat for me they did however only give me half a waffle which was a little less than i would have liked and waffle batter is dirt cheap so i think it would be nice if they give you a whole waffle even with the half chicken order i thought the chicken was only average the waffle was probably better than average my husband had a fried chicken sandwich and said it was decent but a bit bland i d say 3 5 stars for food but am rounding up because the service was really friendly and prompt we were seriously in and out in about 30 minutes which was appreciated because we had our infant daughter with us and she started fussing near the end of the meal fortunately the restaurant is pretty loud and no one seemed to notice or care this is the kind of place we d undoubtedly come back to if we lived close by but i don t think it s worth a special trip
3275,you just can t pass this up very neat all ages incredible musicians definitely make it part of your no trip,first time in and they were great gel manicure and pedi got me in right away and even fixed my toes a day later that had that had smudged will come back for sure very nice
3276,our breakfast here was great i had the black bean cake benedict which was sooooo good and tried the blackberry grits which were yum my husband enjoyed his omelette and the pancakes looked amazing service was quick and people were friendly i would go back
3277,overpriced and understaffed let start with giant stores always have all the items and stock you need but at what cost a great cost i find giant stores merchandise is cat least 3 5 higher than other stores in the area acme is a very close second if you shop after 8pm it s very hard to find associates to help you locate items or answer questions on the up side the deli items are reasonably priced and fresh but beware of the seafood as it s not always the freshest in a pinch i shop here for instance on the way to work and i need to bring the drinks or dessert this market would not be the preferred place for my personal or family shopping but it s clean well lit and stocked
3278,a lil cozy bar restaurant on frenchman street small plates good music and service
3279,i like this spot always quick and the servers are nice i ve never sat down inside and eaten as to i prefer to get carry out but they are always courteous and prompt with my order the inside is always full with people eating there buffet which all i hear is it is great you can never go wrong with super china buffet
3280,the setting is very interesting and reminded me of a mexican restaurant bar area music and ambiance however the food really does justice and there were plenty to choose from i was craving for dinuguan and although it was cooked well i was expecting the traditional sour taste the bicol express was both sweet and spicy which was a good combination if you are craving for filipino food this place will suffice
3281,we had a wonderful dinner tonight we seriously considered not eating here due to the negative reviews when we got here we saw how full the parking lot was and wondered why so busy and so many people here surely would not be as popular if the reviews were true we waited at the bar for a table the bar tender was a delight and all smiles we missed our table call because we didn t hear them at the bar when we inquired the hostess couldn t apologize enough and we were seated shortly again with many apologizes our waiter jordan was pleasant helpful and accommodating with our dietary requirements meal came in a reasonable time cooked to our order our tea was always full and our dishes cleared without our being aware i guess those that posted negative reviews clearly had expectations out of the ordinary we will be back
3282,been coming here for months and between the beer down to earth awesome waiters and incredible beers this has been one of my favorite places for a while the black bean burger here is incredible i wouldnt call it the best in town just yet but i did drive out of the way to come here just to have it if your an ipa person you have to stop by for the dragon fly which is on tap year around every sunday when they have 3 pints we drive up here from south indy just for the dragonfly burger combo and now that its warmer outside the outdoor seating really tops it all off lets not leave out the free wifi
3283,i had the crab enchiladas and though they were good there were a lot of shells in the meat my wife had fish taco and veggies and she liked hers alot
3284,great food and great service highly recommend this place for great bbq ribs are really good burnt ends are great and highly recommend the brisket
3285,the happy hour menu is wonderful if you appreciate a great shaved prime rib sandwich 12 and top notch burger 8 with wi cheddar and bacon both come with fries and all the fixings the selection of happy hour special handcrafted cocktails is also excellent and delicious the door was opened for us as we approached with a friendly welcome the service was outstanding and the bar area is very comfortable asked us if we were celebrating anything and we were their for my wife s birthday a lovely box of chocolate truffles hand made in the restaurant was brought out for her and even took a picture of us and put it in a frame treated just the way you would want
3286,this is one of the best experiences i have had in an extended stay america motel the manager comped my room for a minor mishap and i stayed another night there was a broken drawer in the nightstand and the shower curtain was hung too high like a lot of hotels i have been in and that sent water all over the floor but the staff made up for all of that i would recommend this motel again
3287,i ve been going to ly for almost 3 years now and wouldn t go to any other nail tech anywhere she s an amazing nail tech as well as the others working in the salon i highly recommend everyone best quality work for a great price too my nails have lasted me 7 weeks before
3288,kft was great perfect size for an indulgence without getting stuffed fries are some of the best i have had in cc nice and browned and not grease laden
3289,very impressed my first time to pizza hut in tucson daniel the mgr greeted us immediately upon eye contact very friendly and efficient thank you
3290,the crappy indiana roads blew one of my tires on my cts on i465n i was able to drive to them and they changd my tire at 11 pm at night in no time thanks guys
3291,great service by lety and atmosphere glad to know they have gluten free bread loved the beach bowl with hoison sauce couple of suggestions keep the salt seasoning off fries and add grass feed beef to the menu i m sure customers such as myself would pay more for that option
3292,they have an awesome happy hour we got the chicken strips and mini burgers and sw au gratin potatoes which are to die for martini were also good and had a great price
3293,the technician was knowledgeable polite and professional with my refrigerator repair i will definitely be using mr appliance again for all my repairs
3294,just went to burger up for the first time and i will definitely be back no wait time at all very modern interior fantastic service and even better food every employee i spoke to was incredibly nice the food was amazing and the price was much lower than i expected 100 recommend burger up
3295,a menu that satisfies everyone s cravings clean trendy and delicious i definitely recommend going early before 9 am as the wait tends to get longer after 9 am but honestly it is soooo worth the wait you will leave there feeling so incredible satisfied,great service and super fast lots of options on the menu including a gluten free and vegetarian options shakes are amazing and burgers are to die for very friendly staff and great and clean environment with a nice nashville vibe
3296,i ve been here on the east coast and am thrilled they re open in tucson the cookies are warm and soft ice cream is rich and creamy this is a great spot to grab a bite in downtown the staff are friendly and the menu is simple they are opened until 3am daily the space is handicap accessible and spacious yay cookies
3297,this place deserves a special mention it s not really on the heart of the city for tourists but it s definitely a place you should mark down for one brunch at least shrimp n grits are hands down the best we ve had in the city the juices were fresh and for a person who has a hard time eating omelettes surrey s has converted me for sure the lump crab omelette with the sauce was just the cure for a dull grey rainy morning word of caution the place is always full so make sure you get there at least 30 mins before you really want to eat just to make sure you don t starve over the delish smells that keep on wafting out
3298,always get a sicilian pizza here and they never disappoint the staff here feel like family
3299,this place is a great location with an awesome vibe i appreciated that they knew we were in a hurry so they got us in and out quickly and worked with us on running late heads up the asian shrimp appetizer is spicy it was too spicy for most of us
3300,long lines and slightly disorganized in the distribution component food was good but not the best available at the public market by far as it was rather bland
3301,many improvements found after a follow up visit months after their startup lighting has improved chips are much better service was spot on and outside of a service error at the table next to mine i d call this location a solid three star location
3302,david came as a recommendation from the community we wanted to buy into at first i was skeptical thinking that he just happened to be a friend of whoever answered the phone when he and i spoke he knew a lot about the community he knew his way around he knew the people that worked there he showed us several different layouts found in the community which gave us a better idea of what we would be looking for in a home he was kind and patient when we would stress about never finding the right place he offered his expertise and support whenever we needed him from start to finish he found us our dream home in less than a month we couldn t be happier with him or his service great down to earth guy we would recommend him whole hearty to anyone
3303,just a small town off the highway dd they do a good job and i stop here at least once a month not much to say but they will always be a stop once i get into nj,the service was superb there was this rising star and the young man was on point he was polite observant and very accommodating for his third day and handling a large table with the young lady he should be at cracker barrel for a long time the food was good i couldn t decide between fish or shrimp so i went with my staple catfish and it didn t disappoint we had a large table of about 15 people and a whole lot of food
3304,the quiche was good and the coffee was decent spacious place with good seating have to come back for their crepes a normal neighborhood cafe stop by if you are in the area
3305,first time here got bagelicious sandwich bagel was delicious and filling drink was a small iced coffee and boy is it strong and tasty really pleased with my experience here there s a lovely seating area in the back of the shop don t be fooled that it looks small from the front go in and check out their large menu of items monica was behind the counter and she was so sweet i will be back
3306,we all had a great time we went to watch the football game we ordered wings onion rings and drinks the server was great the food was great food on time drinks on time as well all tv s were working sound system was great we sat outside and had a great time it s not our 1st time here and we love it
3307,visited this rooftop bar for a private party parking is terrible but everyone knows that going anywhere around downtown nola i also had no idea one needed a room key to go to this floor thank goodness the front door guy asked if we needed assistance since we looked confused could have more of a selection of alcoholic beverages but it s still new it s also a bit off the beaten path but the view is really nice comfortable seating areas with trendy furnishings if you have a hot date or a good group to have fun with it s a very cool place i m sure this will be a new hot spot who doesn t like a snazzy little rooftop bar i ll definitely be back to have another great night,um yum we have been wanting to try this place for a while there s always a wait though my man is quite impatient we decided to wait this time so glad we did the food is great and the place is so cute it s a bit congested inside getting a table is a bit of a cluster but once ya get past that and start eating yay we ll definitely be back for more
3308,while the food was pretty good the portions were not the waitress kept saying that the tapas were shareable for 2 4 people but even when she explained the dishes ie you get 3 ribs it certainly didn t sound like much to share and we were right the portions were tiny the largest portions of what we ordered were the fried chicken and mac n cheese being a vegetarian we got the mac n cheese with the crawfish on the side and then the gnocchi while these were good i could ve definitely eaten these all by myself i was sad to share it with everyone else since we ordered things as a table the gnocchi was not a large dish at all and luckily not everyone at the table had some since we had other dishes containing meat for everyone else the sweet potato fries that come with the fried chicken by the way are two very large tempura sweet potatoes so no you will not actually get any fries the atmosphere is really cool and if you love whiskey they have a large variety but i definitely wouldn t go here to eat especially if you want to end up full without spending over 40 for yourself
3309,i had the best experience hosting my sister in law s baby shower at the west ave grille first i got in contact with chelsea kaplan the events coordinator who was so helpful and responsive throughout the planning process she always answered my emails right away and made sure that everything was perfect on the day of we had the front room for 30 people and it was a perfect amount of space we were all close and cozy without being overcrowded it really was such a lovely day i chose to have fresh fruit and danish orange juice carafes for the champagne i brought for mimosas and a choice of three entrees for the guests everyone was very happy with the food which came out really quickly after ordering our main server was jess who was awesome our other server i want to say molly she is the assistant to dan was also awesome they were so nice and personable and really concerned with making sure everything was perfect the planning was easy the staff is wonderful the food is great the restaurant is adorable and in a great location i would recommend to anyone planning an event that they check out west ave grille it is laid back and intimate
3310,amazing amazing amazing we stopped in around 12 45pm on a tuesday for something sweet and my wife and i were very pleased we ordered the cinnamon roll and the strawberry cheesecake donut they called our order very quickly and the deserts were so good great place
3311,i love the location of cafe pontalba next to jackson square i really came here for a cajun bloody mary and it was well worth it the menu looks great as some breakfasts that i noticed while walking to the beautiful bar next time i ll eat instead of drinking my breakfast in the big easy,the perfect place for fish n chips monday s are a deal with a bogo for 14 99 they have a wide selection of other great dishes too shepard s pie corned beef bangers and mash even liver onions if your not into that they offer wraps meatloaf pulled pork happy hour is everyday except mondays now due to the bogo fish n chips they also have live music but i m sure of the schedule last but not lest they offer a great beer selection slainte
3312,great little spot to grab a quick breakfast lunch or smoothie i had two tacos fish and chicken and i loved theredpickled cabbage on them very affordable
3313,excellent ghost pepper beer along with smoked brisket sandwich with pit beans was very loud and we could not talk to people in our group too many tvs and way to loud for dinner
3314,very hipster and unique they don t do reservations so expect a long wait time since the space is small definitely try their home made roll if you re a bread lover the wait was long but the food was quick had the vegetarian omelette could use a bit more flavor but all in all a great place to try when you re in new orleans
3315,food was good no complaints party of 20 of us went they were quick and we always had a drink fun lunch with the family super service
3316,have a wonderful time at the make it fair today they have a great selection of handmade items for sale i bought myself a nice long gold necklace a beautiful cutting board made from maple and some lovely alberta t shirts from ole
3317,the crawfish beignet is one of the best things i have ever had in my life doughy and sweet yet savory with the crawfish and the cream sauce love the spicy kick that the jalapenos bring the place was packed on friday night but they seated our table of 9 with no problem our server q was great highly recommend
3318,my boyfriend s favorite celebration place we go after any kind of accomplishment and even rough days their house margaritas and top shelf are amazing food always comes out hot and the smell is just divine it s a smaller place so be prepared to wait on a weekend but it s totally worth it we mostly sit at the bar anyways
3319,i love every dish and every beverage i m addicted my favorite meet up spot for dates hanging with friends and work meetings
3320,i came here for my birthday brunch and was pleasantly surprised our server was wonderful and she talked a lot with us and made the experience even better every single dish ordered from our table was delicious definitely one of he best brunch places in nashville
3321,a decent coffeehouse with lots of seats tables for working but there s no wifi which makes it kind of a useless cafe if you want to do work both of the green teas sold here were very refreshing though
3322,as always the meal here at tokyo in smyrna was very good there staff is friendly and well trained they answered my questions about selections knowledgeably the food was both eye appealing and delicious and served piping hot in the dining area where i chose to eat vs the hibachi seating great meal
3323,we took pizza home the first time and ate in the restaurant for our second visit the pizza is thin crust and cooked in a gas fired oven similar in style to wood fired pizza ovens the pizza is very good the gf crust was ok and the salads average one very noticeable thing for me was the lack of a recycling bin for the plastic and glass containers we took all our recycling home please provide recycling at your restaurants
3324,this is a great salon the tools they use are clean coming from a new package every time there are liners on the pedicure stations on top of that they do a great job my nails always come out looking great and are shaped nicely how i like them
3325,love the patio bar and fire pit great atmosphere pizza is delicious i m not much of beer drinker but they have a full bar and my drinks are always great
3326,food and atmosphere was very good service was slow worth going to if you have the time
3327,lovely little flower shop with great staff stopped in for a couple arrangements for a wedding shower nothing pre made but said they could put something together quickly within 10 minuted had 2 of these lovely arrangements they did a great job and were affordable highly recommend this cute shop
3328,i came hear after hearing about it from a friend this is a great concept for a dessert bar and the service was excellent my friend and i shared 6 of the mini cupcakes which proved to be a perfect way to try many of the flavors the cookies and cream was my favorite but they were all delicious the mini cupcakes were packed full of flavor i liked them so much that i ordered a few to go to bring to my friends and family i hope to go back to swah rey again sometime soon
3329,i ve mostly stuck to one sushi place in town over the last six or seven years because of this there is a feeling of wonder in striking out to brave a new restaurant and finding an excellent meal unagi sushi has been on my radar for awhile i mean i am in love with unagi and it s literally in the name i ordered a large hot sake some eel sashimi and the special crunchy roll the portions were nice the price was fair and the first bite was oh so satisfying eel is one of those things that has to be cooked perfectly the sauce has to be well balanced in flavor and portioned correctly the meat has to be so soft it melts in your mouth and the consistency must be uniform without a bone to be tasted this hit all three marks right on target i already find myself wishing i had taken pictures of the carrot butterfly and flowers that adorned the plate maybe next time i ll snap a few photos the roll was so good i tried another the eel special and again was sent to unagi heaven i got desert green tea mochi ice cream and it was so soft and tasty the mochi was doughy and the ice cream was smooth all th best consistency and outlined with whipped cream and sprinkles all i can say is if you like eel like i do and want something that is made with care please try this place out
3330,excellent food atmosphere and service good prices great lunch menu burgers chicken and salads are all terrific and those fries yummmm
3331,this is quickly becoming my favorite mexican restaurant downtown indy i ve had several varieties of their tacos chips n guac enchiladas and more margaritas than i d like to admit to the margs are deliciously strong plus they have great selection of mezcal my personal favorite in a margarita the staff is super friendly and owners are great guys highly recommended your first time won t be your last
3332,loved loved the food while visiting tucson i was looking for a local eatery and found the perfect spot i would highly recommend food was eclectic and yummy
3333,thanks to penny we had the easiest rental car experience we didn t think to make a reservation but she took care of us regardless great social skills and even guided us to getting discounted snowboarding passes we really appreciate the service we were set up with a great four wheel drive jeep to keep us prepped for the storm coming really grateful for the outstanding service we will recommend to others and continue to use this company
3334,whoa this place is good took my family there last night and was totally impressed i had the heirloom tomato salad with salmon wow huge heirloom tomatoes with fresh burrata cheese piled high on peppery arugula with a fantastic olive oil simple dressing and then a side of perfectly grilled salmon just excellent burgers were off the charts good as were sweet potato fries check this place out and you won t be disappointed remember to bring wine
3335,if yo ve never been here before go if you ve been here before go hands down the mouth and stomach of the south incredible food
3336,we stopped here the friday of memorial day weekend this rest stop is quite scenic with the water on one side and views of the bridge the bathrooms were clean but the sinks and toilets were very low almost like what you might find in an elementary school they have a handful of drink and snack machines i even spotted a payphone not a bad place to stop for a quick bathroom break this is no frills you won t find a gas station or fast food here
3337,this is the place to buy jewelry without having to wonder if you are buying quality at the right price anthony s is an old family business where they treat you like the personal reasons you have for buying something are important to them i bought my wife s engagement ring there i haven t bought much since but they know me by name when i call or walk in the door there are a lot of places which put themselves forward as jewelers in shopping centers etc establish a relationship with anthony s instead i am related to a well known family of jewelers who have a store on jeweler s row on sansom st i go to anthony s
3338,wowee so fresh and clean is this new clean eating establishment i had the acai styled bowl made with coconut water the service was friendly and prompt the food was tasty and healthy what a great treat after spending all your pay on the tasty goodies next door at the asain food market
3339,wonderful service kind people and a clean and fresh place to go for spa services i went for an eyebrow tint being my first time for this service i was very nervous but the girl did a great job and was very patient i had little to no redness after my waxing they obviously use quality product
3340,we ve stayed here a few times over the years by virtue of having family in close proximity the staff is invariably courteous but i have to confess that the place has seen better times the carpets are beginning to get a bit ragged as is the furniture on our most recent sojourn the water would not drain from the bathtub the lady in the reception was kind enough to find us another room but the room smelled strongly of frying oil given that it was way past our bedtime we chose to keep the room think the innkeepers need to up their game a bit here
3341,great food great burgers great service need i say more just had an absolutly amazing burger on gf bun best in tampa 5 18 update repeating theme of over cooked burgers order requests not followed by kitchen and inconsistent food during different visits was getting used to it but leaving today another table was talking to waitress that everything was over cooked an i thought yep a trend in the wrong direction need to lower my rating and hope management is reading get your kitchen in order as i heard my self say i will rethink my next visit
3342,everytime i come here i m always greeted by someone who is eager to help i don t know how they pack all of the merchandise in such a small place it s faster and easier to get what you want here than at home depot or any of the big chains these guys are super knowledgeable another reason to support your local store,i love this place i always passed by it but i really did not know anything about afghan cuisine went in one day and i m glad i did food was great the service was great too we ve been back many times and will continue to do so
3343,amazing view and it doesn t spin to where you feel like throwing up while dining the only thing i would say is that they need to update their decor and have vegan options
3344,delicious food in a very attractive environment our server was friendly attentive and helpful each course was well presented and very flavorful it took a long time to get a reservation here but it was worth the wait
3345,i have to say when you re hungry for pizza and you re the only place in the immediate area that s gotta get you brownie points that aside i can say i ve now been there more than once and the quality of the food is consistently excellent pizza is great and i ve repeated on the goat cheese caramelized walnuts apple salad concoction they have deduct one star for the wait i called in my last order they quoted me one hour i showed up an hour later and still waited about 15 minutes i don t mind waiting but let me know that said i ll be back i love it my wife loved it and the kids inhaled their pizza
3346,complete food junkie and this is probably the best breakfast we have had while traveling my wife had the famous lemon corncakes which are an absolute must the mocha was a great addition as well i had the omelet of the day which was chorizo pork sausage pablano peppers onion cheddar and cilantro it was perfect i added in a bit of their sriracha hot chili sauce which was on the table lastly i asked for jelly with my side of toast and they brought me i believe their home made apple cinnamon jelly which was probably the best i ve had in a long time i highly recommend this place
3347,my goodness this place is awesome love this restaurant great tacos sonoran dogs tortas salsa so much delicious food everything is seasoned very well awesome horchata as well
3348,cool atmosphere and good food the only thing that didn t make them 5 star was the fact that the queso tasted like processed cheese
3349,super laid back and very chill we grabbed some fresh shucked oysters and beers and just chatted while enjoying the view of the ocean can t get any better than that
3350,we stopped by here yesterday on national ramen day april 4 and really enjoyed the meal started with two appetizers karage chicken and chili sesame dumplings the dumplings were the more successful of these the rich sesame and hot chili were nice counterpoints to the pork dumplings chicken could ve had more seasoning and i think it usually works better with dark meat but it was nice and crunchy we both had tonkatsu ramen which was lovely the broth was delicious and flavorful really enjoyed it
3351,i will always recommend puckett s food is great beer selection is great and the atmosphere is great the wait staff is always friendly and kind the food is always hot
3352,when i got back from teaching in china back in 07 there was one thing i wanted more than anything else soup dumplings and it was the one thing i couldn t find on sale in any of the local chinese places these are the soup dumplings i was looking for
3353,first breakfast here many pizzas here tried a country breakfast with sausage and eggs over medium hash browns and a biscuit hubby had ham 2 eggs medium while wheat toast and home fries well we both enjoyed a hearty well prepared very tasty breakfast the eggs were perfect and so was everything i m on my second cup of tea that i didn t have to ask for we re coming back,we enjoyed our first breakfast here saturday morning the service was good and the food was good too we both had eggs over medium with home fries service was quick and they were not jammed we are from new jersey so diners are in our blood we just enjoy the diner bibe this certainly qualifies they serve breakfast lunch and dinner but they close at 3pm on saturdays and sundays
3354,so kudos for sabrina s and yelp looking for a nice lunch in reno i went to yelp and punched in some key words to avoid the usual fast food chain joints and up popped sabrina s ok good reviews interesting pics and menu items off we go the location is downtown but not smack dab in the casino zone nice decor trendy the menu offers some nice salads and soups we both had the bean soup i highly recommend and salads asian noodle and south west both salads were well presented ample in portion fresh and flavorful we took the recommendation of our server and had the house made ginger ale all in all a very pleasant delicious lunch prepared by nice people in a trendy setting
3355,just got my first cut from mr carson gauthreaux today and it came with a free shot of whiskey good conversation without the awkward often forced feeling small talk i ve often experienced carson paid a lot of attention to detail overall a great experience i will definitely be back
3356,i have to say is a normal hotel not nice and not ugly but the breakfast is super great cost me about 80 so i say is decent price i would have like that they extended the breakfast time to 10am i only had 20min i got there at 8 35 for breakfast and when it hit 8 50 the lady started to put everything away
3357,worth the 10 and worth the wait best food truck in philly bar none
3358,we visited the restaurant because of a friend s recommendation and it didn t let us down food was great and service as well our server was manuel little gem in town will be back soon
3359,great happy hour specials 2 well drinks 3 craft pints 1 2 price apps can t be beat
3360,went monday for lunch with the family we went to the village whiskey when it was in ac and enjoyed it the philly location is very small just a few tables but just as good great burgers and awesome fries worth the extra money though the lunch special was fairly reasonable village whiskey does not disappoint
3361,we made reservations for a saturday night we were promptly seated and the wait staff was courteous and efficient the veal chop was sublime and the rib eye perfectly done the risotto was very tasty but the favorite was the salted caramel chocolate cake with pecans go for the dessert alone
3362,we love this place when we visit st pete beautiful large fish tanks and a gift shop that offers nice souvenirs guy harvey rumfish apparel two indoor areas one is a full bar with a full counter and stools where you can order an appetizer drink while you are waiting on your table second there is a beautiful indoor restaurant surrounded by floor to ceiling fish tanks the food is always delicious i ordered the grouper my husband ordered the swordfish our kids had the shrimp and grits and we were all pleased courteous staff and we did not wait long to be served
3363,adorable cafe in ybor city we had an affogato and a cortadito both were delicious fantastic customer service and great vibe in a beautiful city there were games and plenty of seating great place to catch up with friends or catch up on work definitely recommend

3365,if you re in nola and want great food outside of the french quarter stop by morrow s i highly recommend the bibimbap the prices are great extremely friendly staff the drinks are the location is small but the food packs big flavor the owner proprietor larry morrow is nawlins native and he s all about serving his community i suggest getting there early as they re known to have a line just know it ll be well worth the wait
3366,this place is within walking distance a few years ago an old coworker would bring these donuts into the office every friday like clockwork i left that company and hadn t had them in years i finally ordered a dozen yesterday to take to a fantasy football draft party they were a hit very tasty reasonably priced and friendly service
3367,great find small place at the end of the french market but such a hidden treasure grabbed a quick bite to eat and a frozen strawberry margarita good music playing and trendy decor
3368,we went for their happy hour and of course we had to get the oysters they are in season so they were so fresh and delicious paired great with champagne would highly recommend this place
3369,i am so impressed with how hotel provincial handled my situation kerri was helping me coordinate rooms brunch for my daughter s wedding we were blocking off an entire courtyard section for my group plus getting ready to plan a brunch for the morning after in the hotel s newly renovated event area well the reception that was to take place next door at the old ursuline convent fell through due to the fact that our group was not going to fit in their space kerri was able to cancel all our plans refund me the little deposit i put down on some of the rooms and she did it all so graciously thank you kerri i would have loved to stay at hotel provincial it s location is so convenient to the french quarter and after being there on site i can say that area feels really safe
3370,it has been over 7 years since i reviewed parrot pete s i just happened to have a breakfast meeting here today so it s time for an update first i have to say that i do like the decor i guess my taste has changed because my last review mentioned how much i hated it there are plenty of windows and there s a nice tropical feel about the place as for the food they have everything i can t remember if they had a full menu the last time i reviewed but they have everything from breakfast to dinner and i think that they serve breakfast all day i got an iced caf au lait and an order of the shrimp and grits the caf au lait was okay but seemed to be more milk than coffee the shrimp and grits were really good it was a huge bowl of shrimp served with creamy cheese grits and sausage i really enjoyed it and for 13 the serving was a nice size the dish had a lot of flavor and i didn t have to add anything to it to make it pop our waitress was super nice and attentive and checked on us regularly in addition to a full food menu parrot pete s has cupcakes and whole cakes so i might head back over when i m in the mood for some dessert
3371,great food knew we were in a good place when the restaurant was full on a sunday night place lives up to the reviews sat at bar and still got great service from everyone not just our server hats off to the general manager on site we forgot a wallet tried to use our samson pay by phone had glitch i waited as collateral ha as they patiently waited for my hubby to drive back to he hotel to get a credit card classy that alone should tell you this place is worth the drive kudos to all thank you barb
3372,i came in spur of the moment with some girlfriends and had my best experience here yet the food was great as always and our server mohammed was very attentive and kept us laughing all night i ll definitely be requesting him next time
3373,one of the best intros to new orleans this was our first stop from the airport on a saturday morning we were brought here by a friend who loves this place we now know why and we absolutely agree we got here when it opened at 11 am and it soon filled up we ordered and ate family style so that we could all enjoy everything we started off with a dozen raw oysters that were fresh tasty and yummy made our own sauce of horse radish lemon hot sauce ketchup which we place onto the oysters and those babies went down soooo smoothly my wife who never had a raw oyster before and was hesitant to try became an instant convert next we had gator bites 2 different ways blackened and fried both were really good but the blackened ones were our favorites did a fil seafood gumbo that was wonderful nice and flavorful then we dug into 2 lbs of boiled crawfish flavorful nice bite and so good finally finished it all by washing it down with another dozen raw oysters tried a couple of beers to pair with it all and found the blue moon was the better than the abita amber this became our benchmark for oysters gumbo boiled crawfish and gator bites for the rest of our culinary adventures in new orleans and the oysters gator bites here were the best the gumbo also stood out as among the best we had price wise it was verrrrry reasonable and not expensive at all many local families were here while we were dining here as well all in all a win win win
3374,well this place is nice place for breakfast but they are not able to provide the service probably because of volume hosts are unaware of waiting lists stuff seems like overwhelmed i think they need to improve their customer service
3375,the operations manager was able to explain and assure the options missing from the new car would be corrected
3376,we loved our first visit to morrow s which is new addition to the culinary offerings in our new orleans neighborhood the food was excellent we had red beans and rice and fried chicken the red beans were just delicious is say the best we ve had and we ve had them all over the city the fried chicken was very tender subtly spiced and beautifully crisped i admit i was a bit leery reading the poor reviews about the long waits for food and service but as a new restaurant they had some kinks to work out at this point though the service is excellent kasii our waitperson was very attentive friendly and helpful
3377,nice little beer stop has a solid selection of craft beer their cheesesteaks are amazing and packed with meat the french fries are also very good if you are in the neighborhood and want s great cheesesteak and fries this is your place
3378,the best coffee and the best eggs toast and avocado try the munster sandwich it s really yummy and the biscuit and honey is a must yummy all the way
3379,01 09 18 i just came back from applebees i was a little apprehensive after reading the reviews because i hadn t been there for a while well i had nothing to worry about my husband took me there for my birthday no one else there knew it was my birthday we had a server named mo he was a great server he had a least 5 tables that we saw maybe more that he was waiting on but treated all his customers the same asking always is everything ok do you need any thing else the food came out fast and was excellent could not complain about anything it was a great night good server great food i will be back again
3380,friendly and welcoming staff food was very good and flavorful tom yum soup was easily one of the best i had
3381,friendly bartender the beer was middle of the road quality folks seemed to enjoy the molecular munchies food truck the ambiance fits the tech park environment
3382,i went here for the first time today and i split nachos with a friend i am vegetarian but my friend was not and the staff was incredibly accommodating they put my friend s beef for his nachos on the side the nachos are large and come with a decent amount of toppings your choice of meat beans cheese sour cream pico lettuce and queso the only issue i have is that there was no guacamole on the nachos the prices are not bad as they give you a large portion i can t wait to come again
3383,i ve gone here for several massages since moving to philly great place to get pampered colleen is an exceptional massage therapist great for deep tissue work and getting in there to work on problem areas and address issues beth is also great and will utilize multiple techniques to relieve pain and get you relaxed can use the rest of the facilities if you get a spa treatment including sauna and steam shower highly recommended
3384,i have heard several people talk about luke now that i finally made it here i can t believe i have deprived myself of this place for so long very very excellent food shrimp and grits w crab meat was a one of a kind dish crawfish bisque was no slouch at all either already planning an encore visit
3385,cafe beignet and musical legends park offers a great reprieve from the hustle and bustle of bourbon street if you re still looking to drink while listening to some live jazz the bar has got you covered with cocktails and alcoholic slushes my boyfriend and i popped by on a monday night around 8pm for some beignets to compare to the ones we had over at cafe du monde beignets here are 3 99 for three we ordered pretty quickly and were able to snag one of the few empty tables while the service was incredibly slow we found ourselves mostly distracted by music and just basking in the ambience the beignets were fantastic came freshly fried and hot with healthy dustings of powered sugar i would have liked more sugar but it was perfect for my boyfriend we also got a southern comfort mango slush to share which was pretty good and felt solidly packed with alcohol
3386,i decided to give this place another shot because i know they have good quality food as long as you go in expecting a line get your name on their waiting list a hostess will come around to get your name and maybe 15 minutes wait depending on how far back in line you are i would not recommend any groups larger than 4 as seating is very limited so with that mindset you re ready for two chicks cafe i absolutely love love their bbq shrimp and grits it s the second best shrimp and grits i ve ever had the best is a restaurant in louisville i come to nola a lot for work at the convention center and would try to eat here every time i come for a visit i also really enjoy their green blast juice if i can splurge on a drink like that i ve had their buckwheat savory crepe before and it wasn t bad i ve heard from multiple people that their quinoa salad is very good i think i ll give that a try soon i thought this place is very tasty and deserves an updated review
3387,popped over to besito for happy hour after picking up a friend from the airport super friendly and helpful staff the food was amazing too between the four of us we split multiple items on the happy hour menu from flautas de pollo to guac made tableside everything tasted amazing and was a perfect meal in the sun in tampa from seattle not so much sun right now in spring
3388,one of my favorite small restaurants in indianapolis so many selections for everyone in your party to be happy with the staff was helpful and the atmosphere of the place was calm quiet they have a neat window booth for those celebrating with a party
3389,excellent place for children we took our 4 year old and she loved it the train station is conveniently located next to the museum
3390,i ordered a caesar salad with shrimps and the shrimps tasted terrible just like some cheap frozen ones you might find in bad college dining halls
3391,long time new orleans visitor first time to creole house after our experience i m sad that i didn t discover this place sooner our service was top notch i wish i could remember our servers name he definitely deserves a mention the spicy nola bites are delicious perfect appetizer the bite isn t spicy the dipping sauce tastes like it s made from horseradish that s where the kick comes from also the crab cake on the crab cake and shrimp alfredo was the best i ve ever had too many times the crab cakes i ve ordered taste really fishy not these seasoned perfect and a clean crab flavor awesome experience hope our next visit is the same
3392,had an amazingly delightful lunch at a very reasonable price super friendly service ample well presented portions with exceptional flavor great fresh fish selections specialty cocktails extensive beer and wine list all this as well as the perfect location

3394,if you are looking for a healthy breakfast and lunch choice a m factory is on point

3424,we decided to use our newly given privilege to partake in carry out alcohol sales in indiana by going to big red liquors everyone there was extremely friendly the wine and spirits were labeled in a way that made everything easy to locate what you were looking for the one cashier told us how they do wine tastings on fridays they have a cool vault in the bottom which i m hoping is where the wine tastings take place

3436,interesting and tasty menu of beers we re not usually much on the malty and dark offerings but after tasting all of the stoneyhead brews we were impressed with their varied selection all of which were very drinkable and well balanced i m especially wary of seasonals with added flavors but both the summer coriander orange peel and autumn coriander clove were excellent and delicious brad is a great spokesmodel for the brewery and an entertaining and gracious fellow who kept the popcorn full and was knowledgeable about the product without being pushy fun place even if it s a challenge to find the first time highly recommended if you like beer and who doesn t
3437,this place never sees to amaze me the seven course dinner menu is absolutely amazing
3438,for my son s 9th birthday party we took him here we reserved the genius level birthday package don t let the website fool you it says 250 for 8 kids and 275 for 10 along with a 50 dollar deposit they say goes towards tour bottom dollar however even with the deposit taken out expect to pay 300 dollars the fees don t even really make sense my son loved it though an hour of bowling half an hour to eat pizza two games of laser tag and the remainder of the time is spent in the arcade don t expect to get to play some of the better games though and you won t know which one that is until you swipe your surge card they take care of the decorating the planning hosting and clean up so that s nice they provide enough cupcakes for the kids a t shirt and drawstring bags you get two pitchers of unlimited soda and two 1 topping pizzas all in all it s expensive but your kids will love it while there are cheaper party options to choose from this one is the best

3442,awesome food and the portions are a good size highly recommend great location and service
3443,nothing like some good ole st louis bbq stopped in just before closing and they absolutely took care of us our waitress was on point with making sure we were well taken care of in the face of closing i had the greens sweet potato casserole brisket and the smoked turkey the smoked meats were excellent not over bearing with smokey taste but just enough to enjoy all of the flavors of the meat the sweet potato casserole was tasty as well topped with candies pecans yummy this stop gets two thumbs up from me great service price and food well worth the stop if you are in the st charles mo area
3444,i love tazikis it may not be authentic greek food but it s a healthier option when you re eating out i love the gyros and the greek salad they also have a kids menu which my kids aren t big fans of but they are very very picky every time i eat here i think i could live on mediterranean diet
3445,the food is delicious and the service is fast the biscuits are so soft and buttery i had the seafood omelette and grits husband had steak and hash browns so so delicious go check them out if you are in new orleans
3446,this room was incredibly comfortable we got in late and were greeted with warm cookies and the sweetest lady at the front desk when we got to our room they were clean and the beds were so comfortable the next morning we went to the pool which was extremely clean the hotel was also right next to a casino and some awesome outlet stores i definitely recommend staying here
3447,my only complaint here is always the temperature of the building it always seems stuffy and warm no matter what time of year we go other than that we thoroughly enjoyed the new reel west exhibit contemporary art and especially all of the native american paintings i love the old art o matic machine on the second floor next to the elevator it s an old cigarette machine that for 5 you can pull a knob and it will dispense the art of your choice i chose the silver or gold plated earrings knob and got a cute pair of dangly sterling silver earrings designed by an artist other options were necklaces watercolor painting some kind of fortune cookie and many more all in all it was a great way to spend the day with my family the lower level is an interactive play and learning area fun for kids and adults also if you park in the underground garage you can get validation for parking at the ticket counter so that parking is free so don t let parking prices posted deter you from visiting
3448,went to hendel s this year for valentine s day the food was delicious and the service was great especially considering how busy they were for the holiday even though it was only a limited menu there was plenty to choose from and i will definitely be coming back to try the full menu,we did the bud light tour today with brianna as our tour guide she was absolutely amazing incredibly personable and gave lots of cool information we got 2 samples a bottle of bud light and a full pour at the end of the tour overall it was a lot of fun and we will be coming back for a brewmaster tour sometime this year
3449,the drinks are good the crowd is over 40s the cover charge is way more than it should be for the less than stellar live music this particular night consisted of a lady who sounded like she d been sick for weeks the sound was far too loud someone needed to turn the mic down
3450,wow wow wow i wasn t sure what to expect but i ve been looking for a really great sandwich place in nashville and finally tried 51st i had the cuban sandwich and i think it may be the best sandwich i ve had in town when i pulled it out of the bag i was amazed at how heavy it was it was packed with meats in the perfect proportions and condiments were just right the bread was fresh and soft kudos 51st i ll be back and i ll be bringing people with me
3451,still a service now with more emotional service understanding customers their taste top notch environment and as always great menu paneer 65 veg coins and chinese bhel for win
3452,had a great brunch here seitan on the biscuits and gravy is awesome probably would ve been too plain without it
3453,prompt service the gm was even in the house everyone was attentive and the food was worth the airport pricing has pizza half no cheese and creamy chicken noodle
3454,everything about our pad thai and pad ginger was perfect except for the part where they entirely failed to season it a couple of out of towners both agreed it was the blandest thai food we ve ever had the misfortune of encountering and while we re used to ordering it white people mild when we go to thai restaurants here we didn t even specify that being said the tofu was perfectly fried the vegetables were cooked just right the portions were reasonable and the presentation was nice but when you order try asking for it with a little bit of flavor because the default seems to be none
3455,have been wanting to try this place for awhile and i wasnt disappointed ive been vegan for 20 years and can not say how stoked i am to see an all vegan restaurant in my city easy parking and super clean and inviting atmosphere staff is rad and attentive and a for labelled gender neutral bathrooms it took me forever to decide what to get because everything on the menu looked amazing i ended up with a setian tenderloin sandwich and mac and cheese it was amazeeeeeeeballs i am a huge fan of what i think is a nooch based cheese they used in the mac i wish i had a bigger bowl lol the seitain was bomb seasoned perfectly and the fry and it gave the best crisp bite ive had in awhile one of the cooks later gave me a tip to ask for it dipped in buffalo sauce and now i can t wait to come back and try it definitely made a regular out of me with great atmosphere and amazing food bravo
3456,this was pretty good i was looking for some mexican food and found it large portions and it came out relatively quick
3457,awesome service and food was great my toddler and husband had a ball i know others that don t like it but we love it a bit pricey but it s located in the cbd so what you expect great experience
3458,i was in new orleans for five days and i ended up eating here three times good service and the dishes were fantastic the serving size was also tremendous i highly recommend them
3459,pretty average mexican restaurant the chips and salsa they give you when you sit down are not the best the salsa tastes straight out of a can i will say their portion sizes are generous though as the salad was huge the guacamole was not good and did not taste fresh either the best part would have been the sangria or the queso blanco which you can really mess up
3460,average woodfired pizza the inside is congested and made me feel like i was in a cafeteria average service there are better wood fired pizza options in the area
3461,sorry they ve closed the restaurant as of 2 18 18 i always loved their dumplings peking duck and other specialties
3462,ithai sushi is an excellent local thai restaurant in an unassuming location you don t really know what to expect judging by the outside inside it s a cute little spot a traditional thai decor with tables in the center and booths around the sides in two rooms on a recent monday night there were only 2 other couples dining but the take out business was booming that s always an encouraging sign it s an extensive menu with all of the traditional thai dishes plus a wide variety of sushi amy tried the pad thai with chicken this was excellent among the best we ve had the noodles were cooked slightly al dente the peanut sauce sweet and creamy the garnishes of scallion and bean sprouts crisp and fresh a generous portion of sliced broiled chicken topped the dish this was ordered medium hot and the spice is what you would expect resulting in a runny nose and rosy cheeks but tasty in every bite i had the green curry with shrimp the curry was smooth and creamy with just a little heat brimming with red and yellow bell pepper slices and at least 10 nice sized shrimp the shrimp were well prepared a nice snap to each bite firm and not mealy a generous scoop of perfect sticky rice molded into the shape of a star a nice touch is served on the side the curry over that rice is to die for the tab for two was 30 including 2 soft drinks so inexpensive if you re looking for excellent thai food in a comfortable environment right here in town try ithai recommended
3463,i m pretty disappointed with enterprise today to say the least i ve been getting rental cars from them for quite some time but it seems as if the service has just gone way down hill bret was really sweet when i had entered but you could tell he was really flustered as it seems as if he was training two other new guys i ve been there and done that so i wasn t too worried about getting too much out of the new guys it s been awhile since i ve had to rent a car through enterprise so i kind of forgot how the process works i left with absolutely no paperwork and no clear idea of what to expect to be honest i don t know if i m supposed to pay for the gas what i even paid as i didn t get a copy of my receipt normally in the past they give me a paper copy of everything including the damage chart i didn t even get asked if i wanted insurance or anything either seemed as if they just assumed since i had my own i didn t need coverage adrian was the one who showed me around to the cars and i could absolutely tell he was new and very anxious and nervous i told them i did not want a mustang as the first time i got one from them it was a bad experience the first car he showed me was super dirty and reeked of cigarettes i m going on a long trip this weekend and i know for a fact i would not be able to stand the smell the second car he showed me was a small compact car which was fine until he turned the engine on and service lights popped up this started to get frustrating as i had to return to work and still had no car i m not sure why the cars aren t inspected prior to walking a client out to view them i told him that if i had to take the mustang i will because i needed to get back to work turns out his coworker had already took the mustang for someone else so it wasn t even available to begin with here i am not stuck with this truck that is much much larger than my own car gas is going to be terrible and i m just so frustrated i don t even want to come back he told me he would call me to see if there was another car to swap it out with but i m not counting on it too much at this point i m leaving out of town tomorrow and need a new vehicle asap i should ve went with hertz originally because this whole experience is so frustrating considering that i called the beginning of the week to make sure everything would be smooth and effortless my past experiences have been fine but today was definitely not it s probably hit or miss you can come in expecting good service or get unlucky and not edit i changed my review to three stars as they are swapping my car out for a new one i still think the inspection process could be so much better
3464,i had the tailpipe tacos and they were amazing you can t beat the endless glass of margaritas which are not watered down at all
3465,the bbq beans were very delicious the tri pi with the chimichurri was seasoned well,not the best way to make a meatloaf i did not enjoy the use of sausage it didn t even taste like a meatloaf i will not get this again but the mashed potatoes were very delicious spot on and the tots were good i would come back and get that again
3466,open 24 7 plenty of equipment never too crowded classes also available the staff is always friendly and willing to help the district manager stops in as well every week to make sure everything is on the up and up and my membership is good everything
3467,i m sitting at the bar right now and i have to say that the bartender sarah is absolutely phenomenal if i didn t know better i d think she had 8 arms and eyes in the back of her head she should go from location to location and train your other spots
3468,i ve only had the cannolis here but they are awesome they re freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal not too sweet it s perfect if you like cannoli if you don t think you like cannoli you should definitely get one from termini bros
3469,this is probably one of the friendliest businesses i ve ever been to all the mechanics and personnel are very friendly and helpful willing to allow the way to make sure you have a pleasant visit the attendance out front take very well care of you with washing your windshields and letting you know if your inspections are due and very honest group of people at this place
3470,heather was my waitress and a bartender everything i tried was fabulous i had tenderloin sliders with the french fries oh my god i will be going back here as often as i possibly can you will not regret trying this place
3471,their tint is exceptional the quality of material and labor that goes into each job is unparalleled garett takes pride in his work and it s clear through the end results he and his staff is pleasant to talk to very knowledgeable and professional the clientele range from subaru s to high end vehicles like ferrari s and tesla s affordable and quality i m happy to give him our business and i will always highly recommend him to others
3472,small restaurant in the casino 4 stars because there isn t much service you order at the counter and they deliver the food to you busing of the tables were slow as well however the food we ordered was great i had the fried oyster platter and it was really good we also ordered the charbroiled oysters and they were amazing
3473,any time we re out of town we always look for a brewpub as we usually end up with great beer and food this time was a disappointment the service was poor we probably waited 5 10 minutes before we saw the waitress another 5 10 minutes before we got a beer for my daughter and a taster for me another 5 10 minutes before we got our water and another 5 10 minutes before we got the beer based on the taster and the biggest disappointment was that the beer was just blah my daughter s ipa was just okay and she s an ipa lover my taster was blah and the hefeweizen style beer i got instead of the taster tasted a bit like bud lite the food was okay but the portions were small for the price my daughter got the steak salad which was bigger than a side salad but surprisingly skimpy even in terms of the lettuce her saiad had about 1 4 of a portobello mushroom two grains of the ancient rice blend almost no gorgonzola and only about 3 4 ounces of steak my meatloaf was fair the bbq sauce was really good but the meatloaf was really dense and not super flavorful the mashed potatoes on top were great but the portion was very small it came with quite a few onion curls and the piece of bread had been placed underneath the meat and potatoes which was kind of odd for 17 95 for the meatloaf i was disappointed
3474,went to the red pony for my birthday with my family amazing atmosphere and food our server brian with very knowledgeable with food choices and specialty drinks great value for the money a must dining experience if you re in franklin
3475,been going to honeygrow for a while now and boy have they changed their portion sizes shrank and their menu continuously change and the toppings to base ratio has changed but one thing they have been consistent about is fresh and tasty food along with the smaller portion size they changed the take out container to a eco friendly paper bowl it works great for the salads but for the stir fry s it seems to soak up all the sauce which i do not like the honey bar is delicious and the selections are great honey grow is usually relatively fast and most of the time accurate during the lunch rush it can get crazy because it s busy it s great healthy food that is priced a tad pricey for the portion size but it is worth it for the freshness currently the salads will be the only thing i go back for
3476,food was average and did take a bit to come out service was good great local beer selection had chimichanga and burger and fries both were average but not outstanding great space bar
3477,one of the best pizzas i ve ever had great service on top beware the ranch has dill i ve never had ranch with dill and i m not a fan overall a great place to eat
3478,i ve only had the wings here but they re pretty good i just get the house sauce with garlic cheese fries on the side great late night spot but i often call before making the trip just to ensure they re open
3479,everything i ve tried here has been awesome and the people who run it are great the brisket is the best i ve ever had and so are the brussels sprouts
3480,loved this place this place was recommended by our uber driver while my fianc and i were visiting nashville we stopped in for a few drinks at the bar and we loved the atmosphere our bartender was fantastic and a true artist with crafting amazing cocktails we met some very friendly people while sitting at the bar throughout the night and we both enjoyed the delicious craft cocktails that milk honey had to offer we ordered the burrata and fig very delicious i don t think you could go wrong with any of their cocktails either thanks for making our trip and evening a memorable one milk honey we can t wait to come back
3481,my family has been eating there ice cream forever in high school i use to go get ice cream for lunch when anybody comes to town we take them there
3482,such a great bar clean and bright friendly bartenders tasty drinks and food great happy hour specials
3483,living walking distance from this pizza place is the best thing ever on nights that we have a blizzard tonight i can just walk over and pickup my pizza typically i call ahead and then walk over at the time they say it will be done it is usually not done at their estimate time but i always go in with the expectation it won t be the pizza is delicious basic pizza if you sign up for their app you get notification every friday for their pie of the week which is 50 off this is always a specialty pizza so it is a great deal keep your eyes peeled too because they always pass out cards around town for free stix great incentive for me to order from here
3484,high quality ingredients fast and friendly service makes this an instant favorite of ours family friendly pet area with picnic tables out back cool vibe sports on tv good beer on tap and kombucha on tap all this and the best part was still the quality tacos sides and fresh hot chips out of the kitchen i haven t had great food like this creative and interesting since moving from chicago
3485,this place is amazing oysters are 75 cents during happy hour and they are so fresh we had an amazing server everyone checked up on how we were doing and if the food was good my group of 3 had ordered the corn and crab bisque the luke burger 12 oysters and a dish with ham and bread and so much more the chefs are so kind and checked on us through the window they gave us each a fry and cut up our burger since we splitting it without extra cost or us having to tell them i love it here and will most definitely be coming back they gave us a table straight away without a reservation
3486,great little find in boise if you re up for something much more interesting than pizza great food quality service and fair prices
3487,in town for business and found this little restaurant on yelp it did not disappoint the owner is delightful and helped us with our selections everything from the egg rolls jerky cucumber salad to our three different main entrees was made to order tasty and had the appropriate heat if we get back to the area phan s kitchen will definitely be on the schedule
3488,from service to food everything was just damn good the bakery is delish their selections of beers and cocktails is good and accompanies their menu nicely we will be back on our next trip to nashville and recommend this place if you are in the gulch area
3489,thank you to bobby the manager as is of course sometimes the case in fast food there was a mistake with our order through the drive through since we still had our receipt we were able to return inside the restaurant and show the incorrect item we received and bobby not only made sure we got the correct item but also apologized for the inconvenience and threw in something extra for our trouble this is the type of customer service i grew up with but sadly is so very rarely the case nowadays thank you again to bobby for excellent customer service
3490,whitney and josh are absolutely amazing to work with not only are they the nicest people but their food is delicious we used blend as our wedding reception caterer and everyone raved about the food they have a diverse menu and are fair on pricing their staff was great to work with and went above and beyond on the day of would definitely recommend to anyone and will definitely use them again for all future events thank you whitney and josh for everything
3491,yummy and fresh tasting we had a great time great service by hannah and meghan nice surprise that they have wine sake and beer available
3492,i took my sister here at 8pm on a sunday night when all other urgent cares were closed as she had terrible flu symptoms i forgot my wallet at my dorm and they allowed us to leave and come back when we realized we could pay with a card number obtained over the phone my sister was seen within 10 minutes the nurse was thorough extremely nice and very sweet as was the doctor who came in after i ve never experienced such positive thorough care from an urgent care facility nor trusted the providers there more they were thoughtful enough to write us a script rather than send it to a pharmacy as some have had tamaflu shortages thankful that a rough night was made much better by their amazing service
3493,great visit veal chop amazing cannoli crunch cake yummy definitely plan another visit
3494,the doughnuts are good but the apple fritter may be the best i have ever had stopped in on a sunday afternoon and full selection was still available and fresh
3495,once again a hole in the wall does not fail if you are big on frills and ambiance without flavor don t eat here if you want flavor without the frills frugally come here buffet was 15 99 and included sweetened or non sweetened ice tea that tea will have me slapping my mama the gumbo was very flavorful and the fried chicken was absolutely delicious shrimp creole macaroni and everything else was very tasty also im not a bread pudding fan but it was also good my maternal grandparents are from nawlins and my mothers cooking is heavily influenced by that the chicken reminded me alot of her fried chicken that people rave about you won t be disappointed unless you need frills
3496,loved these crepes reminded me of the ones i get in france we tried the aussie porky pig ma province and creperie deluxe and they were all great
3497,absolutely wonderful find be careful your eyes will always be bigger than your stomach with this menu service was great and they accommodated a party of 9 as a walk in
3498,came to stl for a wedding and was lucky enough to have my air b and b above this amazing bbq joint they have a smoker outside that is cooking all day making the surrounding area smell heavenly i order the fried korean ribs which had a nice smokey flavor we also tried the fried cat fish we ordered spicy and they re not messing around cooked perfectly with a corn meal breading the fried green tomatoes were nice and had a tangy sauce on the side do yourself a favor and get some moonshine as well
3499,great food and atmosphere if you re just visiting or reside in new orleans this is the place to eat fantastic service and the food is amazing highly reccomemd
3500,cake life is one of my favorite bakeries and i ve only been there once i ordered the chocolate chip walnut cookie while my sister ordered the campfire cocoa cake we received the fiesta cake by accident and the server was kind enough to allow us to keep both slices of cake the cookie was crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside could ve used a little bit more sea salt but the chocolate chips were so fudgey and rich so i didn t have much to complain about the campfire cake was delicious the cake is moist and fluffy while the whipped cream is chocolatey reminded me of the days i d come back home from school on a winter day and i d rip one of those swiss miss packets open into warm milk the buttercream is made with swiss miss by the way the fiesta cake is a bit more dense with a cream cheese frosting definitely an enjoyable experience the shop itself is very cute and beautiful i ll be returning very soon
3501,i wanted to share my dismay with cajun encounters i live uptown nola and rent out my spare bedroom on airb b i had 2 guests from argentina who wanted to see plantations they picked up one of your brochures i called to make reservations for them and the person that answered the phone did not have a clue of basic french quarter cbg map because i told her they would be taking the st charles streetcar and she told me to have them go to 931 decatur i told her that was pretty far away from the end of the line and she said well how about hotel b on canal i asked her what the address was and she said i don t know i went on the website myself and saw there was a pickup at 119 decatur and told her that was much closer they wanted to see oak alley and whitney laura and whitney are on the brochure as a choice but were told when they got on the but they could not go to whitney and had to go to laura instead at nearly 100 a pop service was unsatisfactory
3502,i ordered the club sandwich which includes cold turkey bacon and cheese on french bread the sandwich was delicious the service friendly and the ambiance lovely that said waiting 20 minutes in line plus an additional 30 minutes at mule table for a cold turkey sandwich wasn t worth it many of their items are cold sandwiches and considering it takes about 30 seconds to put some turkey on bread and sit it in a plate it must be a staffing or organizational issue they appear to deliver orders sequentially which doesn t seem to make sense here holding up cold items for the occasional hot one for me it was just over rated and far slower than it needed to be such a basic item
3503,in town from chicago and had some friends bring me here like the last thing i want is nashville s version of chicago fare but i wanted to watch the cubs game much to my surprise the pizza is awesome so are the mozzarella sticks and the decor and our server gina a chicago native she was so helpful sweet and prompt it was actually her birthday but she somehow made us feel special definitely going to come back next time in town hopefully she s working go cubbies
3504,i can t believe i haven t review penang yet i love this place it s a a very popular malaysian restaurant that offers pan asian food from indian to chinese you can find something that will impress anyone s taste with their extensive menu pricing is great for the huge amount of food in an entree i especially like the roti with chicken curry and chicken chow fun the food is very flavorful and there is ample seating despite always being very busy sometimes the staff is less talkative than would be preferred but that s because they re so busy i get takeout from here regularly and it s always ready within 10 minutes 5 5
3505,una experiencia deliciosa un lugar pequeo con mucho sabor para ser mi primera vez comiendo comida de estos pases muy rica el servicio muy amable hasta pudimos probar los gandules dulces se los recomiendo
3506,we invited friends to dinner when we selected saki they were hesitant as they had been there before love the food but had bad service we arrived about 7 pm on a friday night and the place was nearly full with just a few tables left we were seated immediately at a table for four the tables are a bit close with the angle of our table i was practically sitting in the next table we actually joked with them about it our server was pretty amazing she got drinks kept them refilled and took our first course orders she kept checking back and never made us feel rushed my husband and i started off sharing a number of appetizers we started with crab rangoon gyoza shrimp shumai and spring rolls the food came up pretty quickly considering how full the restaurant was the spring rolls were light and crisp the crab rangoon pretty standard the shrimp shumai was moist but the flavor was really blah the gyoza was horrible they were hard dry and not any better than we d buy in any supermarket the biggest challenge i have is with the food runners they have several young guys who seem to speak very little english they kind of grunt when they come to the table and food is shoved in front of you whether there is any room or not the portions are relatively small i completely understand that they will bring you as much as you need but the plates they use are huge for three small pieces of shumai and the guys running food spill all of the sauces out of the wells in the dishes for my second round i had the hot and sour soup it was very good not to think or heavy nicely spiced with lots of tofu and vegetables the seaweed salad was chilled a few kinds of seaweed nice flavor the chicken tempura was more tonkatsu breaded and fried crisp moist and crunchy but not a tempura batter i finished up with a philadelphia and a spicy tuna maki roll as well as some sashimi tuna salmon and escolar all three were well chilled thinly sliced and very fresh the salmon was super buttery the food was for the most part very well prepared the service won our friends over and its a great value for the endless dinner option
3507,really enjoyed the food here the staff is super friendly and guide you with the menu i ordered a chicken burrito and a green juice it was all very fresh and tasted great not bland the ambiance and vibe of the place is very young and cool to hang out or lunch during work they also have good options for vegetarians i d love to try out more from them my only complaint is that it is quite expensive my order total which i didn t see there and later saw on my card was 17 approx wow
3508,i took my sis here today for lunch we left her place headed for another restaurant that turned out to be closed on mondays i told our server i was tempted to send them a thank you card for being closed my burger was so fresh beautifully rare the fries were great as well nice and crispy w a good amount of seasoning sis had a chopped salad w her burger that she said was also very good apologies for failing to get pictures
3509,they have a wonderful tom kai soup and i always order egg rolls they can be very busy or have a table
3510,this place is fantastic the food is delicious i rate customer service five stars monday s they have burger specials
3511,we had a lovely time here for my boyfriend s birthday the food was excellent and the ice cream they brought to him for his birthday was delicious this location is still getting dialed in as it s pretty new but no doubt that it ll continue to improve it has been very busy every time we ve gone in for hh and dinner but we were still seated immediately
3512,they were on time and performed excellent work for a reasonable price would recommend to anyone needing new or repaired window screens
3513,cheu my boyfriend is obsessed with ramen so naturally we had to try cheu my only complaint is that the space is very small and tight with little seating but it kind of adds to the place s charm i love the decor very artsy and aesthetically pleasing i also love that you can watch the cooks prepare the food as for the food itself i was kind of skeptical i wouldn t classify myself as a picky eater but some of the combinations of items in their bowls was not what i would normally choose off of a menu so i tried the bbq chicken bowl i was pleasantly surprised it was beyond delicious the noodles weren t heavy and it was a perfect portion i was pretty stuffed a couple bites in i really loved the bbq sauce they used the combo of that and the veggies they included kept the bowl very fresh too i wasn t disappointed at all
3514,we took our pomeranian bear for his first visit here today we will definitely be taking him back in the future they are super friendly treated our boy like their very own family they even took the time to fit him into their busy schedule today the price was great the service was beyond our expectations
3515,elmers great cookie dessert oh my friendly bartenders who are often airing their woes behind the bar burgers were good i would visit again just not first choice
3516,love this place the food atmosphere are incredible it s so philly if you are a local you have to try it out to see what i mean oh make sure you order the brussels sprouts as your app the coconut curry ramen as your dish my personal faves
3517,this was such a fun and interactive event yelp and the owner ashly were so organized ashly and her staff were so friendly helpful and patient i m not so great at crafts and i was pleasantly surprised on how fantastic my sign turned out i would definitely make another art piece at board and brush again
3518,first of all this place is a hidden gem sent from heaven the food and the portions are amazing and i cannot wait to go back my wife and kids loved it mainly my wife because of the gin and tonic lol best smoke house in nj hands down
3519,i really like this boba tea place especially their rose oolong tea the bobas are soft but not too soft and chewy i stop by every time i crave for boba tea also their egg puff is good too you can have it with or without ice cream
3520,great italian food pizza is best in kop nice new building comfortable seating staff very pleasant
3521,the food is incredibly flavorful and absolutely delicious some reviewers must have some other ideas about mexican food the happy hour is an amazing deal and is good on saturdays too a huge improvement over the last place that was there service was slow when we went the first week they were open they seem to be figuring all that out as it is much better now no complaints and i am ecstatic i live right around the corner
3522,amazing this place should be on the top of everyone s list it s by far the best restaurant in sb amazing kaseiki meal and service
3523,what a charming vineyard nj really does have some fabulous wines we visited here yesterday and and had the 10 sampler tasting all wines were good we bought 2 bottles of sangiovese reserve and merlot the vineyard is beautiful and i ll definitely go back
3524,beautiful modern place they have a nice view the only thing is that is close to the train and you may hear it if you are on that side of the building other than that it s great and has a yolk on the corner
3525,i wanted to try a buffet while i was in town and this one was located in the casino i stayed at el dorado the price was right at 12 a person and the menu was eclectic they had pho italian barbecue some chinese and more my first plate was mostly meat and it was pretty damn good brisket pork spare ribs fried chicken roasted turkey prime rib italian sausage and bison sausage the cut of brisket i got was a little fatty and the turkey was dry but everything else was great for sides i got potato wedges which i drizzled with nacho cheese mac and cheese and spanish rice all of which were also delicious as far as the italian section i only got a slice of pepperoni pizza not the best pizza i ve had but nothing to turn your nose at i m not too big on sweets but i took a look at the dessert bar and it was pretty extensive as well same for the salad bar,the best pizza joint in spring city always nice and crispy never soggy the ingredients taste fresh and of good quality there s a decent little beer selection mostly domestic stuff but some craft options and lots of different wine cooler types there s a handful of tables if you want to eat there but it doesn t seem like many people do i take mine to go,this is my favorite bakery and deli the tomato pie is the best i ve ever had the rolls here too are amazing there s a deli counter where you can get fresh lunch meat or you can place a customer sandwich order the sandwiches are also great everything about this place is awesome they really know what they re doing at this place
3526,reading terminal is the place to be if you re hungry in philly cause of all the options i wasn t expecting it to be packed on a sunday late afternoon but oh well my friend and i looked around at a bunch of different places but this was the one that stuck out the most so we fought our way back over there were two lines for service so things went a lot faster the servers were nice and gave recommendations i got the gator gumbo while my friend had the cajun pasta we both added a side of cornbread cause who can resist that we found seats and dug in one bite and the heat was there the spice was heavy but so was the flavor every spoonful had gator chucks in it which i was not against in the slightest i had a bite of my friends pasta and that was just as good the cornbread consistency was closer to cake but it was still good i could only eat half since it was so thick would definitely grab a bowl to go next time i m in the area
3527,food was delightful nathan our server was awesome the wine he suggested was on point and so was the rest of his recommendations a meal for the memories
3528,this was my first time here and overall pretty great location is great in downtown franklin such a cute area it s nice to be able to wander in for a casual lunch without breaking the bank food is southern style pretty casual mostly sandwiches and salads i got the brisket taco salad and it was tasty the brisket clearly came with a lot of love and just melted on your mouth coworkers i was with had nashville hot chicken and pulled pork sandwiches which also looked tasty service was nice hospitable but a little on the slow side overall i ll likely be back
3529,the food here is great we usually are so excited to come here and get a delicious meal but the place is always crowded today we can in and it was empty but still a thirty minute wait this is ridiculous
3530,one of the nicest breakfasts that i ve ever had up north not to say that southern cooking is better but it s one of the nicest places i ve been
3531,i m in the process of eating healthier choosing this ketogenic diet has made finding certain foods and ingredients a little more challenging to find so i chose to look in your market i walked through the door near the barista station when a younger man gave me the most welcome greeting i ve ever received in any store i decided to start off my mission with a cup of joe after a few words of conversation i asked his name said thank you and from that point forward i had a great time in your store and the rest of my day was fantastic thank you very much damien cheers
3532,the good news is that it s fairly affordable the bad news is the long lines and the lack of seats onboard get there early if you want to sit through the 2 hour boat ride people seemed to be enjoying themselves though running around with drinks and plates of food the gift shop personnel were not attentive the boat crew though were quite friendly
3533,staying in music row we walked over to this cute shopping area and saw this cafe it was really hot and muggy even at 10am and we wandered in to the refreshingly cool air and friendly faces at the counter the stars are mainly for the nice place to sit in and chat with friends the sandwich i had was not revolutionary biscuit breakfast sandwich bacon was plenty and so was the egg and cheese biscuit was only alright not the best i have had in nashville ambience love the decor modern yet warm very clean comfortable seating and bright ambience people had laptops out and were working or chatting with friends over breakfast and or coffee seemed like a good place for both service really friendly
3534,granted they serviced me at 6 30 after calling all in all i ve had better pedicures i m grateful for the manicure and acrylic overlay the owner seems to be very knowledgeable i m only rating a 3 because i didn t get my paragon wax treatment which was boasted free i ll come back again
3535,my husband and i had an amazing dinner at suraya i was happy to get a table on a saturday night after reading about it in bon appetit the restaurant is bigger than i expected it is hip and modern with a relaxed vibe we loved all the food from the muhammara to the lebanese chai latte every bite was delicious the fresh from the oven pitas are unbelievable our server made great suggestions about how much to order and how to pace the courses we had 3 mezzas 2 entrees and more pitas than i want to admit i only wish we d had room for dessert overall an excellent experience
3536,if you re in the market for a new firearm or related supplies i suggest you check out indy arms company this place has been open for 2 yrs or so i m just now learning of its existence i ve been trying to hunt down a specific make model going store to store i finally struck oil lol this place is very clean appealing their range has very good lighting items are well priced staff provides friendly knowledgeable service located 2550 e 55th st just off of keystone they also have a good selection of concealed carry ready specialty purses bags for the ladies i will always suggest gun shows for variety bargains but as far as brick mortar stores go you can t go wrong here
3537,we had a technician pat king do some diagnostic work and maintenance on our two air conditioning units i can t say enough good things about him he was professional courteous and kept our house clean i would highly recommend unique indoor comfort and pat king to anyone looking for ac unit maintenance
3538,our go to pizza place pizza is always tasty and ready when you order great deal on tuesday and a little pricey on regular days
3539,great fish tacos and horchata i d recommend the combo 1 i ve gone here many times throughout my time in tucson and this was definitely my favorite fish taco spot in tucson and possibly all of the usa i ve visited so far shrimp tacos would be my second pick
3540,excellent customer service quick and efficient service thank you to alex and guy with a manager patch the oils change fluid checks tire fills and an air filter replacement took about 20 minutes cost was 85 which was a little price y but it was friendly and quick service
3541,the food and service is great a suggestion for improvement there should be a drink menu it s uncomfortable to ask bar tenders about the margarita and wine choices and their prices help us out have a menu
3542,i ve been to unique underground izakaya japanese restaurants in two other cities new york and melbourne new york s sake bar hagi is an awesome popular spot with a huge sake menu along with wonderful assortment of food izakaya den is a cool hip modern well hidden place to enjoy cocktails and small bites of food to your hearts content both were tricky to find being completely unmarked but awesome once discovered we visited them multiple times until we were able to try almost everything on the food and drink menus now the process of discovery starts again ichicoro ane on the other hand is well marked and easy to find but it too has an amazing menu of drinks and food that is definitely worth a try i think we re lucky to have the chance to experience this in st petersburg what other restaurant has a hallway designed for selfie photos an assortment of grilled meat on a stick for just a few bucks each a nice set of seafood and tofu dishes two kinds of bao buns several types of ramen and an amazing cocktail menu i think the answer is that this place is unique for sure we look forward to returning again and again,i always stop at this rest area because of three key features clean facilities a fresh ocean breeze an amazing view of tampa bay i always feel refreshed after stopping here and ready to finish the journey home via the skyway bridge drive safe
3543,it s ok definitely over hyped it s a step above ihop but nothing to write mother about
3544,the food and atmosphere are top notch but the service is even better request angel as your server and you re going to have a good time angel is the best
3545,had to comment because i was amazed at the furnishings and cleanliness of the bathroom oh and the food and service was spot on
3546,6 7 18 unique jambalaya omelet outstanding hash browns and biscuits coffee not good everything else was fantastic the staff was very nice nice home style feel
3547,venue clean large with indoor and outdoor seating plenty of room for large and small groups even areas with a pretty romantic vibe service horrendous our server literally hated her life or her job she came out to greet us and already was annoyed that she was about to serve 13 people who would ve tipped her more than 20 had she showed some enjoyment out of her job she only got 20 because of that reason she was miserable we don t even know why we paid with 1 card we all ordered all at once we only asked for additional beers it was the easiest table to serve i just can t imagine why she is working in the service industry when she clearly does not enjoy it hurts the company and restaurant nonetheless this is about the food more than the service just had to mention it though prices over the top pricey drinks to food small portions barely any alcohol in the mixed drinks just poor choice in costs when it comes to such poor qualities although the pizzas were enjoyed by everyone around the table but the other ancillary dishes were subpar the poutine not with poutine cheese the wings were bland beers pricey but again had plenty of selection so everyone eventually found their top choice 2 tiny tiny flights there are many other breweries in the area that have better pricing and beer selection i will say we ended up sitting outside in the humidity even though there were 3 large tables inside that had no one sitting at them they refused to let us sit there by the time we left 2 of those tables were still empty and remained open i don t understand their thinking behind refusing us we were a mix of all ethnicities and everyone was dressed well so i don t know how they judged us to stick us outside rather than let us opt for the inside table unfortunately it was such a poor experience will not be back hope for future customers to beware and proceed with caution happy eating and drinking
3548,the manager shawn bracken and our waiter clearly care about their customers and the entire experience at pf chang s they went above and beyond on a busy night to make sure we were taken care of will definitely be coming back to this location also recommended the korean chicken which is not on the menu but is phenomenal
3549,the best tuna burger outside of kazakhstan nice wine list cool decor hats hanging from the ceiling do not stand on the bar to put your head into one they frown on this found out the hard way staff is very friendly and welcoming would like to try the inn but would need to find a big reason to do an overnight in doylestown the dusk till dawn rave scene has apparently fallen out of favor there they have a cool lower floor but it s closed off during the day the only time i ve been there would like to give it a try some night appears dark and brooding seafood tacos rock as well very clean and tightly run outfit
3550,old church converted to coffee shop restaurant in down town eagle newly remodeled and much more modern than before staff is very friendly and attentive they have your normal coffee selections and pasties in the counter displays there is a separate restaurant sitting area for dinning or having your coffee at a table i want to really like this place but there are a few things that made me give them 3 stars for now one wait time it took us 30 minutes to get a table for 2 on sunday morning i get that it is post church and probably the busiest time of the week still don t like to wait that long 2nd tried ordering a meal off the menu for first time and the chile relleno quiche sounded good the quich was good but i was told it was layered with chilies saw a few diced pieces and covered in red sauce had a dollop in any event it tasted like a quiche with a little ranchero sauce guess i expected more flavor i will try rembrandt s again and give them another shot but probably not on a sunday afternoon
3551,after loving on the west coast for over 20 years i admit i m a sushi snob from the quality of the fish to the rice to the wasabi it all counts and tuna bar hits on all cylinders the wasabi is freshly grated i m looking forward to trying the other dishes as well but i m sure they will deliver as well
3552,empty on a wednesday at 6 love the sweet bartenders and frozen drinks come with a floater yum
3553,the alligator appetizer is delicious order it half fried and half grilled it s so good you don t even need the dipping sauce but the sauce is also good the voodoo juice drink is one my favorite mixed drink in new orleans i like the location which is right on jackson square by the cathedral plus the people watching is pretty interesting we ve enjoyed all the classics gumbo jambalaya red beans rice with sausage we will definitely be back
3554,this was our third trip and like the others it was so much fun the crew the boat the equipment were all fantastic we had a great day of fishing when we got back the fish were cleaned and we went next door where they cook them for you good eating highly recommend these guys
3555,awesome authentic mexican cuisine incredible decor great atmosphere great value great food

3558,had a great friday lunch fresh ingredients and service was friendly and fast the pork skins are so good to share and highly recommend the lamb burger will be back for dinner
3559,i took the kids here for lunch the other day while they were on spring break i ve been here a few times and forgot to review it dong s is the best chinese buffet in the area the one thing i don t like is you have to wait on the waitress for your drinks i d prefer to be able to get my own refills they have a large selection of food they keep the buffet fresh also during my last visit they were constantly switching out their food and adding freshly cooked food the only thing they re missing on their buffet is black pepper chicken maybe they have it on the dinner buffet i ve never been here for dinner so i don t know what changes on the dinner buffet for lunch though this is definitely a go to spot if your in the mood for chinese
3560,this place has really good food and the service here is amazing everyone is super nice and quick to accommodate i would definitely recommend for others coming to the area
3561,everytime i go here staff is friendly and fast food is delicious the wasabi goons are so addicting best crab rangoon i ve ever had the washington ave roll and mr kim s roll are my favorites but have had so many different ones that are all good too never have a complaint here i go all the time
3562,if you re in philly looking for a classic american brunch with amazing food then honey s sit n eat is the place to go cash only we came on a saturday morning at around 10 45am and waited about 20 minutes to get seated the restaurant has a quaint interior and you can tell it s been around for a while but that makes the place all the more charming the service was great and we got our food within 15 minutes we ordered the 10 three slices of challah french toast and the 14 honey cristo a challah french toast stuffed with ham and swiss cheese topped with two sunny eggs and served with a mixed green salad and they were both so good the challah french toast is some of the best french toast i ve ever had and there were so many delicious flavor bombs exploding together as i ate the honey cristo substituted bacon for the ham for more flavor and an added crispy texture this is a must try for any philly tourist,this was the best vegan food i ve ever had i ordered a 10 crispy hipcity ranch chicken sandwich and it tasted like a classic chicken sandwich but perhaps even better the flavors were so good and i quickly devoured the juicy sandwich this location also had really friendly service i ve tried their 4 banana whip at a hipcityveg food truck it was pretty good and is essentially healthy banana ice cream i m very tempted to go back again tomorrow and i d go vegan for a day a week if it meant i could eat here
3563,this is probably my favorite brunch spot great atmosphere service and always clean inside and out the weekend dishes are what my friends and i literally drag ourselves out of bed for in particular the breakfast poutine it s amazing i can t say enough about that dish the drink cocktail menu has changed a bit since p p opened we were sad about that but quickly got over it and now have new favorite brunch cocktails we visit at least every other weekend there is usually a wait if you show up after 10 00am but they provide complimentary coffee to enjoy check p p out,i ve only ordered take out or delivery from here the food is always consistent awesome pizza and salads the selection of beers is great too,fantastic steak margaritas and dessert i came here for my birthday dinner and i had the best time the side portions are huge and great for sharing i was so full from dinner yet the server gave me dessert to go on the house i really appreciated that and will not be waiting until my next birthday to go return i highly recommend charro steak
3564,why 3 stars my first visit was less than up to par the second was redeemed by some great guacamole and awesome server the main food was still a little hit or miss with being greasy and slightly over cooked but i am willing to look past it as a slammed night and give it another shot the flavor was good and i will be back to give them another shot at the elusive 4th or 5th star
3565,bakery house makes my favorite cakes ever my mom still surprises me with one every year for my birthday always vanilla with vanilla buttercream frosting they re fantastic better than any other cakes i ve ever had their designs tend to be pretty basic nothing intricate or entirely special my mom always orders the cakes so i can t speak to their customer service i ve tried a few other things over the years lemon bars cupcakes blondies and everything is always amazing their cakes freeze exceptionally well it s crazy try their cakes you won t be sorry
3566,was here for a visit and was craving a burger and this hit the spot also save room for the ice cream and shake
3567,we enjoyed a delicious tres leches birthday cake frosted and layered the bakery can decorate the cakes with chocolate or fruit or they will do movie characters etc for kids or in our case spider man for grown up kids i ve also sampled their pastries there is a huge variety and they are very inexpensive
3568,wanted to start close to the airb b i was staying at so i wondered down to this gem my favorite here was the live music with pianist the cocktail i had i believe was the muse and it was delicious love the environment friendly paper straws too i did try the bleu cheese stuff dates and honestly was not a fan didn t taste like there was cheese in there at all and the bacon that wrapped the dates tasted too burned for my liking
3569,great place hot dogs are really good my kids love it spreckter root beer on tap is brilliant fine family owned small business you can grab some good food and ice cream and not break the bank which is hard to do these days
3570,what to say about this place except i love the shopping experience i first walked into simons in montreal years ago and i was praying for it to come to edmonton now i have to control myself from going every week to find something to buy because i always do one thing to note is their tailoring seamless do like the west ed one more than londonderry but to each their own
3571,we are on our honeymoon and stayed just a block away we were looking for quality food without breaking the bank the food here surpassed our expectations and the waiting staff was always chipper and lovely thanks so much for your hospitality and wonderful food we recommend the grits seafood pasta and crystal chicken sandwich
3572,amazing music terrible wait so this is an amazing experience and the music is second to none this deserves 10 stars that said this operation is a little bit crazy and here is what you need to know and what should be on the website this aspect deserves negative stars 1 if you dont have reserved seats be prepared to wait 1 2 hours you are in line on the street in new orleans and there is no where to sit 2 if you arrive and your spot in line id beyond the door of pat o s next door you are not likely to get in and if you do then you will stand in the alley hallway gift shop 3 the whole experience us about 30 40 mins it is all paid yes after you enter the door and pay 20 50 you have to pay for requests not a single song free 4 the seating is hard benches and church pew cushions on the floor they should just sell tickets for the whole place and charge less for the floor
3573,very good food the churros with ice cream were pretty amazing nice atmosphere and a very friendly and helpful staff that accommodated my girlfriends food allergies a nice place off of state street
3574,my trainer kara b was great she kept me on track helped me gain muscle and worked out adaptations to accommodate my past injuries very knowledgeable and motivating i highly recommend her and the other trainers at platoon the facility was always clean and the manager was easy to get a hold of great location for people working around old city center city
3575,great pizza fast delivery i love there specialty pizzas and of course we can not get enough of the cups
3576,dan the man best driver ever he was super knowledgeable engaged with us at all the breweries and he s dj skills were also quite impressive impossible not to have a great time
3577,i had the cuban sandwich i love cubans and this one didn t disappoint i also had the chocolate cake i don t know if i d call it cake as it was mostly frosting lol great old italian market with a deli bakery wine shop and a place to eat this place gets busy but it s worth the visit
3578,professional dependable excellent work product knowledgeable of appropriate windshield for the vehicle courteous too
3579,it s very cute really outstanding service not too expensive and the food is really good
3580,solid stop for an airport sandwich or salad if you are a vegetarian desperately looking for something at the airport their veggie sandwich really hit the spot it includes avocado banana peppers roasted red peppers spring mix tomato and provolone the staff was also very nice
3581,staff was very freindly and place was clean good options for restricted diets like gluten free service was a little slow but food good reasonable pricing nice breakfast place i only took off a star for speed of service and the coffee was not great for a breakfast place i think good coffee is a must
3582,best chinese food around great flavor and not greasy like a lot tend to be war wonton broth actually tastes like broth not just flavory water as i have encountered reasonably priced 10 off if you pay cash with a good variety to choose from very family friendly it is now our go to for chinese food
3583,a lot of food a bit on the pricey side but i guess it was worth it for all you get i will advise when you get the bag it does have a lot of grease in the bag i had to take my food out and dab it on the napkin before i ate it unfortunately it doesn t come in a matter in which you can take it home unless you want to take home half grease and half food good experience but will not go back for a second visit
3584,this place was awesome it was my mom s first time my sister s graduation dinner and my god sister loved the fire pam was an awesome hostess our cook ben was amazing juggling two celebrations the manager steven was grateful to us
3585,israel food meets comfort food plus bacon if you are looking for something light and a little different this is your place service was good and friendly ambiance was hipster and trendy food is tasty and not crazy over priced good if you don t eat meat but there is bacon and other meat if you do i went during lunch and sat at the bar i didn t order a drink but there prices were in line with any other trendy bar the cocktails looked fresh but not over the top i ordered the whipped feta with honey and the country fried cauliflower i probably could have stuck with just the feta as the pita are pretty big and filling but it was worth it to try the cauliflower the cauliflower was a slightly spicy creamy on the palate dish and the feta had a nice juxtaposition between the salty of the feta and the sweet of the honey overall i m now stuffed content and ready for a nap mission accomplished
3586,my boyfriend and i tried out this place and we were surprised how good the food and service was despite it being packed my boyfriend ordered a hot pot soup and it was delicious i had the pad thai and love it very fast and attentaive service the vibe of the place is pretty cool too make sure to get outdoor seating it s beautiful and worth the wait
3587,this place has been a staple in the seminole heights area for a long time used to always go here when i was kid and then over the years with all the moving i never had a chance to go it s the perfect place to take your family staff is always courteous and they re very welcoming to big groups the pizza is absolutely awesome it s home made thick crust nice gooey cheese that s exact feel you should get from pizza from a local place that takes time to make it right the pizza does have a slightly longer turnaround so keep that in mind but it s always worth the weight my favorite thing off their menu other than pizza is the garlic bread we always get it extra crust but the inside is always so soft and the main reason for it being my favorite is the garlic it s garlic overload and i love garlic so i m a huge fan it s not for the garlic haters always a good time going here and love taking friend from out of town
3588,so delicious they were extra busy when we were visiting with a party of 6 plus a baby and everything was fabulous will definitely come back great food and attentive staff
3589,this place is busy at first i though i was going to be waiting a long time to be served not at all service was prompt and courteous and the food was incredible we ask the waiter for recommendations and he gave us the most delicious dishes my husband had the tuna i had the shrimp w grits best grits i have ever had
3590,favorite brewery in santa barbara area top notch ipa s and imperial stouts lots of experimentation and interesting brews
3591,we come to this joann s when we can t get what we need at michael s or ac moore and as you d expect this store is more fabric focused so we were able to get the adhesive and embellishments my 13 year old needed for a project no issues
3592,this coffee is actually good properly roasted and extracted coffee i was beginning to think this town only looked drip coffee 5 5 beans
3593,we had a vow renewal and made reservations for a party of 21 the general manager was very accommodating and super pleasant our servers were fernandez and katrina they were beyond amazing seriously the best service we ever received i was impressed by the general managers attention to detail the food was delicious the view was amazing and i will definitely return
3594,i m in st louis at least once or twice a month for work and this place is now on my go here every trip list it is sooo good portion sizes the small bowl is usually more than enough food but i ve also gotten the regular size when i was super hungry i also like that you can mix your fish scoops i like to do part salmon part spicy tuna with the spicy poke sauce toppings good variety generous servings and also really fresh i really love that mango is offered too and it is not an extra cost this is also where my only gripe comes in though i wish they d bring back the fried garlic it was one of my favorite toppings but when i went last week the girl working told me they didn t have it anymore and she wasn t sure if it would be coming back pokedoke please bring it back the fried wontons just aren t the same
3595,visited on a thursday evening and was seated right away we started with 2 large beers and a baked pretzel the pretzel was crunchy as it was cooked in a pizza oven i loved the texture but the flavor was pretty basic although the beer cheese dip and stone ground mustard was amazing dinner was a french dip sandwich and a bacon crusted cheese stuffed hamburger the french dip was amazing the meat was shaved which makes for an amazing sandwich the flavor of the hamburger was great but was a really thin patty on sourdough bread a little disappointed in the burger as i was looking for something a little bigger atmosphere was cozy and relaxing but loud if you are in the area i recommend stopping by
3596,evidently this is a reservation only restaurant but because we arrived right at open and almost every table was available they told us we could dine in but had to be gone by a certain time i appreciate accommodating us reservation only is a turn off the pizza was just okay i thought it was going to be really delicious but i felt it was a bit under cooked the other person who ate it said the same thing maybe just a little too much sauce for our taste as well other meals were spaghetti with meatballs and chicken parm both said they were good i had the smoked salmon with pasta in a cream sauce and it was pretty good as well portion sizes are a bit small for the price but the quality is there so that made up for it their location was great parking is available and we didn t have an issue finding a parking space on the street it is located on a cute street with other shops and restaurants byob is an awesome option our waiter was very nice maybe a little too serious but he did his job well a lady walked around and asked the tables if they were enjoying their experience and that was nice of here the decor isn t necessarily my taste and maybe a bit outdated it s a small dining area and the tables are close together however it didn t bother us background music or something would have been nice i was torn between a 3 or 4 star review i d give it 3 5 stars if i could
3597,it s nice the hookas are ok burns quickly no alcohol just few beers the music is weird at times it s a chill atmosphere though
3598,from the first time connecting with coleen to chelsea and her team on site during the wedding day my wife and i felt butler s pantry went above and beyond in their service our venue was a blank slate so butler s pantry had to bring in everything they did not disappoint and our reception looked amazing the chairs table place settings and buffet display were beautiful all of our guests raved about how good the food was and how beautifully the buffet was displayed the servers even went and asked kids who didn t originally sign up for a kids meal if they wanted one and made it happen we had multiple food allergies and the staff was wonderfully accommodating and everything was served to the correct people we knew the night was going to go well when we arrived at our outdoor ceremony reception venue during 90 degree heat after taking bridal party photos and 3 staff met us with water and kept checking on the whole bridal party the whole staff checked on us throughout the night and the staff leaders checked on us before they left at the end of the evening they were all wonderful kind helpful professional and the food tasted amazing we are so glad we chose butler s pantry
3599,i had just watched a spring training baseball game and was looking for a good place to eat never been to ybor city and want to check it out checked yelp and this place came up restaurant was busy but found a table right away i ordered carolyn s double play combo i chose for my meats pork ribs and the dark meat chicken my two sides were potato salad and yellow rice and chicken service was quick and friendly food was delicious ribs were perfectly seasoned and tender the chicken was flavorful and moist rice was good nothing special but the potato salad was delicious friends i was with had collards greens which i tasted cooked perfectly and spicy only disappointment was banana pudding was sold out but the omg loved up to it s name overall just an amazing experience with delicious food and a friendly staff that will definitely have us come back again
3600,we were looking forward to a nice dinner at tre lune for our anniversary unfortunately we were very disappointed our waitperson was very cold and abrupt with our service there was simply zero interaction if this was a diner i would overlook this but not a restaurant serving a community such as montecito
3601,the best cheese steaks around such nice and friendly staff don t think i have ever had any issues
3602,great new spot in malvern so nice to see a change of pace and more unique than anything else around great food good service and tasty beverages chicken albondigas and calamari were excellent starters and very flavorful entrees were all great and pizza was perfect to share in addition to entree definitely check it out
3603,i haven t tried the food yet but i ve sat at the bar and had a few drinks with friends great atmosphere friendly bartenders great selection started with wine ended with long islands will be back
3604,the saint autograph hotel is hands down the best hotel i ve ever stayed at i literally just checked out and i m already planning my next stay at the saint the hotel is super clean and very cozy lovely decor which made for awesome pictures i m a huge fan of the decorative walls oversized chairs and photo props the staff was amazing i can t thank tyson special k lea enough we checked in with tyson who was warm and bubbly minutes later the bellman special k came over and greeted us with his lively personality both tyson and special k suggested awesome restaurants clubs and stores we literally fell in love with every place they suggested both gentleman checked in with us often to make sure we continued to have an awesome experience they treated us like family they really went above and beyond the saint is beyond amazing mucho kudos to their staff the bartenders in the burgandy lounge room service staff to our new family tyson and special k we truly appreciate you again thank you for the great experience
3605,this place is a staple in indianapolis over in the international marketplace most people who have been around the city long enough and explore ethnic food have tried this joint now with so many other vietnamese restaurants opening all around the city there is a lot of competition i think that saigon still fares pretty decently to the others in town for one the menu is extensive most vietnamese dishes that one would seek in larger more diverse metro areas are present on this menu secondly the portions are very fair for the price taste is good imo however the quality of the meat is questionable my wife is much more on the meat picky and mostly vegetarian spectrum than myself but the way she qualifies a vietnamese cuisine is based on grilled meat quality as she is a bn lover i agree with her most of the time and on saigons behalf i agree meat quality mediocre at best otherwise definitely worth trying out
3606,the food was decent i thought it was a nice place open with plenty of seating including some comfy couches they have tvs and a nice setup outside so i think i ll visit again in the summer since it s about an hour from my home good happy hour specials and prices and tons of beer to choose from obviously i thought the bartenders were very friendly but seemed to stay towards one side of the bar making it hard to get their attention at times overall a good experience and i will be back
3607,been here a couple times the in laws love it you can feed 4 with left overs for less than 60 bread pudding unique
3608,delicious food and friendly owners but the place was significantly run down not comfortable and the atmosphere was bland i would go back just don t have a first date there
3609,my boyfriend and i needed a quick bite and wanted some solid pizza we were not disappointed this place was so good the pizza slices are huge and they put so much toppings on speciality slices you will not be disappointed oh and the mozz sticks are perfect i recommend x10 for some solid pizza etc in philly cute little place love the local feels
3610,amazing ham dynasty is an interesting execution of really good asian food it s family style which means they bring each dish out as soon as it s ready and you re supposed to share and when they say as soon as it s ready they mean within 5 minutes of your order we were amazed at how fast the food came out and our server was extremely nice and helpful the menu also has helpful numbers to indicate how spicy each dish is going to be we had a few different dishes for the table and polished them all off because we loved almost everything we ordered this place is really a tremendous dining experience
3611,cheryl was absolutely fantastic in helping us with our wedding cake we had a destination wedding to new orleans may 11th and it was a very small intimate wedding our cake was 2 tier almond cake with vanilla buttercream oh my word it was beautiful with the ruffle piping and it was the most delicious thing i had ever tasted if i had to do it again the only thing i would do different is order a bigger cake so we could have had more to take home
3612,this is right down the street from my house and job so i usually try to go once a week or so but this has became my favorite breakfast restaurant i usually take things to go i m always so pleased i usually order the mocha with extra whipped cream it s sooo smooth has a good taste the sandwiches are amazing depending on which sandwich you eat you have a choice of the cheese and what s in it i love that it s small it gives a real italian feel when you walk in
3613,this place has awesome craft beers food and company bartenders are knowledgeable fun and really make the place great will definitely be back
3614,good sushi everything tasted fresh the fried rice and seaweed salad were delicious too service was great we went on a monday night around 7 30 and there were only a few other people eating very reasonable prices too couldn t believe the glasses of wine were only 4 i will definitely be returning or getting take out from here sometime soon
3615,the chocolate malt shakes here taste really good my daughter and i both actually got a headache right as we were done drinking the shake it was pretty sweet but tasty the ladies running the place were sweet but a bit slow kids liked taking pictures at this location but was not my favorite
3616,the store has such advanced technology they have a tablet specifically targeted to help you find the right vape based on your flavor preferences and smoking history they have hookahs vapes juuls cigars and any other possible smoking products they also have sage in case you want to rid your house of any bad juju not to mention they have amazing service i will definitely be back
3617,staff friendly plenty of seating nice view of the water when sitting outside which is where we sat inexpensive and quick service no line nothing over the top average diner breakfast i ordered a basic breakfast buttermilk pancakes and sausage links restaurant had paper straws kinda tasted funny with whatever you drink only thing i didn t like birds around but just mostly on the ground not borthering anybody
3618,always good food the grilled fish is one of our favorites prices are reasonable too
3619,love this place great staff fast good atmosphere great place to work and definitely the best coffee in st pete
3620,typical 15 burger joint went on a sunday afternoon they were pretty busy but luckily we were able to be seated immediately odd half booth half table seating with semi uncomfortable wood seats and backrests to match the wood tables they do have odd long pillows you can sort of use for added backrest comfort lots of kids families our server was great and all the other servers who helped her out everyone was very pleasant i had the mushroom onion swiss burger with sweet potato fries and a side of regular fries the burger was decent it could have been cooked less and it would have been much better sweet potato fries were good i just wish they didn t pre salt them a little salty for me the regular fries were also just ok honestly they didn t taste super fresh i can t say i would never go back here and try something new but just keep in mind you can get similar burgers at half the price at competing restaurants the ambiance was 50 50 the overall decor was nice loud but it was full packed with customers the seating cushions were filthy with food remnants if i do go back i d like to try something new and request the burger to be cooked at a different temp
3621,absolutely one of my favorite places in florida the crab shrimp quesadilla is so good
3622,best service in town with competitive prices and great people a little out of my way i drive 22 miles but well worth it
3623,omg what a great addition to our community physically this restaurant is just beautiful i haven t sat anywhere outside that felt so utterly lovely in well ever there are tables lounges open flow to the bar and you sit among tree branches and delicate glowing lights just stunning with so much outdoor seating they were also dog friendly my dog s presence made the experience feel like a real social occasion as various other diners including young children came by to say hi the wait staff and host were very friendly and attentive so that was also a big thumbs up and finally the food we ordered a lot of variety and we got a lot of food no skimpy portions here everything was delicious although the pad thai as a gf option was a bit chewy i d probably skip that if i went back but again how amazing to be a vegan at a restaurant and able to order pretty much anything off the menu and have it be delicious and well presented as well oh and they carry a lot of local sb county wine which is always a plus in my world lucky day to live close to this new restaurant
3624,just stopped for lunch today and the pizza was delicious and fresh definitely will be back the location is great get to watch people coming and going on the trail i ll be back
3625,great selection of vintage gear and friendly staff scored some vintage athletics shirts and hats i only wish there were more women s selection loved the store
3626,it s ok but as someone from texas that knows her barbecue this will not be a place that i return to it s pricey for what it is and it s just not that great the service was really good and the drinks are pretty awesome but if you re looking for authentic barbecue at average market price this isn t it this is more of a barbecue style of their own and it s pricey it has a cool location and the service is friendly and prompt
3627,yum the burgers are juicy and worth every calorie but the boozy shakes are the cats pajamas i had the nutella shake and it was mind blowing variety of really neat beers on tap at all times family friendly too epic place worth seeing while in gulch
3628,interesting menu i ordered the grilled chicken thighs with farro gochugaru sriracha like sauce mint and cilantro balanced dish good textures and perfectly cooked protein we shared homemade biscuits with herb cream cheese honey and black pepper and they were excellent wife had grilled cheese with cranberry and walnut raclette and gouda cheese and a black truffle honey good flavors but lacking in texture we couldn t identify the fruit or nuts and i couldn t taste any truffle in the honey though there were visible shavings was delicious but not very well balanced and felt very heavy she at half and saved half for later i enjoyed a cocktail infused with cbd oil very tasty i like that there are no substitutions no reservations and no straws here we came around 10 30 for brunch we were seated around 11 15 and finished our meal around 12 15 would return again
3629,impromptu dinner traveling through the area great to find a local place open for dinner early everything we ordered was very tasty pork belly chicken blue cheese burger falafel burger reasonable prices for great food waiter was attentive
3630,solid pizza and pasta dinner with creative toppings and sides interesting combination of ingredients and fresh toppings really liked our dinner and the decor of the new location surprisingly not crowded for all the buzz i ve heard but its a week night in st louis county i really thought their pizza dough was really good not sure i would order the black pasta again however
3631,the st pete beer bacon festival was more beer than bacon and smaller than the usual festivals i am accustomed to it was well organized and not too crowded we purchased the vip drink tickets so we were able to beat the lines by getting in an hour early most of the breweries that were in attendance were located in the tampa bay area so we tried to focus on the breweries that were from out of town first my festival favorite was from seminole the gose from rapp brewing food options included a variety of food trucks and vendors in booths selling desserts and a few bacon themed items in addition to food there were also local vendors selling items from clothing to jewelry this festival was not the most exciting one but the venue of vinoy park and the great weather made it bearable we have checked this one off our checklist and will pass next time it is in town
3632,awesome live music truly captures the essence of what n awlins has to offer the signature cocktails are pretty interesting
3633,great food and reasonable price loved being able to have burger in lettuce wrap also had grilled chicken club salad really good too
3634,excellent customer service attention to detail clean worth the price cash is better since there is a surcharge for credit cards on time service
3635,i made a reservation for about 10 for a birthday brunch they don t normally take reservations but we re very accommodating for my party when i got there i ended up waiting 35 minutes past my reservation time to get seated which was not ideal however once seated we were treated to some appetizers to compensate for the wait which was great of management in addition our service was very good and very accommodating even though the restaurant was super busy the menu has a huge selection and everything is super tasty the mimosa brunch was totally worth it and went great with the food
3636,great spot in the heart of the french quarter do yourself a favor and don t consider ordering anything other than the bbq shrimp if you look up the recipe it s shrimp that s drowning in a flavorful butter sauce and as you d expect it s amazing worth a stop for lunch or dinner when you re in nola
3637,some of the best food i ve had in florida scallops are perfect as is the grouper great food great drinks and great atmosphere on the water
3638,so delicious the chicken mango light spicy was sweet and tasty i ordered coconut flavored rice since the server informed me that dish doesn t come with rice it was the perfect complement my companion s seafood with crispy noodles had more broth than he would have liked and not enough shrimp or squid mostly scallops the atmosphere was lively and the service friendly
3639,we stopped in here a couple times over the weekend and the first time it was so packed we couldn t even get to the bar and our claustrophobia encouraged us to try back another night the bar is small and when the band is set up expect to get comfy with those around you we revisited again on a weekday and had a chance to see why this is such a popular place the prohibition vibe is reinforced from the bartenders to the design and decorations to the jazz band and the fantastically retro black and white movies playing over the bar there s only a couple small bistro tables but they have charming little candles flickering in the center adding to the mood and ambience the bartenders were great and made us quality artisan beverages and were nice when we prompted them about gf status of their sweet and sour the jazz bands we heard both nights were poppin and it s easy to see how between the excellent drinks the great music and the prohibition theme this place stays so busy the drinks are a little pricey but the atmosphere definitely makes up for it if you want to enjoy the french quarter but the cheap beer and slew of drinks on bourbon street aren t your thing this is your place
3640,my husband i enjoyed a delicious dinner at maria s last night the hostess waitress colleen all staff were so friendly attentive we had eggplant involtini as an appetizer salmon in a tomato sauce with mussels clams chicken parmesan i highly recommend all these dishes maria s
3641,food was fantastic view perfect atmosphere is quaint it was a gorgeous day to sit in the patio we had the corned beef eggs and hash and the banana foster french toast as well as a burger it was all delicious the waitress was super sweet also
3642,thoroughly average cheesesteak at phl airport terminal f the bread was mushy the steak was chopped up way too fine cheese was good and the meat and veggies seemed to be of good quality but this place didn t really do it for me the staff was very friendly and the fries were delicious
3643,wow awesome food great service top notch entertainment great place for a night out with friends unique experience highly recommended
3644,i have had good and bad experiences with espresso and this is definitely one of the better ones i got the espresso bombn which comes with condensed milk at the bottom and it surprisingly was the perfect sweetness i like my coffee still a little bitter and it was perfect the place itself is nice and quiet and the staff is very friendly
3645,omg i came here one night after going out and the food and drinks were great i came back today to make sure it was as good as i thought and it is love the circle 7 chicken wrap and the cherry whiskey smash,awesome place i love the food they were friendly i ended up having them cater my sons graduation party carol is great
3646,the food here is hit and miss especially lately the popcorn chicken was excellent the first few times but the last two times it was overly salty and soggy the noodle dishes are sometimes bright and fresh but other times are soggy and boring
3647,1st visit love this place the food was delicious lots of curry jerk chicken wings oxtail brown chicken stew service was amazing too will definitely return
3648,this restaurant is one of the very few indian restaurants that we have tried so far and i should say that it s the best taste by far the only concern we had is their spice level was too high other than they had a great taste and creativity in making modern indian food
3649,a gem of a find when were tired of the same old restaurants in the area we never heard of this place before they have a nice selection of gluten free options the pizza was very good when ordering the pasta you get salad and a huge basket of rolls plain or garlic the pomodoro has a little kick but all in all everything was delicious and i highly recommend this place
3650,yum i ve tried about 3 different things from this place now over the last few months i ll be back green bowl is delicious and has great balance
3651,this place is great fresh ingredients quality product and great staff i m looking forward to coming back and trying their calzones as well as other specialty pizzas i can see this being a place that i patron weekly
3652,great views nice pool area and clean well maintained good seating around bar only negative is that beer is too expensive
3653,the atmosphere and service are great but the high prices aren t justified by the quality of the food overall i was hoping this would be my new favorite spot but the price is too high
3654,food was delicious and the best service i ve ever had at an airport lucy was a great conversation partner and i had a terrific experience all around would recommend
3655,this is the as good as any other bbq i ve had in indianapolis locally and family owned and operated a great business to support
3656,i m not quite sure why this is grouped with best black owned business when it s not black owned unless i am mistaken
3657,awesome place on broadway in nashville music was better than most great entertainment had deep fried chicken was tasty once you get past the breading only first floor was open with a 15 minute waiting time
3658,great service and yummy bar food drinks are strong and the atmosphere is great our server was wonderful and so accommodating loved it here and would definitely come back
3659,i had a great experience purchasing a watch it was great and received many compliments but it had a flaw in bezel i went to the store and spoke with a manager she was very helpful followed up with me the next day after speaking with her repair team a replacement watch was ready for me when i arrived no haggling no concerns or proving the damage etc great customer service experience all around i m a very pleased customer thanks aubrey you guys rock,fun clean classy moderately priced good looking crown and amazing food and service zero complaints livery is my immediate go to for me my crew and family go there now
3660,hearthside is good but not quite as amazing as vernick if that s what you re looking for i tried the ceviche the kale salad and the scallops all were very excellent however my friend and i found the desserts really disappointing we ordered the almond cake and the chocolate babka i thought the babka was a really unbalanced dessert too overly sweet and the almond cake was just underwhelming maybe we should have gotten the blueberry fritters instead
3661,visited new hope on beautiful summer day we walked past the restaurant it s going to be pretty busy we were sat right away service was great quality of food was spectacular the ahi tuna was so fresh and delicious really enjoyed the pineapple salsa that came with it my husband ordered the halibut special and it also was tasty the only disappointment was that the moscow mule drink was not served in proper glassware i did also think it was a bit pricey in comparison to the quantity of food served would come back
3662,the food was good had a dosa and a vada the flavors were there the place was sort of in the middle of nowhere the cleanliness of the place looked suspect i may not venture there again good luck to them
3663,clean safe and automatic doors favorite laundromat i have been too the prices are fair and there is plenty of room to fold comfortable waiting area too
3664,this review is about the lookout which is the top floor of ole red it has a different menu when you get tired of bar food or just want a superb meal this is the place to go we are seafood lovers and this was some of the best we have ever eaten including at the gulf they have a raw bar and you pay by the item we ordered two alaskan king crab legs a dozen raw oysters a dozen boiled shrimp we also got their special huge pretzel with great warm queso dip which was very good the seafood was amazing most of the reviews on here are for the main floor food don t stop there go to the roof top we can t wait to go back delicious we were a group of four and had plenty of food view was also great
3665,they have ube they just opened and it s an aesthetically pleasing place for you instagram peeps they have a few different flavors like matcha or ube when i walked in the owner was really really nice and helped me out with my order i got one of their curated flavors ube baby baby which by now you should know ube is my favorite flavor ube baby baby came with ube soft serve vanilla cake and condensed milk it was delicious i would totally come back and bring other people with me it seems like a really chill place to hang out with friends or a place to grab dessert
3666,my sister and i stumbled across the town of dunedin and kelly s chicka boom we stopped for lunch we both ordered the shrimp bisque which was the daily soup special i think we both licked the bowl it was so so good my sister ordered wings i don t normally care for wings but these were the tenderest wings i ve ever had and delicious i also ordered the brussels sprout appetizer it needs a dipping sauce i used sriracha and i was fine they were also delicious it was so good we went back for dinner we split the steak sandwich it was enough for us to split probably not to split with my hubbie though also really good would order any or all of it again on a different trip super friendly staff and crowd great outdoor back patio with music
3667,this is my second time visiting and food was yet again superb the free salsa is to die for so spicy i had the nachos garcia and they were absolutely amazing the plate could probably feed 3 people for only 10 can t beat it
3668,stopped in again not too long ago and as always the food was superb only thing that was a downer for me was that my last few visits they were out of the chicken wings again sometimes you know you have a craving and headed there to fill it but was just unfortunate they were out still love the restaurant and the staff but hoping my next visit they have the chicken wings i have been waiting to have hopefully see you soon
3669,my and my friend went there for dinner and our waitress yaya gave excellent customer services and made sure we were happy so if you ever go there ask for yaya
3670,this sushi restaurant is seriously legit the fish is incredibly fresh and their selection rocks every other place in town the service is excellent and they even have gluten free options for celiacs silvia one of the owners is extremely helpful and patient love this place it seriously gets two thumbs up
3671,does this place have excellent boba and a wide selection of drinks yes it does for product they are very very good but like some of the other reviewers they don t know how to implement a loyalty card program i filled up my card buying mostly the regular size snow smoothies but then when i tried to use the card regular size was a 50 cent up sell i think they even charged me for boba it just pissed me off bad enough that i didn t come back for a year sure it is only 50 cents or whatever but it was the principle it didn t make me feel like a special customer it made me feel like a chump
3672,only restaurant near hotel that sounded good i haven t tasted the food and i m already in love special appetizer is oysters rockefeller tough choice since they also have toasted ravioli and frogs legs no problem i can order any appetizer by the piece wow two frogs legs and two toasted ravioli coming as well omg i m full on a side note jess my server bartender is one of the nicest people ever
3673,this was a nice little restaurant to stop at while visiting smyrna in an airbnb the food was absolutely delicious and i would love to eat here again the only issue was the extended wait time on a sunday when the restaurant wasn t real that busy it seems like maybe they are a family only run restaurant and they didn t have enough staff to help refills were only offered once we ran out of syrup for our table and it took a while to get some back at our table so one of the girls had to eat her french toast cold it is a small restaurant so if you have more than 5 6 people in your group you won t fit overall it was a good experience but from the previous ratings i expected a little more
3674,simply stated they are true to their word as it relates to having discounted furniture that is less expensive than your name brand furniture stores the staff was friendly they definitely don t follow you around the store however they get a ding for customer service because they don t seem to be as knowledgeable about the furniture products furniture quality is a mix ranging from low to moderate quality at the end of the day if you are looking for less expensive furniture or to get a good deal or to find a unique accent pieces this is the place to be i mean i saw the same sectional for 1 000 less than the name brand store now that s a deal
3675,i never write reviews so you know this had to be good in order for me to do this i was unfortunately given bad information 3 times about the books for the nursing program and because of this i didn t purchase during the sale after hearing from a fellow student that they were in fact carrying them i was a little irritated because i could have purchased them when they were cheaper i called to explain this to them and mark went above and beyond to correct this situation not only did he offer to hand delivered my books but he honored the sale price i have to say this was some of the best customer service i have ever received when it comes to anything unr related highly recommend
3676,the food was amazing and the service was exceptional i ordered the cheeseburger and it was cooked perfectly we didn t make a reservation so we sat in the outdoor patio area which was covered and had a nice ambiance if you don t want a wait i would recommend a reservation because it seemed to get pretty busy on the weekends
3677,this is a super cool place have been wanting to go here for so long and glad i was able to go here today good lunch menu i had a big glee to see so many veggie options obviously it s a veg vegan place the food was yumm the service was prompt the place is so cool bright and fresh loved the clean design they also have an outdoor seating which is an aded
3678,i absolutely love this place the food is superb the wine is great the atmosphere is cozy but still feels trendy i ve been here several times now and each time we closed the place down it s just a great place to sit enjoy your meal and have a long conversation with your friends one of my favorite dishes is the skirt steak 17 it s a tasty perfectly seasoned cut of meat just the right amount of salt and fat and lime on it i tried the chicken empanada and the mushroom one and by far liked the chicken one better i ve also enjoyed the paella with shrimp which i had during devour indy my only complaint was that the serving was a little small for me and i was still hungry afterwards but the delicious chocolate flan and the churros that followed that meal remedied that problem i would recommend this place to anyone whether it s for a business meeting or an evening out with friends
3679,aside from the slow service the food was really good this is about to seem weird but the coleslaw from this place omg feom the soup to the chargrilled oysters to the fish platter everything was on point the cute little lady greeting everyone was an extra bonus
3680,this has been our go to restaurant for any night out for the last year everything is delicious but you can t go wrong with the cauliflower sweet plantains red drum and paella to name a few their drinks from the bar are exquisite but i always order a livery margarita with salt well two or three over the course of dinner if i m being honest the atmosphere is fun and exciting the staff are friendly and accommodating and if you can get a seat on the roof then it doesn t get much better than that we love everything about this place if anyone from out of town visits we take them here for the unique experience and tasty dishes
3681,quaint cozy little sushi spot hidden in a corner of montecito i would say it s the best sushi in the santa barbara area for sure i usually get sashimi so just raw fish with no rice or seaweed that s the best to really taste the quality and freshness of their fish and their fish is truly fresh i feel like i am tasting the ocean in my mouth in the best way possible and their house sake is great goes well with the sashimi i usually get
3682,i dropped off a bike to have two flats fixed said i needed one tire when i picked up the bike it had a new tire and a almost new tire he said he had laying around no charge i recommend this local business
3683,i thought i had found the world s best chicken and waffles until i went here what a great place in dt nola my friend took me to brunch and she had the omelet and i had a tough time choosing but ultimately took the waitress s advice and i couldn t have been more pleased the pepper jelly is so fresh the chicken is so moist the waffles are so fluffy and whatever cinnamon butter with which they top the waffles is divine we also had a dozen oysters on the half shell so fresh and clean i couldn t recommend this place more for a really nice brunch experience
3684,just tried this place for the first time today and i m so sad because i ve been living here for four years and now i m just discovering it super fresh breads ingredients home made soups similar to fife and dekel but without the pies reasonably priced and it s got a grandma s sandwich shop feel to it in the best way possible i got a montreal meat sandwich and the pastrami barley soup both were so good and i can t wait to come back here again
3685,i do a ton of shipping from various auction houses and craig and his team have been the most pleasant dependable and easiest to deal with by far i find their prices have been fairly reasonable and competitive and i haven t had many of the issues that i have had elsewhere i m very happy to have found them
3686,gorgeous interior and upbeat atmosphere since i m new to nashville i enjoy checking out some of the more popular places in town and caviar bananas did not disappoint ample amounts of seating large lattes that are actually large and everything you could imagine for satisfy your appetite wine check sweets check savory lunch sandwiches check i ordered a large iced caramel latte with jalapeo cheddar grits and oh my those grits soothes my soul i love everything c b has to offer and i cannot wait to become a regular
3687,my boyfriend and i tried this deli for the first time today i had a turkey avocado bacon panini and he ha a buffalo chicken wrap we will definitely be returning the wait for food wasn t too long which is always appreciated during lunch hour there was so much to choose from they have salads soup macaroni sandwiches and hot food i love a deli that has many options to choose from
3688,cutest little breakfast place with amazing food i got the veggie burrito with avocado and it was fantastic the outside was grilled crispy and the insides were cooked with just the right amounts of spices and hints of garlic the potatoes were an excellent touch it was super filling so come hungry
3689,had so much fun here tonight the kitties were so adorable and cute the sample sweets we got were delicious and the coffee was super fresh this is the perfect place to be to end a busy week of work and stress nothing like warm and cute little fluffy bodies for cuddles and a warm drink to sooth your soul and to melt the coldness of the outdoors away will definitely be coming back here all the kitties that they have at this location are adoptable the cats are super cute and cuddly and sweet there were a few sleepy heads and a few little odd balls that wanted to be left alone but most were adorable and social
3690,this was our fifth time eating at berlin s donner marie greeted us sat us down and started to explain but told her i ve been here many times and now just bringing my sister she had the sausage plate which consisted of three different types of sausages german potato salad and sauerkraut since she has been to germany many times she said this is authentic and absolutely delicious i had my usual chicken donner which is always delicious and usually enough for two meals after reviewing the 16 types of german beer that come in every 48 hours we selected one and it was unbelievably delicious with 16 beers available on tap it s also the best priced beer in the entire area and tastes like a microbrewery i was glad to see a steady stream of people coming in to eat and drink and the ihop next door was totally empty we are so happy to have a delicious place to eat and drink in our neighborhood don t forget to order the apple strudel with homemade vanilla ice cream you will not believe how good it is
3691,the donuts the donuts the biscuits the cinnamon roll yas and i love yalls waffle fries come here for just a donut not going to happen call up your friends and family and ask them if they would like one because the flavors are out of the world and what is better than a doughnut sampler great place and great values love the ice coffee too
3692,if you like a bar and beer tap environment this place is for you being on a calorie restrictive diet i opted for the thai chicken salad which was excellent in my opinion i also enjoyed a cigar city ipa on tap i would definitely recommend this place as a place to wind down after a hard day
3693,about 6 or 7 years ago we bought a riccar vacuum cleaner from the speedway store it has been pretty reliable and am satisfied with it not that i am such a maven on vacuuming or my favorite pasttime we always get our bags at the store well we haven t been here for at least a year that s how long a package of 6 lasts the store was nice before but they have since added so much more i m not a sewing person but the selections are enormous on all sorts of machines they have a few brands of vacuum s as well i believe that they offer classes the gentleman who waited on us was friendly and spoke to us about possibly updating our old vacuum it s a sewing and quilting persons dream store
3694,the food was delicious and the service was great the unlimited mimosas were powerful if you re ever in new orleans be sure to eat at kathie s being from california i didn t care for creamy grits
3695,love onecupjoe first off the concept of ocj as a whole is awesome i love waking up to a different brand and flavor of coffee every morning and i feel like i am getting a good value for the amount of product that leave with as soon as i walk in the door the owner is quick with a friendly greeting and cordial conversation quick to offer assistance and to introduce me to new products his brand of customer service is such a rarity and keeps us coming back almost as much as the products themselves
3696,food was basic but really good i had a broiled grouper sandwich that was perfectly cooked and very good the best part is that you could really taste the grouper because it was not hidden in some sort of sauce my daughter had the hilly cheesesteak which was really delicious and not greasy the service was very good and friendly this place was clearance and not fancy but very good right across from the beach
3697,i have no idea why this place has 3 5 stars the food is fantastic i got my order to go so my review is based on that i ordered potato skins and their fried chicken dinner everything was delicious if you order it to go definitely get the complimentary bread
3698,the food and ambiance for the jazz brunch was amazing we ordered the tomato stack which was so goood it came with a bbq finish and shrimp in between such a tasty surprise for my entree i ordered shrimp and grits i d have to save one of the best shrimp and grits dishes i ve ever had and as a southerner that s saying a lot would definitely return
3699,we came here for drinks while we were on a trip to look at real estate we drove by this place a few times the gorgeous building is hard to miss and finally got them time to go in we only stayed for drinks as we had a flight to catch first off the atmosphere is amazing if i was planning an event or wedding in reno this would be at the top of my list we sat at the bar and had a great conversation with the waiter we tried a flight of their homemade spirits which were incredible this place definitely shows what reno has to offer
3700,this is one of my favorites in armature works the sangria the cuban and the guava pastry empanada is amazing probably my favorite in all of tampa not too mention they just won best cuban sandwich at the cuban sandwich festival hemingway s is a fantastic addition to armature it won t disappoint guys this place is delicious byefelicia
3701,this little restaurant is always so good it s perfect for a quick lunch or relaxing dinner they have lunch deals to help you save money and there is always parking up and down the street the boba is delicious and they have a ton of flavors i recommend it for a cloudy day or mellow date night service is always decent no real complaints there
3702,i was expecting to be wowed but just wasn t i ordered the chicken tenders with mac n cheese and cornbread the chicken and mac n cheese were okay cornbread was very good my husband ordered a burger the char on his burger made it taste like charcoal sauce on it was very good though the service was excellent people were extremely friendly plenty of seating and a relaxed atmosphere,this place is amazing the wait was longish but they had plenty of places to wait i love that they have a pick 2 option so my husband and i both opted for soup and sandwiches i had the dill pickle soup and a grilled cheese sandwich maybe the dill pickle soup was hyped too much or my expectations were really high but i just didn t care for it my husband had the beef stroganoff soup and the cuban and they were both fantastic i was completely envious we had the bearcat for dessert it s hot fudge over vanilla ice cream paired with hot caramel sauce over creamy butter pecan on a bed of fresh bananas and topped with our real home made whipped cream omg i don t think we even looked up until it was completely demolished my husband said it was the best sundae he s had in a very long time we were lucky to get a corner booth in the back so cute our waiter was great and the prices were crazy we had to look at the check a few times to make sure they charged us for everything we will absolutely be back
3703,the food was amazing the kani salad and crazy friday roll was my favorite even the basic california roll was delicious i can t wait to come back the servers were super friendly too
3704,i would give this place a higher rating except that it has a significant parking issue overall very well lit and management very responsive to repair issues and other issues parking is available for rent in a garage but if you were not wanting to rent a parking spot 70 80 dollars per month the other parking is very sparse after 5 pm not very ideal if you are a single woman working at night and having to come home late grounds are kept well and pest control is good
3705,mr b s has seen better days service is lacking we reordered bread and never received it wine was brought to the table well into the main course my soup was almost cold the food is still good but they really need to work on getting the service to the level it used to be
3706,awesome awesome awesome the fudgery in the riverside nola outlet next to the hilton nola riverside was a new treat for me personally when i went to look at the goodies that they had to offer i wanted a particular type of candy apple once again touching on my inner child to see what that story is about check out my review on the popcorn bistro what was a blessing and displayed an essence of true customer service was how the ladies kristeon joseph and simmeon bazile went the extra mile and create a candy apple created especially for me i was soooo elated my inner child was cheezzing that others wanted to see why i was so happy and was slowing down to take a peak as well i can t wait to taste the deliciousness of the candy apple i had carmel almonds with a drizzle of chocolate which was their special touch added i am at such a sugar rush with having had the beignets yesterday that i must pace myself ok nola now i need to go home and go back on my programmed eating because you fulfilled my inner child desires thanks and see you again soon
3707,this was my first time here my strawberry snow was delicious and the staff member that helped me was very nice it s a cute little spot to get a refreshing cold beverage and i ll definitely be back soon
3708,spent 3 days standing in long lines at multiple restaurants downtown for good yet very pricey food walked right in to el rey on saturday night food service were great very affordable check it out
3709,located in midtown this place has an awesome location their menu has so many rolls it s perfect if you re looking specifically for sushi their ingredients were extremely fresh as well to say the least i was very impressed with this sushi bar and will be back again next time i am visiting nashville
3710,the customer service and quality of nails here is impressive i called and made an appointment for 6 30pm at 6pm the women on the phone said no problem i show up and the place was packed but the women said i had an appointment and took me right away i was glad i made an appointment she was quick and my nails look great i got a no chip manicure place is clean and have a wide variety of colors to choose from
3711,amazing food but even better service by brit and everyone including the chef who made my daughter a special meal so she d eat and didn t charge us for that part of the order the of vegetarian choices were incredible seriously we had plantains cauliflower a corn on the cob a yucca fries corn empanadas a and cheese empanadas a must visit if you re in indie
3712,so it s our 5th visit two happy hour visits love the bar bites one birthday one valentines all good but tonight on a regular friday date night we were drawn in with a nice price fix email and we were very pleased exceptional service special thanks to phillip on lead and robert on the assist gracious accommodating and not the least perturbed by a promotional offer guest but wait there s more the lobster was sweet and delicious the filet perfectly cooked oh and the key lime pie delightful a lovely night with good value and a lasting sweet taste in the palate
3713,love this place i come 2 3 times a month for a 90 min massage with jim i don t get massages to relax i get them because if i don t i m in pain it s hard to find a therapist who is capable and skilled in a deep massage and can relax stubborn knots jim is your guy
3714,very attractive surroundings close to the harbor and downtown central area smallish menu we attended sunday brunch and both ate ramen chicken was rather bland and the broth was weak but the miso hamburger was very good at the end of the day 15 for a bowl of ramen is expensive so it better be pretty damn good and 1 2 is not good enough doubtful we will return
3715,amazing food staff members are extremely nice and good at explaining dishes you are unfamiliar with they also do trays for parties which is a lifesaver when you don t feel like cooking
3716,i absolutely love the wings here the sauces are delicious and i recommend the honey mustard and their buffalo fries both are winners i ve never once been disappointed from the food here
3717,very neat theme bar and grill the food is very tasty enjoyed lunch here and the service was very good gotta love how well the place is decorated not far from our house so we will likely be returning soon
3718,best tacos in tucson love going here they do a great job and have authentic food seating is tight and it can get a bit crowded but worth the wait
3719,we dined here upon recommendation from our hotel which is only two blocks from lascala we arrived shortly after 5pm and were seated promptly at a nice window seat my wife and i both ordered cocktails the trio meatball appetizer we shared a caesar she had the scallop risotto special and i had the chicken san remo overall an outstanding meal and service joey i recommend this establishment it does get busy so if you plan on arriving at the dinner hour make a reservation
3720,love this company i ve had to use their services twice in the last two months their technicians are always on time and very friendly and professional they work directly with your insurance company and i ve never had a problem
3721,fun little gelato shop lots of flavors to choose from and can sample flavors to choose your favorite they have a lot of great tasting flavors and have something for everyone i really enjoyed it
3722,the food is nothing short of spectacular everything and i do mean everything cause i ve had the whole menu is great the staff is super chill and very pleasant adequate parking available it is byo and the setting is small and intimate only reason i took star off is the pricing seems very high and there was just 1 tv without cable not good during a nba playoff game but otherwise the food makes up for the minor miscues
3723,we just moved to narberth and had our first meal at this neighborhood gem what a wonderful surprise this restaurant is quiet and unassuming when you enter it is busy warm and down to earth the service was excellent and the food a fantastic surprise i enjoyed the rosemary chicken and artichoke over bowtie pasta it was savory fresh and fragrant with herbs my dinner partners enjoyed their dishes too shrimp with andouille sausage grilled wild striped bass and a veal dish there were many homemade dessert options we tried a generous portioned chocolate mousse cake definitely recommend this place and will return to check out the weekend brunch menu
3724,neat and trendy little ice cream shop on whyte ave and the other side of the tracks went there during art walk and there was a bit of a line the lines moved pretty quickly though and soon we were at the front they had four flavors you could mix only certain combinations since they come out of a soft serve machine we ended up getting yam and coconut flavor swirl the cone cost 5 50 and the flavors were nice and not overly sweet which fit my personal preference it is definitely a bit on the pricey side but i think worth a try it s nice to see stores like this opening up along whyte ave,dream tea is one of the older bbt stores in edmonton certainly it was here before a lot of the bigger chains came to town the space has changed quite a bit over the years and so has their menu they serve bingsu like desserts as well as more traditional bubble tea the selection for bbt is wide from fruity mixtures to milk tea they have most of what you may ask for overall the quality is quite good and the prices are reasonable their mango shaved ice dessert is very tasty and one of my favorites i often order milk tea bbt without sugar and i have to say it s not the best at dream tea i actually find cha time has the best sugar free milk tea they also have a small selection of board games ultimately worth a visit
3725,my first visit to this brewery restaurant and i m close to being a fan we were here to celebrate a friend s birthday and it seemed like all 12 or so of us were satisfied with our food and experience it is a large and open space both dining room and bar area with some outside seating available as well if i were to revisit a good chance i will i d probably opt for bar area especially during happy hour since those specials are not offered in dining room trish made the reservation for our group and ran into one glitch the day of the event our 5 30 was changed to 5 00 by the restaurant this was supposedly to accommodate another party at 7 we were not rushed out when that time approached but we also saw no sign of another party i first perused the beer offerings there seemed to be at least 10 on draught and some earlier offerings in cans i selected their blueberry hefeweizen and enjoyed the crisp flavor on this warm night even though little to no berry taste came through i would probably try something else next time the food menu was possibly too large in my opinion with sandwich pizza apps and entrees offered i was very hungry and 75 of the menu appealed to me so i went to our excellent server frank for his advice he suggested a few dishes and i thought my beer choice would pair nicely with the pan roasted chicken entree it proved to be good advice a nicely cooked frenched breast with the skin crispified served with what seemed to be local asparagus and mashed potatoes the fowl was tender and juicy still the pan sauce was lightly citrusy and herbed it was good but could have been better if reduced and thickened the mashed were ok and probably the weakest link in the dish i had an add on caesar salad that was fair and overpriced as add ons go at 6 trish went with his advice and ordered a shrimp and scallops special she loved it and i have to admit they are sourcing quality crustaceans most others in our group ordered burgers and we heard many good things surprisingly no one else tried any beer we brought our own bday cake and were not charged a plating fee beer aficionados should consider joining their reward program for a 15 one time fee you are entitled to a special glass that holds 22 oz for the price of a pint along with other perks and incentives great place for gatherings let s go with 3 75 ongoing research yelps
3726,honestly this place is fire the drinks are incredible the julia rita and lobster tacos are a must we ordered the tacos ate them and ordered more the atmosphere is great from the white marble bartop to the swanky seating the wood beams were so aesthetically pleasing like all the staff also the dj for this thursday night was so nice and played my fave upon request ellie goulding they also have a happy hour worth coming to
3727,as other reviewers have mentioned came here for ansen after i found that he moved from another local salon to this new location haven t met anyone as meticulous friendly and consistent as him which is why i was his regular customer for over 4 years overall a very affordable men s haircut at 16 including wash scalp massage and blow dry still the same high quality service and cut as before so will be coming back soon
3728,stopped in for something sweet after a tour of vanderbilt it s very close we were greeted by friendly cheerful staff and felt right at home with the cozy interior we ordered bonuts and hummingbird cake to share the bonuts are fried dough balls with a lemon cream topping that rests on a warm blueberry compote the flavors and textures were incredible they say they are made with love and we definitely got the warm and fuzzies the hummingbird cake is a hundred percent southern comfort the frosting is so delicious i could eat it by itself the next time we are in nashville we will have lunch for sure
3729,amazing food and service i had the roasted chicken and potatoes yum moist chicken perfectly roasted potatoes our waiter was richie rich extremely knowledgeable attentive and entertaining he and ken our server made the experience all the more enjoyable our third trip to nola and our third visit to luke luke is what new orleans is about
3730,this is my absolute favorite bbq joint the staff is amazing and the specials are top notch,another great experience with hickory kitchen this time we had a them cater a birthday party the bbq got rave reviews and the corn bread was unbelievable i love this place and the staff
3731,i liked the atmosphere and the smoked pineapple martini i would most definitely recommend this place
3732,such a nice way to hang with girlfriends and catch up the staff are lovely and the atmosphere is cool the view of the river can t be beat definitely a worth while place to spend some time
3733,walked 4 5 miles on the trails at signal hill today first we stopped at signal hill and looked at the pictographs then we hiked cactus wren trail to the end and back for a 4 5 mike hike we even spotted a couple quail on the trail that was the plus side on the minus marking on the trails could be better putting the trails on the park maps would be another good idea also the roads to signal hill are dirt and not maintained very well there are many deep holes and most of the road has heavy washboard
3734,probably the best koa that we ve come across on the west shocked at how well this place is ran kept up all the things the price reflects it the spots are amazing and kept up very well super clean pools are very nice and made for entertaining the front is amazing staff is friendly and accommodating only amazing things to say about this place i can t imagine how hot it is in the summer but i m sure this koa does well
3735,i wanted to wait a few days to let the food settle to my backside before giving a thorough review to the masses and i must say it was a somewhat pleasant experience i had the regular gyro combo that came with chips and a drink everything about the actual gyro was pretty good and i ve actually been to greece and had a real gyro which was good too in comparison i give it 4 stars i left one off because i didn t have clear direction on if i should wait for my food to get done or wait at the counter and on top of that i was never called when it was ready yeah weird or maybe i was supposed to wait who knows but i ll be back
3736,my friend and i came in quick to do our nails we are visiting family from new york and new jersey where it can be pretty pricey with no pay off the ladies here did a great job and were very sweet to us i love how my nails turned out can t stop looking at them we will definitely come again whenever we are back in the area
3737,best taco salad on e tampa side of town i do enjoy the tacos and the guacamole of course please bypass taco bus if you are on this side while tb is delish taco sun is def better if you have the option
3738,i live in philly but i decided to go here after seeing a show at the media theatre with a friend i must say that everything that we ordered was amazing we ordered the fried mozzarella who knew that mozzarella cheese wrapped in a spring roll wrapper was sooo good as an appetizer she ordered the chicken marsala and i had the pasta in vodka sauce with added grilled chicken and creme brle cheesecake and coffee for dessert this was the best italian food i ve had in a while and we will surely be back
3739,this was my first time to this location and i couldn t have been more pleased without an appointment the friendly receptionist was able to book me in with stephanie she was simply awesome i d highly recommend her i m a runner so she was able to really target what i needed and gave me some stretches to do at home super thoughtful and caring
3740,greatest cicis i ve been to still covered in shame and self loathing when you leave but it was clean in there
3741,newly upgraded clean bright and welcoming have stayed and attended events here many times in the past recent upgrades and rebranding represent a high improvement
3742,hands down one of the best sno ball stands in metairie the person i went with described the ice perfectly velvety i do not think i have ever had more perfectly shaved ice no clumps lumps or chunks it tastes like what shaved ice is supposed to taste like i had the stuffed wedding cake sno ball with extra condensed milk their wedding cake flavoring is strong which i love they also give you extra condensed milk when you ask one of my biggest pet peeves is when i ask for extra condensed milk but there is nothing extra about it i m greedy with a beer belly i need this their nachos are also great the cheese is nice and thick it s not watered down i have been to stands where they have watered the cheese my only hang up is the fact that there is no wheelchair ramp it is 2018 people with certain disabilities should not have to sit in the sun because they can t use the steps that s a bit disappointing because this stand gets a lot of regular business please consider making it l accessible for people who use wheelchairs and other users in need of one the stand has a beautiful setup and nice shade but that shade is only available for walkers,ordered quite a few things bacon cheeseburger with fries oyster salad gumbo hot sausage sandwich and crab cakes the bacon cheeseburger was pretty good it was huge the flavor was what is expected of a burger and the meat was tender the fries however were similar to re warmed mcdonald s fries i definitely was not a fan of those the hot sausage poboy was excellent not too greasy fresh bread we had no complaints there i ordered the oyster salad for myself i was not pleased my biggest complaint is that i strongly believe that those were pre breaded oysters that restaurant stores sell in packs they simply did not taste fresh to me or salty like fresh oysters i did not touch the gumbo it was super thick like gravy i cannot say whether that was actually worthwhile finally the crab cakes were pretty good i enjoyed them they had a nice crab flavor and were cooked perfectly we opted out of the remoulade the employees are really kind the atmosphere is nice it is a large and open space with warm decor i want to give this place another try because there are so many other options to try i will update my review if necessary,first of all the soup du jour crawfish boil soup is phenomenal it s like a crawfish bisque chowder crossover it has small chunks of potatoes with crawfish tails i always get more than one to go i have also had their wednesday special which is white beans with fried catfish while they were not my mama s beans they were pretty good for a commercial establishment you might have to add a pinch of salt or zatarans the fish slices were pretty small but they were fried well with a seasoned taste finally i love their corn muffins they have tiny bits of jalapeo overall the latter meal was pretty good although i would expect bigger or more fish with the meal
3743,having stayed here several times it is my favorite hotel the staff is excellent really exceptional everyone from housekeeping to front desk staff to valets rooms are clean heating and ac are quiet beds are very comfortable and they make it feel special special k is awesome i cannot say enough about how wonderful and helpful he has been over all of our visits one of the best reasons to visit this hotel did i mention the exceptional staff turn down service is sucre chocolates on your pillow sweets for the sweet dreams the bathroom wasn t as slippery this time this was the first time we used the valet service and it worked great no more than a 10 minute wait for the car you can text them from your phone and they text back with how long it will take they also hosted a gold status reception we made a brief appearance on our way to a mardi gras ball our only glitch was a mini bar charge on our bill we didn t consume any of their food or drink and they happily removed it from the bill we will be back note to hotel please put louis back in the elevator
3744,if you re looking for something that will liquify the contents of your gut the super spicy dosa will do it i shared it with my father who took one bite and called it the most destructive thing he ever had it won t hit your taste buds hards but internally it s brutal the soup that comes on the side was okay but if you want to kick up the heat ask for indian green peppers to put into your dosa otherwise service is quick and noise is low the dosa will fill you up which definitely makes it worth the price and the drive can t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu
3745,we were in the mood for some malaysian food and stumbled upon penang we ordered the beef rendang and mango chicken they were meh just ok nothing special the beef rendang was so chewy and dry and the mango chicken looks pretty on plate but it was way too saucy and oily we couldn t finish it for that reason because we didn t want to end up reaching for bottles of water afterwards also there were def more mango slices than chicken was totally not worth the and def suggest to not order this
3746,austin martinez director of operations steven our server went above and beyond with our table awesome guys and great atmosphere made our friday night experience wonderful my friends and i will definitely be back to this great clayton spot
3747,good customer service great manager louder than most micjy d s good iced coffee like the app buy 1 get one for a penny
3748,this is a place we stop into every time we visit nola its become a great staple in all of our trips the food is filled with love and flavor you can tell the staff love what they do and really put their heart and soul into the food they have the best gumbo i ve ever tasted
3749,i am from the south and evidently the whole boiled hot dog thing is a northern thing i don t know what i was expecting but the boiled hot dogs threw me a bit the atmosphere is incredible and the people are so nice i got a corn dog and fries and i was not disappointed the boiled hot dog just takes some getting used to my kids wouldn t eat it because they re super picky but i well let s just say i love a good corndog
3750,great customer service when we checked in dylan was very helpful they noted the account to say it was my birthday and had a gift delivered to our room on the house how crazy is that they blew me away i ll definitely be back

3753,the best daquiri place we visited in new orleans very friendly staff and strong flavorful drinks
3754,this place is fantastic top notch couldn t find a thing to complain about if i tried we sat in the back yard garden it was like stepping into a mediterranean middle eastern garden we were actually supposed to head in for dinner but just couldn t leave the beauty of that garden drinks extremely unique we tried the poet but there were a bunch of awesome craft cocktails plus a full bar food delicious you don t get access to the full menu in the yard but the stuff that we did have access to was amazing service excellent bar waiter and support management really made us feel at home note we went without our kids changing tables and children friendly bathrooms were not assessed we ll see if there a deal breaker here
3755,when we travel we generally stay at a hotel that offers a clean bed and bath in a decent location we don t intend to center our visit around the sleep facilities on our first visit to st petersburg we reserved three nights at the hollander hotel because of its downtown location price and good reviews st petersburg is a nice walkable city with plenty of activities natural areas and gardens restaurants shops and entertainment however this is the first place i have wanted to return because of the hotel the hollander hotel opened in 1932 and has the ambiance of an old hotel you see in the movies in some ways it s like staying in an old movie the stairway has old movie posters on the walls it is meticulously kept and decorated there is a lobby a veranda and each floor has furnished common areas guests are relaxing and talking in each of these areas a pool with beautiful seating and a bar was added a few years ago adults are sitting around the pool enjoying drinks and music in little parties we have never experienced a more helpful and attentive staff we had trouble working our thermostat when we told the desk clerk about it he didn t say i ll call maintenance he said i ll come up and check on it and left a co worker in charge of the desk we experienced this kind of can do helpful attitude several times in our three days if that is not enough the hollander has a great casual restaurant bar dessert caf you can dine in or eat on the veranda the tap room menu has a nice variety with daily specials the prices are reasonable or inexpensive the food tastes great the service is good there s a good variety of beer and wines with a full bar we had breakfast there twice dinner once and late night dessert we hardly ever eat at a hotel restaurant but we would be happy to dine at the tap room anytime bottom line we enjoyed st petersburg but we will return to stay at the hollander hotel as with any place an incident for which the hotel is not responsible we were awakened by construction activity at 5 30 am one morning the city should have a noise ordinance against that not hollander s fault
3756,in town for work and stopped by for breakfast and wow awesome awesome space food service and everything about this place was great had the east nasty and
3757,this review is strictly for the tomato pie amazing i love it someone brought this to my niece s birthday party and i ve eaten almost a half of sheet to myself the sauce is sweet and the dough is simply great it is a shame that i don t live nearby or i d be ordering it often
3758,absolutely amazing must get the black garlic wings they are to die for my brisket ramen was delicious as well i can not wait to come back
3759,first off the friendly and helpful crew epitomized what customer service should be like the restaurant was clean and the food was outstanding and green chile a new mexican would be proud of well done blake s lovealota
3760,excellent food great ambiance raquel was our server and she made all the right recommendations soup to nuts an excellent dining experience
3761,an cajun restaurant with local flavors warm decor and friendly service by the harrah s hotel on the edge of the french quarter we were here for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by their reasonable pricing and fresh ingredients the oysters were great as were the beignets i didn t try the gamba but my friend loved it i tried the crawfish which was good but too salty everything was way too salty in my plate including the corn salt was allowed sadly to take over everything the amount of salt attacked my palettes rather than enliven them the whole dish was spicy which was fine it was the saltiness that s a problem service was efficient and very friendly which is a redeeming point a beautiful restaurant with just the right noise level
3762,5 of us gals had dinner here last night right before the boz scaggs concert at the capital the location is fab as it s right across the street there is ample city parking within a block area the front dining bar area is very cool looking pubby dark wood classy etc we had requested a table in the garden room which is totally different very high ceilings with numerous skylights plus big windows on the north side there are faux windows with shutters on the brick interior that give the feeling of a garden and there is a lovely fountain on one wall where we were seated we were greeted by rachquel sp is probably wrong who was delightful attentive unfortunately they were slammed due to the concert no doubt as this was a mon night they didn t have enough staff the bar was really behind as it took a good 10 15 mins to bring our drinks we ordered our food quickly i had the duck tacos they were just ok as the sauce was mediocre two friends had the mushroom ramen the taste was good but the mushrooms were under cooked the ramen was mushy the menu is quite eclectic varied but that s not always good as it takes a lot of effort to deliver a quality product it s hard to give an accurate picture when a restaurant is so slammed so i m giving them 4 stars for now will update if i return which will only be when i go to another concert btw rachquel comped our 1st round because we had to wait so long now that s the kind of customer service that brings people back give this place a try write a review
3763,a lovely evening at richard s celebrating our anniversary fine service excellent food and wine a wonderful evening
3764,ate my first donut from federal donuts loved it got the maple brown sugar one and an iced coffee everything was awesome the chicken smelled so good sad i couldn t try it was too full from the donut but i m not complaining
3765,came here just to grab a slice of pizza to go and i was so presently surprised growing up in new york has made me a pizza snob my boyfriend got pepperoni and i had a cheese slice both very excellent and satisfying the bartender who took our order was also very nice
3766,wonderful wonderful experience jim matt and the whole service team were not only professional but nice they took care of me during a very difficult time thanks again
3767,gena and the rest of the crew are extraordinary at their craft reasonable prices great products wonderful presence and no complaints true masters at hair and nails their the number one stylists in the area
3768,we were shoved in a tiny corner in the back room next to a huge party of pre teen girls i walked out with a huge migraine due the manager and waitresses inability to tell the children to stop screaming running around and playing in the fireplace this is not chuck e cheese food was ok nothing special had to send mine back specifically asked for no bacon and entree came covered had to ask twice for silverware and napkins
3769,this super target definitely lives up to its name it has everything under the sun you can think of that you might need and more the employees here are always so nice and super helpful my boyfriend and i are buying things we need for our new apartment and we got out of the store for under 200 for our entire kitchen and bathroom set up i love love love target s low prices and they do not have cheaply made things
3770,i came here for the first time last night for a beginners hip hop class i am not a dancer whatsoever but i have really been wanting to try hip hop our instructor sammy was awesome and kept the energy up the entire class i m shocked by the negative reviews on here because my first experience was very positive although i m a bit of a slow learner the dance that was taught wasn t rushed and i think if i were to attend a few more classes i would catch on much quicker overall i had a lot of fun and would recommend this studio to anyone who takes dance seriously wants to get a good bang for their buck
3771,this is a nice place to grab lunch i got the burger it was very good the pickled onions made it amazing and the rosemary fries are to die for it was very quiet when we went and that was nice
3772,this place isn t half bad as far as local bars go but the tourists kind of ruin it so make sure you get there at a descent time the roof top bar is really nice the staff is friendly overall not a bad spot if you re looking get some drinks and make friends with strangers,i have no words for this place your jaw will drop when you step inside when you see the selection of baked treats in front of you everything is fresh and there s plenty of parking i highly recommend this place and you can t beat the pricing either
3773,really good i got the east nasty princess yesss please the line was kind crazy but worth it every thing was fresh and hot,super cute ambiance weird that the bartender sitting drinking at the bar can t help you out and take a picture because it s not their policy to help u i asked everyone is so cool though and wanna get down on this dances floor
3774,piree s has become my family s go to we all love coming here the chicken is consistently hot and fresh and delicious as is all the food a great spot to come through

3776,it was a cold and chilly day today in march high 30s low 40s this guy not smart enough to have adapted to northeast weather totally was underdressed signed up for the chinatown walking food tour last minute and headed to the aia center across from the philadelphia convention center there waited jen in orange i ve posted a photo of what to look for at least for winter months our group was only 4 people today as the bigger group of 5 cancelled last minute no problems here this made the tour a lot more more intimate jen was extremely knowledgeable on the culture and reason philly chinatown came to be and in between her educational sessions we stopped at numerous places for food we got egg tarts at a pastry shop fish ball in a curry sauce spam masubi cambodian sausage boba tea along on stops and the final stop ended with a family style meal with our group members of soup dumplings mapo tofu snow pea leaves and fried tofu along the way she also pointed out other good places to eat and since i m a pretty new transplant i ll definitely be following up on her recommendations they also have other tours available and definitely thinking about hitting up the italian food tour once the weather gets warmer amazing 5 star experience
3777,i really loved the atmosphere of this salon i came in for a colour with madeena and a cut i think her name was keelie i hope i m getting it right and they were so lovely madeena asked me all the right questions about the colour and she kept asking me if my head was comfortable in the sink as she went to go tend to other clients and mix up my toner the only thing i m just a liiiiiittle picky over is the tone of my hair i think the lighting in the salon messed with me a little but i wanted it more like a vanilla tone and i find that it went pretty ashy which i m not mad about and i know the toner will fade madeena s work is definitely amazing and the colour blends beautifully i just wish it was a liiiiitle bit more of a vanilla and beige tone rather than super ashy keelie did a great job with the haircut and listened to all of my needs i would totally go back again
3778,we love this ruby tuesday s we only eat at the bar and have to say they caitlin victoria are two of the best bartenders around they are always attentive provide excellent service and and are fun to be around
3779,great food everything tasted very fresh was seasoned well ordered the greko salad a side of street fries delicious
3780,amazing food wait was long but so worth it the fish was great and the bbq even better if you are in the area try this place
3781,beautiful restaurant good drinks good food while the server did a great job the food came out haphazardly the highlight was the pork three ways the seafood pasta with cauliflower was okay the bread was amazing we had the black eyed peas with fried onion crisps as a side they were great the fried croquettes were decent definitely worth checking out
3782,really good selection of super cute bikinis plus good location lots of parking they also let me know if they didn t have my size they would order it for me 10 off and free shipping definitely will be back
3783,this is one of my favorite authentic chinese spots in chinatown let me tell you their salt baked squid is the bomb com and it s the best i ve ever had they also have a new sauce it s a dumpling sauce and it s more on the sweet side but adds great flavor to any of your meals they also added new items on their menu like scallion pancakes shrimp dumplings and crab rangoon they have wonderful customer service and the workers are exceptional they make your experience 10 times better you definitely will not regret checking this restaurant out
3784,if you ve got 6 to but awful hot sauces in a super market you have 8 to buy local handmade ones here holy smokes the dude inside is extremely chill they ll let you sample anything support small business and get your wing sandwich sauces here
3785,this is one of my favorite places in riverview food is good and customer service a bit expensive for the amount you get at least they don t sacrifice quality
3786,good indian food at fair prices i ordered take out for father s day the ekta naan and the paneer naan were excellent the garlic naan was a little dry the frozen garlic naan i get from trader joes and throw on the charcoal grill is actually a little better if i heat it just right anyway the saag aur paneer was creamy and delicately seasoned it could not have been any better the basmati rice that came with it was light and fluffy my wife s vegetable biryani was more like uzbek pilaf than biryani it definitely could have been lighter with more separation between the grains but it tasted really good and the portion was so big that it gave us lunch the next day we definitely will come back eat lots of ekta naan and paneer naan and try something new
3787,blink and you might miss this place and you definitely don t want to do that i received a coupon flyer in the mail and decided to give this place a shot and i am so glad i did i placed an order for carryout online and it was ready at the exact time it was promised i was greeted with a smile eagerness to help and all around friendly staff the food itself is great the deal i took advantage of was 2 medium 2 topping pizza s for 6 99 each and a 3 00 cheesy bread special pepperoni black olive and pepperoni meatball i ordered mine light baked and they were perfect super soft crust but still with a crunch will absolutely be back i may have found a new pizza spot

3789,ok i d been dreaming of this place and my experience turned out kinda blah our order was messed up added some of my sides to my cousins bag of food then told me basically i had to get mine out of hers since they accidentally gave her my extras leaving me with the type of sauce she ordered on my potatoes and corn not a big deal but i wanted what i wanted my food came 15 mins after hers i did enjoy my dish and would have been pleased if it was how i wanted it but unfortunately it wasn t the sauce on my cousins food kinda looked like mud so for presentation it was a no also what s pictured is my cousins meal because it looked much better than my little bag
3790,the food was great desserts amazing and service exceptional cash only but very reasonable
3791,i went to this darling little place today for lunch oh my gosh the best stuffed cabbage rolls i have ever had everything is made from scratch i ordered the walnut cake to take home let me tell you an experience to die for this walnut cake was way over the top it is like being in a european kitchen you can bring your own wine amazing i got a big hug before i left
3792,this is my go to italian restaurant next time i m in this area fresh ingredients cooked clean they ll get you a bottle of wine if you forget it s byob
3793,went for our valentines dinner tonight and the staff and manager went out of their way to make this night so special highly recommend this location
3794,down the street from our airbnb in treme i only ran in for coffee but they had a great patio that i would have loved to hand out on for a bit if i had time
3795,we have been there twice there is usually only one other customer or couple there the staff is friendly and polite but the food is about as good as you would get in the frozen section of your grocer and more expensive no thanks
3796,we came in on a sunday evening jordan was our server she did an excellent job was knowledgeable friendly and accommodating to our dietary preferences the food was amazing and the entire staff could not have been nicer this is my favorite restaurant downtown
3797,this is our go to wing place been there 100 times and never had food that disappointed always fresh crispy saucy piping hot delicious wings and sides try the onion rings too don t let the divey style of the place deter you it s just super casual they aren t focused on the building they are all about thier food and service
3798,i know there are so many fancy local places to get a good burger and i m cool with all that but my favorite burger in the city is still at five guys i get my junior cheeseburger all the way and share a medium fry with my husband and feel like i ve eaten enough food for days love the flavor love the casual atmosphere and love having such a basic non boring amazing burger sometimes simple is the way to go,i m so glad we have this macy s location it is easy to access with parking right in front so i can go to a mall store without actually having to drive to castleton this store is usually pretty clean and quiet i m honestly unsure how it stays open all the time so it makes for a pleasant shopping experience they don t have quite as large of a selection as the castleton location but i can usually find what i am looking for it can be difficult to find a staff member when trying to check out but overall i am thankful for this store and will continue to come back,got my nose pierced here and recently went again with my sister when she got a tattoo the business is very clean and organized the staff can be a bit gruff but i m wondering if that s part of the i m a cool tattoo artist vibe i definitely felt i received good information about the care and keeping of my piercing and they were very helpful when i called a week later with a question they have a nice selection of jewelry options and pricing is affordable i would definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting a tattoo or piercing
3799,good food family ok kids love it chicken buffalo pastrami recommended take your time at lunch need 30 to 40 min
3800,the atmosphere was charming and relaxed service by eliz was incredible she was attentive accommodating and quick to serve she gave us updates and was fully knowledgeable about the dishes the flavors were savory balanced and well developed the portions were so filling we took home doggie bags
3801,thank you ett gud barkery my daughter s cake came out amazing i brought a picture that i saw on a social media site of a cake that i wanted for my daughter s 21st birthday when i picked up my cake it was even better then i expected i will be using them in the future and also recommending them to friends
3802,awesome staff good vibe they all work hard and at a fast place i can t complain and its pet friendly
3803,first time placing a pickup order overall good salad could be a little more fresh parmesan garlic wings were very good and i m picky about parmesan garlic wings just moved a few miles from where i use to be this was closer for us but sadly no delivery maybe with time other barro s offer delivery
3804,last night had another excellent meal accompanied by a fine microbrew beer a great place to share small plates and sample a wide selection of draft and bottled beers nice that they have vegetarian and carnivore sides to their menu too
3805,what is not to love about sherbrooke liquor store seriously the best selection of beer in town as well as a pretty awesome selection of spirits as well the liquor store location is anything but ideal the surrounding shops are a bit suspect and the area isn t one of the better ones in the city this is where my complaining is going to stop once you walk into the doors the staff are usually very good about greeting you the sliding door to the beer cooler is immediately on the right bring your warm coat it s cold in the cooler the cooler is chock a block full of beer some wine and sake the space between the shelving is very narrow and usually there isn t enough room to even get past someone else the shelves are floor to over 6 ft and full of various beers they have done a pretty good job of grouping the different beers ie local seasonal pilsners fruit flavour etc there are a few tags on the various beers in each section that highlight staff picks and hidden gems which is always welcome as you get to try something that someone else thinks is a winner the remainder of the liquor store the heated part isn t as crammed as the beer cooler but still offers up a fairly big selection of different spirits and wines overall sherbrooke is going for uniqueness and not quantity the beer selection is by far the best in the city they also have a very nice selection of wines and spirits some of the spirits can be had for less if you are going for the more common ones the ones that can be found elsewhere i ve had several conversations with different staff and they are all very helpful and will help guide you if you need assistance this is my go to for beer
3806,michelle did a great job with my cleaning gentle and precise dr amy creech is consistently awesome i ve been a patient for 20 years she s educated in natural options products as well as standard conventional dental care no one likes getting dental work done receiving bad news about teeth or gums or getting the bill dr creech patiently takes the time to educate you plus answer all questions and understand your concerns rachel is my favorite dental assistant she s friendly empathetic and a great conversationalist which is so helpful for the not so fun appointments jeannine the operations manager skillfully navigated the drudgery of the financial side plus she s a wealth of knowledge and info since she s a hygienist the collective skill communication sensitivity and compassion from all these women keeps me coming back they re an exceptional team
3807,food and service was great try the blt and the egg rolls the drinks are so good as well
3808,hospitality was great food was ok i ordered the fettuccine alfredo it wasn t good i don t know what it was about it but but sauce was just gross i don t know how you mess up alfredo sauce but it wasn t good the pizza rolls were great and i loved them but the alfredo just wasn t good good service though
3809,dinner was pretty good fish was cooked perfectly charbroiled oysters could have been cooked longer shrimp and crab pasta was good burger wasn t good flavorless and over cooked but our server devin was outstanding felt like he was part of our group
3810,impeccable service have read the other reviews here and this was definitely not my experience with bluepoint i was matched to them via my home warranty company for a pump motor issue they came out as soon as they could had the repair authorized and the motor changed all inside of about 4 work days which considering having to go through the warranty company is pretty good throughout the project bluepoint remained in constant communication with me providing updates on arrival status and completion had a very professional experience with each person i spoke with and the tech that actually replaced the pump i d do business with bluepoint in the future
3811,great food and a small town feel angie is one of the sweetest people and makes you feel so very welcomed
3812,i have been going here for years one of my favorite places to eat thai i ve never had a bad experience and their tables are amazing to look at
3813,awesome burgers calamari steak sandwich is on point as is the friendly service and comfortable atmosphere a lifelong resident of sb and this was my first visit here will definitely come back again
3814,we came here for lunch and ordered a caesar side salad and a small zen garden salad they were both absolutely delicious we also ordered the puttanesca and the meat me in st louie both were amazing it is a very comfortable atmosphere great craft beer selection and they have happy hour between 3 pm and 6 pm with three dollar cans
3815,super solid choice any day of the week my favorite thing about twisted tail is that it s always a good choice whether you ve got some foodie friends in town and want to impress but not quite looking for vetri level shenanigans or just looking to catch a great happy hour deal twisted tail should be your go to place i ve enjoyed their lovely dinner menu and service but more often you ll find me at the bar enjoying live music and munching on yummy social hour bar bites get the crawfish mac n cheese and oysters and drinking super reasonably priced cocktails and 3 beers they also give you complimentary savory popcorn at the bar they have social hour seven days a week and a nice lounge on the 2nd floor if you re really feeling mellow just do it
3816,really great vibe in this place their setup is really good with a bat inside patio outside and revolving food trucks i asked about expansion and they advised that they are presently scoping out several local areas
3817,came by this place after successfully completing an escape room and it definitely satisfies that carb craving on a cold day the entrance is located down an alley which is never appealing but nothing ventured nothing gained the cheesy garlic bread was on point and their ranch was spot on the bbq chicken was the crowning moment for me for one extra dollar you can add smoked ghost pepper jack cheese and let me tell you it is 100 worth it also clean bathroom always a plus,if you re looking for good meat and cheap food you ll find it here the tortilla i was dealing with on my tacos wasn t amazing but the carne asada al pastor and lengua are on point i especially was vibing with the lengua large chunks and seasoned amazingly oh their service is good too quick friendly
3818,first time here came here because i was across town from my usual taco place modest looking exterior hides a gem within clean very friendly service good portion size oh yeah the tacos were fantastic had a couple with fried grouper and a couple with carnitas bare and extreme style extreme was good but the extra toppings hid the excellent flavor so i d recommend the plainer version and the jalapeo sauce spicy but flavorful i m looking forward to round two
3819,today was my first visit and can i just say wow soooo good i had the pad thai and can t wait to try the rest of the menu this is hands down the best food to be had on the east side
3820,we have eaten many times since it opened and it just gets better and better the food is delicious but we have many places to eat in reno that serve delicious food i want to give a shout out to the owner manager who comes to the table and welcomes you and finds delight in you being a customer he is pleased you are back the servers are excellent and do everything possible to make your experience a happy one you can bet we will return
3821,this is a classic is school steak house experience the prime rib is particularly delicious and enormous been around for a long time and it feels like it in a good way big steaks stiff drinks low pretense what s not to love
3822,i have been a patient with dr eberle now for close to a year i find the dr to be straight forward and honest about any questions and procedures are required i am a person who really hates going to the dentist but he and his staff have been most accommodating in relieving tensions for me his front desk staff members are polite and knowledgeable his office has given me a new outlook for future work that will need to be done
3823,i wish i could give this place more stars and i wish i d be staying in new orleans long enough to go back we were in a lyft listening to the radio and one of the dj s said she went there over the weekend and the other dj was saying how he just loves it there after looking it up we learned it was also on ddd so we decided we had to give it a try and we were not disappointed i m a huge fan of the iberville tea that may be my new favorite adult beverage the boudreaux pizza is so ridiculously good so happy i have leftovers i can t wait to finish them the atmosphere is really cute and our server was awesome i totally get why the dj s speak so highly of it
3824,if you re looking for a restaurant with ample options hollywood grill has got you covered from all day breakfast options to sandwiches burgers pasta seafood meat entrees and dessert there s something for everyone on the menu however with a large selection quantity comes limited quality i ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and had to pull out almost all of my chicken because it looked and tasted suspicious my sister ordered the french dip and found the meat to be really dry one item i did like was the chili the bowl portion is served in a ceramic platter and is almost large enough to be a full meal the price range for sandwiches is around 9 13 while the entrees are closer to 15 and seafood is over 20 i can t imagine their seafood being fresh though so the price seems a bit high the restaurant opens at 6 am each day so i feel as if it s better as a casual breakfast spot than one i would go to for lunch or dinner
3825,we ve gone to several different vets at kirkwood animal hospital over the years and you honestly can t go wrong we currently see dr hormuth and couldn t give a more glowing recommendation she loves our dog and he loves her to put it in to perspective my dog cooper legitimately gets excited if i say we re going to the vet
3826,just had a great experience we all had the 3 for 10 meal the baked potato soup southwest soup bacon cheeseburger sirloin steak w mashed potatoes all of it was impressive for the price we paid our drinks were on the table before the waiter was done taking our order service today was outstanding no room for dessert we all agreed that we want to come back bring friends so they can have a good time with good food good peeps
3827,decided to patronize this restaurant chose to sit at the bar because it was quicker to sit down bad idea the bartender didn t properly greet us took awhile to ask if we wanted drinks asked for water with lemon got no lemon not big deal figured i would ask if we can order a appetizer at the same time felt like he looked at us with an annoyed look it took so long for lettuce with chicken mixture i had to get up and look for manager the manager graciously brought the appetizer and gave it to us for free i had to tell him that we never even got to put in our dinner order he took our order but it still took very long to get the meal an hour after we sat down when we did question the bartender about the appetizer my boyfriend was very nice to ask when we could expect it and he gave us an attitude my man i just put it in it still cooking lettuce and diced chicken smh meanwhile the two people that sat down before us were only waiting for one salad it took 40 minutes for their salad that came out wrong i will say the manager was nice and professional that bartender treated us like we were an annoyance i guess because we weren t going to sit there and get drunk not sure but his customer service sucked
3828,great pizza we had the diavolo and arugula and prosciutto both were excellent friendly wait staff great casual addition to the neighborhood
3829,the drive thru service is trying my patience if it s not someone dragging out their greeting a little too much wasting what little of my lunch break i have it s someone rushing me when i place my order today in particular i asked for a med 4 for 4 combo she asked the drink i tell her and she then just asks if i want anything i haven t even told her what sandwich i wanted i tried to ask for the sandwich but she goes yeah yeah i got it anything else how rude can you possibly be the service should be quick but the customer shouldn t be rushed especially when not asked the complete questions for the order i paid i got my food but it wasn t how i tried to ask for it since the lady at the window rushed me not even a bloody smile i rushed back inside told them what happened and they give me my new sandwich without even a bloody apology far be it for me to tell someone how to do their job but i used to work for a drive thru and even on my amateur days would i have worked circles around that worker do better and be more thorough with taking orders no matter if it s lunch rush or not
3830,my friends and i are staying across the cafe for spring break and we were so excited about this cafe we decided to swing over there around 9 30am and let me tell you they did not disappoint i was so impressed with the politeness of the staff and the quality of the food we both ordered the avocado toast and mimosas the eggs on the toast were delectable and the avocado was at a perfect level of ripeness the mimosas were great as well the orange juice had a little pulp in it which i surprisingly found enjoyable overall we had a great experience here and we plan on visiting a few more times before we leave this weekend
3831,had an amazing dinner thanks to our waiter josh loved the baked cheese broccoli toubouleh and octopus the desserts he recommended were amazing sundae and burnt cream josh also recommended great wine to pair with our meal
3832,kidtopia is the perfect place to bring your kids my daughter had a blast at a recent birthday party there kidtopia is clean which is a huge deal and hand sanitizer is available throughout the facility the owners are professional welcoming and friendly the location is awesome we are looking forward to heading back to kidtopia soon
3833,if you know me you know i hate shopping however you have to go to the store and buy things to eat to wear to feed your animals to live you have to buy things so out of convenience and now more than ever since sam s closed i spend a little more time here i recently got their cc so i can save 5 on every purchase often i find some of their grocery items are cheaper than anywhere else they offer sales and coupons and 5 off or on a gc if you buy a certain amount of a certain type of item not hard to do savings here can be found and i can appreciate that the stock in this store is pretty good the customer service is very good 2 seconds before hurricane irma on my way out of town the manager allowed me to break open a multi pack of different flavored cat foods because one of my cats who was going through a phase would only eat one flavor and they only had it in this multi pack because the other flavors in the pack were sold at that store individually as well they could put those on the shelf to sell it was very nice of them to allow me to do that the store has been there quite a while it s always clean the only thing that s changed is their 1 3 stuff isn t great anymore i used to be able to buy kids prizes there like 50 of them at a time and now can t find anything for 1 nor anything worth the 3 i guess that goodness is gone but that s ok the rest of the store is still a great store
3834,i almost don t want to give away this secret so i can always get a table this place came highly recommended and we couldn t have picked a better spot for our date night small and cozy and the food was amazing as recommended we split the steak made for the table totally worth the price i ve been to a lot of nice steak houses in the city and this steak beat them all we ended with the apple fritter dessert not something i would normally order but again recommended omg as good as the steak hubby said this was his top experience eating out ever i agree it was in my top three i had an amazing experience at the vetri flagship restaurant in philadelphia and i had a burrata experience to die for in center city i love that this is byob as well you can bring a wine that match the greatness of the steak and not have to pay double the price of the bottle lastly our server was friendly and knowledgeable and happily helped us chose our appetizers we can t wait to go back
3835,o sole mio is a great addition to the neighborhood we were welcomed by the friendliest owner who accommodated us with high chairs for the kids and cold waters on the hot day not a ton of seating options but it worked perfectly for us to park our stroller right next to the outdoor tables they also brought us a basket of bread just to help keep our kids occupied we ordered the caprese salad buffalo margarita pizza and the pesto pizza they were so good and imo better than some of the trendier options close by i am rooting for this place to do well bc we will definitely be back
3836,wow flavor city bring your mom bring your so bring your kid this whole experience was wonderful first of all upon arrival we were greeted by the host she was so friendly and explained everything to us as we were first time diners this place is a casual dining experience you order at the counter food is served to you and cleaned up for you once you finish eating on a scale of one to ten the service was chick fil a we ordered 1 4 mild chicken breast with sweet potato fries piri piri 1 4 hot chicken leg with basmati rice 5 mango lime wings all chicken has your option of seven different sauces but not to worry if you a greedy indecisive jawn like me all the sauces are available to you next to the soda fountain my personal fave mango lime hot this the perfect mix of sweet and spicy the side orders also came with a white sauce yogurt mayo based sauce this also aided in cooling the mouth from heat chicken was so juicy and flavorful perfectly cooked not frozen only thing is the chicken breast didn t have any skin on it tho not sure why but next time i would ask for them not to take it off the sweet potatoes fries were magical the piri powder on top was a perfect touch it s the flavor you didn t know you were missing i would not opt for the basmati rice again tho i thought it was gonna be like java rice which pairs more nicely with this type of chicken but it wasn t my mistake overall this the closest thing to nando s in the area would 10 10 recommend
3837,one of my favorite pizza restaurants in town great service and great flavor if you like gluten free crust one of the best
3838,great staff very accommodating they will walk you around to assist you finding what you are looking for definitely one stop shop
3839,i just received a valentines bouquet they are the prettiest flowers i have ever received the flowers are gorgeous
3840,simply the best a reason to get up in the morning i don t even know what to eat when this place is closed
3841,first time at this little gem the ticket prices were reasonable and we saw a great show american made is a talented group a full two hours loved the blue brothers music after intermission well worth the drive from orlando,my husband and i usually stay at the hollander when attending a rays game love their shuttle service we were attending a concert at the palladium and saw it was within walking distance the front desk staff are great so friendly we had dinner in their restaurant before the show the fish was perfectly prepared and who doesn t love mashed potatoes with their entre we headed downstairs for breakfast after checking the menu in our room veggie omelet was perfect and they offered us a to go cup for our coffee we ll be back
3842,stopped in while in area for a slice ed was extremely accommodating by cooking a fresh supreme for me it was delicious cooked perfectly and even the crust was completely cooked he even added extra sauce inside the box and that was great for dipping the last bites of the crust thanks man i ll be back
3843,this is my favorite restaurant for african food although the restaurant is small the entire staff are extremely friendly and attentive and it helps that the food is delicious i have tried just about everything but my favorites are the dibi lamb yasa fish and potato greens be sure to taste the fresh brewed tea full of herbs the owner makes
3844,i love this place i miss the old owner sherry but rebecca new owner is super sweet and helpful and she chit chats with you instead of just hurrying you in and out which is rare these days she was a bit late opening up today but that s ok as i know things happen sometimes and i have been late to work myself sometimes still very kitschy and cute place and packed with lots of goodies just waiting to be discovered def a great place to check out and reminisce of days gone by
3845,great spot for coffee and hearty breakfast cozy and close to the conference center service was great coffee was great
3846,really enjoyed our four night stay at this beautiful hotel beautifully decorated modern clean and very friendly and attentive staff bed was extremely comfortable and the room was super quiet bar with outdoor seating was very enjoyable and the cocktails were excellent highly recommend
3847,it was a pleasant surprise walking into this restaurant from the customer service to the food if you re ever staying at the hampton inns and looking for great tasting mexican food at walking distance check out el pollo rico i ordered 1 4 of chicken plate and my boyfriend ordered the 1 4 combo chicken with tri tip we left with happy belly s the salsa bar also carries a variety of authentic salsas from mild to hot enjoy
3848,my sister had been wanting to do archery for a while so i grabbed a random groupon to try this out turned out to be a ton of fun and it wasn t super busy on a tuesday evening so we both got to simultaneously shoot the owner i am assuming has an absolutely insane sense of humor it seemed the people who were already there are regulars and extremely helpful in keeping me from breaking the rules and killing myself truly a fun place to be and a great experience not a bad way to spend an evening 11 10 will recommend
3849,surprisingly good wine list food was good our server steve was excellent and had great recommendations for the table don t miss the smoke salmon spread would have licked the bowl if i was not concerned about public perception my colleague orders the tuna and was not disappointed i had the shrimp and grits grits were very buttery shrimp and andouille sausage were excellent on top the fish tanks and walk thru are not to be missed only thing i would add are years to the wines listed i did need to ask about the grigich chardonnay we ordered it was a 2014 delicious
3850,i started going there after being charged and insane amount at another place in tucson for a full set the prices are extremely reasonable and i love them every single time the customer service is outstanding as well the lash tech i see is joy she is amazing i have sensitive skin and my eyes get irritated easily and whenever she put the eye pads on she asks if its bothering me or if she needs to adjust anything she also goes over the length and type of lash i want before she starts i don t really know the terms for everything but i personally like a natural look but just making my lashes look fuller and she does it every time just explain what you re looking for and you ll get it if you need a new reliable lash place this is the place to go
3851,just had dinner here beautiful decor food was very good service was excellent the rest is very very clean will def be back

3855,wow awesome place this is my first yelp review because this place is so great being hispanic i am really impressed with the quality and authenticity of the food at lima fusion i would definitely return to eat here again
3856,some friends had recommended this place for breakfast so my friends and i decided to come i m so glad i did hands down best shrimp and grits i ve ever had one of my friends ordered the bananas foster french toast and that was fabulous i ll get that next time then another friend got the crab meat omelette and it was such a good flavor everything i tried was very good and i definitely recommend this place it s in a shotgun style building so seating is limited so there usually is a wait but it s not bad and totally worth the wait i promise
3857,came here for lunch on a very cold day convenient location right around the corner from my office a had a few co workers tag along so we ordered to go it s nice they have two options for ordering a self serve kiosk as well as though a cashier we all opted for the kiosk really interesting the deluxe pho is the same price as all of the others i found this as a bonus because i prefer multiple goodies over choosing only one protein service was quick but we found ourselves waiting around for those who ordered bahn mi sandwiches when we got back to the office everything was packaged great no spills etc i liked that they give you all the sprouts noodles basil etc in a separate bowl however you ll find at the bottom of that bowl is a tiny plastic cup of hoisin not sure why they decide to hide it at the bottom but some of my overeager coworkers poured their broth in before fishing it out i was really happy with the pho i thought it was super flavorful and i will definitely be back soon
3858,have you ever had shave ice from hawaii did you think this is the best thing i ve ever had wrong the shave ice at this place is so much more delicious they put ice cream on the bottom and the ice is shaved up so finely it is the perfect mix together the syrups are so tasty and all natural which i appreciate tired of all this fake sugary stuff you can get toppings on them too which makes it even better very nice twist on shave ice it is far from a snow cone btw cant wait to have another
3859,the food was pretty good the atmosphere was great for me it would make much more sense to do dinner there for lunch there is really nothing to drink if you don t want alcohol they have mexican made sodas the crispy avocado fried rice was good but make sure you put meat in it if you order the fries were no good the israeli hummus was good with the lamb added
3860,steak shawarma in a bowl with rice base absolutely delicious the pita bread is so soft and fresh the only regret is that i finished everything in my bowl and was stuffed also it was a bit salty i did not feel it when i ate it but was kind of thirsty afterwards
3861,while it may not be saying much this is the best ramen in tucson it s workers food through and through no true ramen is high class and this place simulates the blue collar restaurant experience well the food is all good and one should always get extra chashu pork no matter what ramen you order service is fast and to the point and i cannot blame the servers for being tired as this place is always packed
3862,mere words are not enough to express the delight and flavors this diner cafe gives off from the moment you hit the front door and sample the bottomless drip to the second your seated before your meal it s homey and the staff inviting will definitely return and that s huge praise from my new yorker trained palate let the grubbing begin
3863,we were all incredibly impressed by the menu the food was delicious the menu is flexible enough for anyone the staff was spectacular and made it a memorable meal thanks to them for being so welcoming i loved starting the meal with a shot of olive oil truly impressive restaurant
3864,wow it s wonderful to find a restaurant with a hometown feel these folks at chill go out of their way to make your dining experience perfect we feel like we made new friends the food was delicious they couldn t do enough for us to make sure that we were happy with our meal and had everything that we needed the atmosphere is great and the entertainment was fabulous can t wait to go back
3865,my husband had the 6 oz pepperloin meal and was very happy with it i had the shrimp kabob meal there were only 4 shrimp and they were more then well done and very small the service was good the restaurant was not busy
3866,i just ordered a burger from plum bistro via uber eats i just wanted to let everyone know that the burger was phenomenal i never post on yelp the burger was so good that it inspired me to type i will definitely be ordering again thanks plum bistro
3867,great selection of beers i sometimes don t know how to chose food is tasty sort of like an upscale version of finger bar food atmosphere is great especially when caiden brewer performs live music on the patio wish they would make the patio smoke free
3868,just order from here today the food is great i haven t had sushi in a long time the california rolls and the crabragoon is so good i would order here again
3869,love the atmosphere and also the food drinks were great bartenders were friendly and recommended drinks for you
3870,this place is amazing i was so surprised and in awe that places like this exist it s free to enter and you can pay to park close by or park for free at the mall and walk over from there there are small shops and spots to grab a bite and several different garden areas to explore i love being outside and seeing sights without the elements of being outside so this was a perfect spot for me to visit
3871,my friend and i came here wanting to explore a new coffee shop we were pleasantly surprised the cafe was busy with almpat no seats available we were able to snag a couple of seats while we waited for our maple lattes the coffee was great it wasn t too sweet and the granola was awesome i will say that the parking is ok it s defintely easier than tampa but can be hard to find on the weekend there is also street parking that doesn t require you to parallel park
3872,the eggs benny were slamming and the state st salad was supper will be going back again
3873,has to be the best bbq around food us always the same great been doing here for years and never fails to be awesome give this place a chance and you won t be disappointed

3877,got the massage package which included mani pedi and blowout great price for all those services my hair is thick so they ended up charging extra for that so just be aware the massage was fantastic ask for tara if you go
3878,we took my daughter s suv to killa dent removal this past weekend to have a few small dents and a larger dent paint transfer removed we didn t have time to get this taken care of before leaving california but i am so happy that we found a great dent removal repair shop close to our home here to have the work done scheduling an appointment was seamless we waited about an hour and sid removed all of the dents and had her suv looking brand new again he was honest professional and provided excellent customer service it can be a little cumbersome trying to find a reliable repair shop to take your vehicle to when needing to get work done being from out of state this was the best experience thus far while settling into indy i would highly recommend killa dent removal if you need to have any work done additionally sid is also a veteran frequenting veteran owned businesses is a great way to show support for returning service members and their families having several members of our family serve it was a privilege to patronize his repair shop thank you sid
3879,decent korean barbeque but subpar cold buckwheat noodles to go with it couple notches below what you can get in atlanta
3880,cool place with lots of plants and pots great choice of mexican pots and statues exc there us a wide variety of fruiting plants and trees look for the wild parrots in the power line transformers nice people good service will go back would recommend
3881,this spa was a wonderful experience i spent the afternoon here with my daughter and her girlfriend the service was fabulous everyone was very kind and attentive to us i had a facial and body treatment i came out completely relaxed with my skin glowing the girls had therapeutic massages and both said their masseuse was focused and paid attention to key areas overall excellent experience i ve just moved to the area so i will now be using the spa on a regular basis
3882,looks from the street like it would be good but it was just okay our waitress pretty much forgot about us the entire time we were there not sure what that was all about we tried practicing mindfulness to make the time pass while we were waiting for her to come back out and take our order my nachos were disappointing basically felt like a slice of cheese was melted over chips with globs of black beans the kale salad was a warm mound of wilted kale mixed with parm cheese my son liked his burger so that was good
3883,delicious small plates and vegetarian friendly went twice in one weekend pita bread is insanely delicious as are shishito peppers and stuffed grape leaves
3884,so this restaurant is in a colorful area of town full of lovely ethnic restaurants first thing love that they have their own parking lot on a chilly day it is nice to park close the food is delicious tasty fresh dumplings that can be boiled steamed or pan fried with a variety of fillings they did not have the lamb with dill so we ordered chicken with curry dumplings lamb with coriander and beef with tomatoes as well as the fresh noodles splashed with chili oil all were delicious however the lamb with coriander were our favourite huge portions delicious fresh and flavourful and a very kind server however it was slightly run down on the inside and both of us found it very cold inside two things that could use some improvement but for the price quality and quantity of food we will definitely be back to try other flavours they also have a take out pick up option which would take care of the atmosphere try it i don t think you will be disappointed
3885,excellent place if you are in the nashville area please check out edley s food was just awesome hot chicken was the best nice environment and friendly staff
3886,we had reservations and were seated in a corner window spot which gave great views of tampa bay the selection was less than expected while the buffet was served in a grand room it looked more than offered especially for the price service was phenomenal with equally good quality which pretty much made up for the lack of selection the blackened ahi tuna was outstanding and our server was very attentive loved the option to order small plates in addition to the buffet
3887,we found this place from a local can i just say yay man get on in there the jerk chicken the brown sugar chicken the curry chicken were amazing andre is the best the ambience is amazing and comfortable andre s wife is a rockstar chief from jamaica the food is super authentic 5 stars
3888,pretty good food food price they have lunch specials that are awesome for dinning in i always order a boba tea while here i ordered spicy broccoli chicken small egg drop soup a thai tea and crab puffs to go included with my broccoli chicken was white rice i paid 20
3889,we have been looking for a new groomer for a few months now it seems every mobile groomer that we ve used in the past has not been consistent or ditched for the follow up appointments so i called various groomers in the area and the ones that actually called me back were either ridiculously expensive or didn t do dogs her size i recently came across preen pet grooming and scheduled our great pyrenees an appointment she came for the first time this morning we are so satisfied with the grooming that she gave our dog also the prices were very reasonable the owner kay was so professional and knowledgeable from start to finish our pyrenees came out and looked like a brand new pup she was so clean soft and fluffy kay understood her breed and what she needed we scheduled her another appointment in 6 weeks and will continue to use preen pet grooming so happy to have finally found such a great mobile groomer thanks kay

3893,local beers on tap stiff and delicious bloodies and homemade deviled eggs topped with crispy bacon and baked capers what s not to love the bartender is a doll and was here when we visited nola a year ago this is a great stop to come in cool off and rehydrate with some tasty libations after strolling the french market its right across the street cool spot in a cool town,unexpectedly wonderful i had walked by this place on our last trip to new orleans during a daytime stroll and it looked pretty touristy my husband heard from a local that it was a must do so this year we booked our final dinner here it did not disappoint service was attentive and impeccable and the food was well paced and beautifully prepared the gumbo was the best we had on our food centric trip so tasty and well seasoned and served hot a must for me we also really enjoyed the duck and the bread pudding was out of this world and i am not a dessert person be sure and explore the property including the haunted table and beautiful upstairs it is a lovely building with cozy beautiful rooms making it an intimate setting even though it is so large recommend muriel s to visitors and local alike

3896,simply amazing i loved this place so much i had the carne asada tacos with refried beans yellow rice and a side of guac i even had a churro for dessert i did try the watermelon cucumber drink but i didn t really care for it too much i thought it was a little too sweet but i m not a juice drinker i just wanted to try something new but as for the food everything was great my boyfriend had some tacos and a quesadilla the quesadilla was very good also if i m ever in tucson again i will be returning to this wonderful taco place

3899,the food here is just wow this place is awesome we ve already been back within two weeks of trying this place for the first time we can t get enough of the fried chicken chicken and biscuits mashed potatoes and cole slaw everything is always so flavorful so fresh tasting and so delicious the atmosphere is really bright and welcoming very open with plenty of seating that doesn t feel crammed together all of the staff are always lovely definitely gonna keep coming back
3900,very good jamaican joint reasonably priced and definitely well portioned meals i always enjoy the curry goat
3901,this is an honest review from someone who enjoys eating delicious authentic mexican tacos i didn t know what to expect from heffe in regards to their slogan tacos that dont suck let me tell you that the tacos are delicious with fresh ingredients and omg the churros are not that frozen crap you get from some mexican restaurants in philly in fact they are homemade churros that are hard to come by they also have good customer service with ample dining space kiosks are convenient so you don t have to wait in line
3902,fresh food that hits the spot and price is just right chicken lomein is superb and sesame chicken with fried rice is very flavorful all the options in the menu are so good and portion size is perfect
3903,recently had breakfast here which was the first time i ve ever been to the roost i had a belgian waffle with butter and maple syrup pretty standard fare and it was good this is a solid breakfast place and is on par if not better than many of the other breakfast restaurants in the area
3904,i debated writing this because i really like the people who work at lather but both times ive gone there i ve been extremely disappointed i wanted to like it based on reviews and pictures i ve seen of other clients but i always leave without feeling in love with my hair the second time i went i had an updo with a braid and when i expressed i wasn t happy with it they made me feel as if it looked nice i felt pressured to accept what was done i spent a lot of money for something i feel i could have done myself the hair cut both times were just fine
3905,we were visiting in from il my wife daughter are vegan but i m not i tried their county style dish with a lemonade a great meal very pleasant staff awesome energy experience if we re ever back in in we will make it a point to add three carrots to our agenda
3906,ristorante attilio is an old fashioned italian american restaurant on the west side of wilmington just a few blocks south of little italy despite having an outdated dining room and not accepting credit cards attilio s serves good food with good service i shared the large antipasto salad garden greens salami olives tomatoes etc and it was pretty good the center of the meal at attilio s however was the home made pasta i ordered the spaghetti and ravioli with meatball the delicious delicate fresh spaghetti and ravioli are made by mamma vincenza s carefully trained staff the ravioli filled with ricotta and herbs among other ingredients are delicious as well however the red gravy stands out here as the star of the meal the tomato sauce has a unique roasted tomato flavor and has simmered with basil parsley garlic and meatballs for hours attilio s is truly a family owned and family operated gem a restaurant that i would recommend to all
3907,we stopped in for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised old school diner vibe where everyone was very friendly and the service was prompt the food is good old fashioned simple food like my grandmother used to make we will certainly be back
3908,table rock is a staple of the boise area there are plenty of trails you can hike or mountain bike if you re nuts to the top if you re not into fitness you can easily drive to the top as well enjoy fantastic views of the valley and try to catch a sunset if you plan on heading there in spring or fall months remember a jacket you re almost a 1 000 feet higher so that wind can pick up while you re at the top
3909,the korean wings are really good i like that they use real fresh chicken even for the boneless wings the mega fries were solid and i like the variety of sauces although i do wish they had a better garlic parm
3910,this place is amazing a family owned restaurant that makes the best mini chimis a must try
3911,it really wasnt worth the wait for me personally i would rather have little chicagos they have buffalo chicken on the menu but you have 2 options dry rub which i didn t care for because it was sweet and sriracha which i don t like at all no hot or mild options we were told that it would be 45min for the deep dish the first round of chicken came out probably about 15min before the pizza so that sucked our waiter wasn t that attentive it wasn t busy i ve never been to a restaurant where the entire staff sits at a table and converse and prep and chill while they re waiting on their customers food to get ready it was different but like i said it wasn t busy the pizza was ok for me compared to where i always go this place comes in second and it s just not worth the wait
3912,got to try place we got there just in time before the crowd and it was delicious eggs florentine and the pancakes
3913,it s costco it is accessible and has a gas station the sam s club down the road has no gas station as long as you do not have to go on saturday during peak hours it s a great experience great deals and products
3914,visited ole red for the first time this weekend and we found ourselves choosing this place over and over during our vacation today was our last day in nashville and we went back to have lunch at this incredibly air conditioned gem not only were the food and drinks phenomenal our server aaron from texas was amazing he was very attentive and professional and he provided great customer service while we enjoyed the music for a couple of hours we will definitely be back to ole red next time we re in nashville
3915,had dinner there last night the food service were terrific their buffalo wings are some of the best i have ever eaten our server jo took awesome care of us like we were a part of her family the only disappointment was the salad too many stems made it taste too earthy otherwise i will definitely visit here again,went here for lunch recently food is good decent service was great and fast if you are looking for a quick reasonably priced lunch it s worth it this is not fine dining but good chinese food
3916,easy place to get too the meals are price reasonable the only fault was there were a lot of dirty tables
3917,the best tacos good wings and great gyros this place rocks
3918,walked in and the 3 employees at the door looked away to avoid seating us finally a young woman took us to our table and said she would bring us some water while we looked over the menu she never came back 15 or so later our server came she was very nice and was apologetic food took long to come out tri tip torta was dry and hard to chew bland kids loved the mac and cheese i didn t like the overall experience and won t be coming back again
3919,iced vanilla latte vietnamese coffee cold brew chocolate chip cookie sweet and salty very good
3920,the best for sushi and non business lovers food and service was just amazing i will definitely be back
3921,vegan soul food was absolutely incredible sure to satisfy your hunger highly recommend
3922,i kind of don t want anyone else to know about angelina s but this review is a testament to the great experience i had there this intimate cash only byob restaurant looks like it occupies a former single family home there are only a few tables and it is a small operation i live in the neighborhood and when i walk by i often see angela herself in the small kitchen through the window on 8th street and that s how your food is prepared carefully and thoughtfully by angela maybe with some help from her daughter angelina s is not inexpensive but it s an affordable indulgence offering excellent quality and service for the price which isn t true of many restaurants in center city my family enjoyed the salad salmon eggplant spaghetti special and tiramisu that homemade tiramisu is incredible and generously portioned one serving is plenty for two people the only downside is that options are limited for vegetarians like me but i realize that this follows traditional italian cuisine our server was lovely and attentive and he deserves an award for chasing us down the block after dinner with the prescription sunglasses we left behind
3923,love this neighborhood store carries a lot of unique items at reasonable price ranging from st louis only personalized souvenirs to handmade jewelries and baby clothing some could be laser engraved
3924,thursday night and wonderful life music james taylor style food is great and service friendly yummy red sangria too
3925,don t miss the turn because this smoke shop is worth the visit located off route 73 in a quaint shopping center scyfli fits the definition of pleasant the co owner andre was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable quick easy trip had my exus plus within minutes of walking in i greatly appreciated the wide variety knick knacks not a typical smoke shop with long rows of only glass pipes though the variety here was exemplary for market prices 5 out of 5 would shop again
3926,very good sushi i would give this place more stars if the dining experience on a peak night was better it s a small restaurant so it s tight in there what bothers me is that the waitresses don t seem to have a problem bumping into you or rubbing their asses on your chair consistently throughout the night just to walk by i gave the startled look many times and they didn t give a crap happened many times just unacceptable the place is good though
3927,i was mildly disappointed by my visit here let me just say that service was great and the venue was awesome my issue was the food i didn t expect full on authentic latin food i expected authentic tasting modern latin dishes and taste just isn t there i ordered empanadas and that is where i stopped i would still go back for the bar and food but not for latin food,arguably the best tasting ethiopian food in the mid west i travel 100s of miles to eat their food it s that good it is as authentic as it gets with out actually going overseas or to atlanta dc their tej is also delicious i hope it stays the same and doesn t change
3928,friendly and efficient and delicious food the bibimbap is my favorite go to meal for lunch
3929,absolutely loveeee diners and jewish deli s and this is a jew diner highly recommend the pastrami sandwiches they put a lot of twists on them i got it over latkes and the latkes were perfectly crispy this place is decently priced i would give it a 5 star except that the decor was still like the old ownerships except for the easter themed counter and that it doesn t include a free salad bar or dessert
3930,just tried the food it was excellent the best i have had in the area had kung pao beef and basil shrimp with the pork fried rice all very good delivery was fast as well
3931,tl dr if you re just looking for a quick suggestion get the cuban sandwich and the congris or the sweet plantains or ask the owner he s a great guy and can help you figure out what you might like best the combination of the best cuban sandwich in indianapolis and great service makes taste of havana a must stop destination upon first entering if you are lucky as every time i have been you are greeted by the charming owner if it s your first visit get the cuban sandwich the congris and the sweet plantains they re all classics that you cannot go wrong with after ordering at the counter and getting your number receipt grab your drink and head over to the window bar seating facing broad ripple avenue and watch people walk by or grab a table to sit and talk with your friends and family while you wait on your food whether it s the authentic cuban sandwiches the amazing congris the eye catching ambiance or the service you can tell a whole lot of love and hard work goes into running this place and i plan on eating here as long as i live here if the owner isn t too busy ask him how he found the congris recipe it s good for at least a chuckle
3932,what a great find in town on business in safety harbor and looking for a local place where i can get a vegetarian dish oh my the fried cauliflower small dish was delicious and the beet salad is to die for a great combo for those who don t eat meat and plenty of food the couple i was finding with swore the short ribs were so tasty fall off the bone and melt in your mouth finished off our delicious dining experience we had the fried donuts with a carmel sauce yum will come back when we return in 6 months
3933,i chose this restaurant for valentines we arrived and were welcomed by a fabulous drink at the bar the food was outstanding and plenty to share the staff never missed a beat i will always take family here
3934,this place definitely lives up to the hype it was our first time trying it i got the mullet and my husband got the mackerel and a cup of the clam chowder our kids shared a cheeseburger all of it was gone by the end of our meal just a tip the german potato salad is off the charts delicious nothing at all like traditional potato salad a definite must try
3935,luke is just one of those places hat i have to visit each time in visiting nola it s a great restaurant attached to the hilton hotel that doesn t feel like a hotel restaurant service is fantastic usually i will get to that in a little while was in town with a coworker who is vegan and he raved about the concoction that the kitchen whipped up for him it ended being his favorite nola meal ever unfortunately it set up all the other meals during our trip to be failures because he enjoyed it that much and was impressed by our waiter s knowledge of the vegan diet and how he worked with the kitchen to make my coworker happy thumbs up guy with the ponytail sorry didn t get your name we were so enablers by the service that we hung out ordered more drinks and dessert forgetting our our urgency to make it to bourbon street for a fun night oops fast forward to sunday brunch waiter seemed hungover and slow kept reaching over the table to serve drinks and fill our glasses now i ve never been a server but i am pretty sure that is incorrect etiquette and as much as i have been to luke s all other wait staff made this guy look like a chump anyway we kept trying to warm him up by being super polite and friendly but it was more out of annoyance than anything food is always consistent here although i will say that the bacon bits in my salad seemed more fresh on sunday morning than they did on friday night i also love to get the shrimp and grits when i am feeling like something more hearty luke does it the best get the bread pudding it is a must you can hit the gym the next day no regrets,craving some pasta while in town for work and mirko was close to my hotel i wasn t feeling well so i was happy to see them on uber eats placed my order anxiously awaited 20 minutes only to have my ordered cancelled i started to look for other options but really had my heart set on tasting mirko based on all of the great reviews so i got myself together to go out and drive over there i called first and placed an order so i could just run in pay and pick up the girl who took my order told me it would take 20 25min so i got there 25 min later the restaurant didn t seem too busy so figured my order was ready she checked and said they were waiting on bread ok cool until 10minutes later when i saw baskets and baskets of bread coming out of the kitchen annnnnnd she did nothing i finally asked her if she could check my order and she came back to tell me they were waiting on bread really did she even check apparently no she didn t because my food was luke warm and so was the bread you d at least think the bread would be piping hot since i had been sitting there waiting for it to come out of the oven luckily i had a microwave in my hotel room to warm up my pasta unluckily i didn t have utensils isn t it customary to ask a customer who places a to go order if they d like utensils i should have requested some but i probably would have been told again that i d have to wait for the bread to be ready look the pasta was perfectly al dente i wasn t a fan of the sauce i chose but it was okay it is possible that the food would have been better if i had eaten it warm from the kitchen and not the microwave and with legit utensils instead of poking my pasta with a coffee stirrer but i guess i will never know overall a let down
3936,a local recommended this place to us some dishes were great others not so much we tried the sampler alligator sausage crawfish etouffee gumbo jambalaya bread pudding and of course a hurricane so we got a good mix of everything excellent gumbo fried gator sausage and the best bread pudding i guess it really depends on what you order here can t go wrong with a hurricane
3937,needed tlc after arriving thursday for mardi gras so decided to get a pedi enjoyable and relaxing service will be back next year
3938,manager did help me loud loud loud do not expect to get rest it says quiet time starts at 9 pm but that s when the party starts rooms are old way overpriced operator won t answer despite my 13 calls between 9 10 tonight to attempt to get the parties quiet if i could get my back i d leave now and go elsewhere if you don t care about sleep stay here if you don t care about a lumpy worn out bed then you will love this place ate lunch at the grill and chicken was red on the inside when i showed the waiter he said it was the lighting in all my years this is the worst stay of my life at any hotel
3939,i ve been frequenting this place since they opened over 10 years ago they are a small shop in the food mall you won t find a wide range of options and the sushi isn t cheap however its not overpriced and the chef gives generous sized slices what they do have is very good a great place to stop and grab quick bite or take home i used to get the sea world combo a lot i always asked to substitute the teka maki with spicy tuna now that s how they sell it
3940,step off of central ave into this cozy spot that makes you feel like you re somewhere by the water the tile fish and yellow grouper were excellent and the reasonable prices made it a great value great hand made drinks complimented the meal
3941,we had a very nice dinner here on st patrick s day which happens to be my sister s birthday the server was super sweet and served the cake we brought to celebrate the bartender was so kind and gave my sister a complimentary st patty s cocktail which was incredibly yummy we ordered various dishes tri tip rotisserie chicken pulled pork and a veggie burrito all was wonderful except for the veggie burrito which was lackluster but who orders a veggie burrito at a rotisserie grill my father in law has visited many more times raving about the moist flavorful rotisserie chicken the prices were reasonable portions adequate and service super we will definitely visit again minus the resident vegetarian
3942,ordered their chicken fajita and fish chips chicken was really good fish and chips not so much portions sizes were too little for the price i would expect a little more drinks were alright
3943,we revisited grand isle saturday 28 april and once again enjoyed it the hubs had the jambalaya i had the crawfish and the grits i had not had crawfish in ages and seriously couldn t recall how to properly eat them and the kind server helped me get the sweet meat out of the crawfish which was really kind of her the grits were decadent creamy rich cheesy and topped with crispy bacon they have a decent wine selection unlike so many bars in bourbon street we enjoyed the patio on this beautiful nola day it s a good spot to dine and people watch no wait and the food came out quickly still recommend gi you re welcome
3944,good food good country music had a good time i would go back again walking down broadway looking for music and food go to this place even if it s busy the service is tight on
3945,great food but it is a little touristy i am spoiled because i am a local and go to the spongedocks a lot if this is your first time in the area hella s is a must even if only for their bakery if i could write a separate review for bakery it would be 5 star
3946,out of all 3 natural cafes in santa barbara county this is by far the best the store manager is the friendliest of them all and very welcoming the food is prepared deliciously if anything is mistaken for those with complicated orders and food allergies like mine they will happily fix it atmosphere is modern simple calming and clean i recommend the old town salad swapping out the guacamole for slices of avocado is what i usually do the buddha burrito the zen and the good karma burger buddha burrito mediterranean soup when available black bean enchiladas i add buddha veggies and the local favorite sandwich for appetizers i recommend the guacamole and nachos grande it is very nice that they allow modifications many without charge love this place can t wait to come back
3947,i would personally have sex with every single employee at this establishment and their sandwiches especially the buffinator you are paying for quality food and that s what you will get i recommend they add more possible sides to menu building on what they already have amazing mac and cheese etc
3948,always good and yesterday free cookies nice end to st patrick s day thank you
3949,ate here with my mom on our trip to new orleans overall a decent spot but the food was kinda bland the customer service was definitely on point they got us seated and our drinks in no time our waitress was on point which is why i granted the restaurant 3stars the food definitely could have been better we had green tomatoes along with fried fish dinners and oysters
3950,the portion for large was really enormous love that i can mix and match and eat more than 10 different ingredients in a setting
3951,this was one of my two life changing culinary experiences and yet it was cheaper than many other nashville restaurants the chickpea fritters and rabbit cavatelli are good but not spectacular the chicken liver mousse and especially the braised lamb are to die for i can t wait to find an excuse to visit again meanwhile i need to shave a star off my past reviews
3952,just awesome my orange chicken actually had orange peels sauted with the food never seen that before will definitely go again
3953,very good food with even better service johnathon our waiter was the sweetest and provided us with some amazing recommendations as we are tourists the crab claws was amazing with a sauce to die for he recommend the fried alligator and it was awesome the cajun bloody mary was the perfect blend of spicy and tang definitely would recommend
3954,currently my fave malaysian restaurant i love all the dishes ive ordered here it s our second time to dine here today and we got the kang kong penang jumbo shrimp and deep fried squid tentacles i recommend both the dee fried squid tentacles and the kang kong with shrimp paste as they both taste absolutely good the penang jumbo shrimp was a good serving and the sauce was very rich but i think some people wouldn t like it i won t order that next time since i like seafood which isn t swimming in too much flavorful sauce service here is exceptional except for this one time where our assigned server was overly suggestive in our order choices hahaha definitely a must visit
3955,i love the environment the staff the coffee and every food item that i ve tried at buttermilk provisions
3956,well we arrived and the seas screw the weather report you came here to read a review on the food so here it is 5 no doubt this places serves awesome food great portions and great service dont bother looking anywhere else go here first it s that good
3957,i m not sure who will mind the scenic route but we all know we make that trek for just the juicy tip tri tip that is i go for tip but i stay for the music and the bar filled with liquor why would i leave let s not forget about the sauces and the onion rings is it sunday yet
3958,stopped here while visiting family so glad we did as we all enjoyed our meals so much service was impeccable and a great value we had the chicken little pasta chicken wrap quiche and i had the monte cristo which was the best i ever had i can t wait to go back to tampa just to eat here

3964,originally based on past experiences i was going to give this location a two star rating however this evening early morning at approximately 1 47am i had two extremely helpful and kind taco bell associates take care of me they were running the drive thru window they made suggestions were patient and accommodating i wish my restaurant had more employees like this young man and lady this was the best fast food experience i ve had in a long time
3965,this was my first time back in a few years and i d best describe the food as adequate it s not bad but it wasn t anything earth shattering there was no wait on a saturday morning and the food came out fairly promptly now i did try the poutine poulet chicken sandwich so maybe the burgers were still good but i seem to remember absolutely loving the food here when i last stopped by it s a good place if you re in the area but i wouldn t make a special trip
3966,great food the chicken kebab plate was made to order and really tasty i love places like this family operated and owned will be back soon
3967,i went to the foodery a few weeks ago with my fiance to meet up with someone who recommended it we got paninis mine was the pastrami and the meat was very flavorful it was slightly pricey but there was a nice sit down area the place reminds me of something between a grocery convenience cafe store that also has beer cider and coffee that has a huge selection of craft beer and cider i was able to buy a wyndridge farms cider my favorite i would return but mostly just to buy some craft cider
3968,bomb ass fried chicken red beans and rice pretty solid willie s cocktail daiquiri on point and they were playing the jams for a fast food joint its a good place to get your food fix you don t feel like you re wasting your money

3970,i recommend the grandma s pizza this is something different than most other local pizza places it s square sicilian with fresh mozzarella and chunky tomato sauce with basil on top thin crust delicious and authentic the cheesesteaks and salads are also very tasty
3971,i ordered a ziggy burger and i have to say it is very good my experience was pleasant and my burger was made fresh i waited for about 5 minutes for them to make it it s worth the wait for fresh food
3972,good local joint with a wide selection of beers and great food lots of seating and family friendly if you don t want to be around kids there s an upstairs bar for the 21 and over crowd worth the trip you won t be disappointed

3984,went to the breakfast club on the spur of the moment today saturday just after noon despite the hour we were looking for breakfast this place is terrific i had a very basic order of scrambled eggs hash browns and corned beef hash all were among the best i ve had my wife tried their french toast and loved it plus their coffee is fabulous what more can one ask of a breakfast place their lunch menu looks equally appealing and we ll be giving lunch a go soon the only problem is to do that we ll have to pass on a delicious breakfast such a dilemma
3985,very yummy tacos my boyfriend and i were walking in the city saw the catchy sign then decided to stop by we got one carnitas taco order and a chicken order both were dressed really well with cilantro and yummy salsa very good definitely would recommend this spot and definitely coming back

3989,got the vegan bowl and my sister got the vegan burrito with siracha cauliflower in it the best tasting cauliflower by the way we also got the loaded vegan fries overall the second best vegan meal will be back soon
3990,i absolutely love the food here my boyfriend me and my mom ordered mcalister s the other night my mom ordered the justaspud but added shredded cheese and steamed broccoli the potato was huge and i don t mean like just a little bigger than normal it was enough to feed 2 people it was as big as the to go container that you would normally get a sandwich and fries in my boyfriend ordered the choose 2 the country potato soup and the grilled chicken spud they had on their website a kale and parmesan cheese soup but when he went to pick up the order they told him they did not have that soup the potato soup was still really good though i also ordered the choose 2 the justaspud and the harvest chicken salad the way they make their chicken salad is absolutely delicious i wish i could order just the chicken salad and have some crackers i would be set the prices are really great for the amount of food and quality of food for the 3 of us to have dinner it was only 32 00 and the food your eating is actually good for you i will continue to et here over and over again
3991,we are part of their ongoing maintenance program and are very pleased with it they send us reminders and keep our heater and air conditioner working with no issues their staff is pleasant and helpful definitely recommend sierra air
3992,since i m in town for business and i have an early day tomorrow i decided to let dinner be my vice tonight and i have found a place that is happy to lead me down thay path luke is grounded on local flavors but throw in some pan european flair and choices as well i started with a half dozen boiled shrimp from the raw bar the shell was a bit tough to peel but the meat inside was sweet and delicious they came with an excellent cocktail sauce and a remoulade that i hope to live long enough to duplicate truly outstanding next was supposed to be a burrata salad but it came out with a complimentary crawfish bisque that the kitchen made by mistake i ll gladly eat their mistakes it was spicy and rich with kernels of corn and chunks of crawfish then i got to the salad an unlikely combination of cucumber melon tomato crispy ham let s just call it really good bacon and the silky creamy burrata all married in a mile citrus vinaigrette a very successful melding of flavors i wrapped up with crispy brussels sprouts and crispy potatoes two dishes sharing their adjective the potatoes are fried chunks indeed crispy outside and deliciously soft inside seasoned with herbs and parmesan cheese i don t know why brussels sprouts have become the it vegetable but im glad they have the ones here were finished with some honey and goat cheese a very nice combination all in all it was a very satisfying meal the service at the bar was just the right amount of attention and the noise level in the room was convivial but not overwhelming
3993,pumpkin pancakes keeps the pantry packed and poppin another legendary restaurant in nashville the pancake pantry was on our shortlist during a trip i took to the city of country music with some friends this place always has a line apparently but we moved through it pretty quickly and got seated within about 20 minutes the wait staff was pretty no nonsense which was fine they took our orders quickly and quietly made sure our coffee and waters remained topped the dining space looks more like a summer camp mess hall than a traditional restaurant and i felt my inner child coming out as my eyes ran over the dozen or so pancake options on the menu in the end i decided to order a medley and two chocolate chip pancakes the medley is a cleverly named medley of all the good things you could ever think of putting in an omelet baked together in a bed of potatoes so its just a little crispy and reminiscent of my dad s sunday hash i substituted american cheese for swiss and added jalepenos and it was fantastic the true pice de rsistance were of course the chocolate chip pancakes that came on the side these were the fluffiest bad boys i have ever had these pancakes were like the weird stuffing you see in old attic walls they were spongy without being dry generously covered in hundreds of mini chocolate chips that melted together as i cut into the dough my only disappointment is that i will probably never get to eat pancakes this good again pancake pantry has ruined all denny s ihops waffle houses and even my dear old grandmother s homemade breakfast cakes for good do yourself a favor and make this place a priority while you re in nashville
3994,a very cute clean place we stopped in for icecream velvety smooth and delicious friendly staff would recommend
3995,fresh food i love it if you want a fancy dinner this is a good option also prices are good service is ok the crab cake appetizer its really good
3996,came to have a drink before an event great little lounge area attentive staff and reasonable prices would ve loved to see the view but it was very foggy would love to go back for dinner
3997,david was great had an amazing afternoon with my lady food was fresh and the staff helped us decide our plates great way to spend an afternoon with friends or a spouse
3998,we went here before a concert it was super busy the service was sort of slow lots of confusion with drinks and food we were dropped food that wasn t ours multiple times while we wait for our own orders my cocktail was pretty gross the fig and goat cheese flatbread was very good and so was there flank steak,this is my go to place for all of my pet needs everyone there is extremely friendly they are always smiling and eager to help you they will even bring your purchases out to your car i highly recommend joining their rewards program
3999,i really wanted to like urban village but my visits left me slightly disappointed it was very crowded because of the basketball we quickly got seated but it was confusing because there were a lot of empty tables that for some reason we were not allowed to sit they didnt seem reserved most importantly we were not very impressed with the beers my first visit and the same holds for the second visit my friend and i sampled all the of the beers and overall all the beers seemed unnecessarily bitter i admit i am biased and am not in love with overtly bitter beers and lacking in flavor i don t think any of the beers tasted like the description listed i did enjoy their malt whiskey beer it actually tasted more like a mixed drink than a beer all in all the beers paled compared to nearby breweries like evil genius and st benjamins their rose pizza was delicious but the fries were left in the fryer for too long and not seasoned at all also the beer cheese sauce addition was 2 dollars which seemed like a bit much
4000,i am always on the hunt for a good poke place where ever i go this place from the outside looks like it s located next to ha long bay but its actually part of ha long bay we did walk in from the poke side but sat in ha long bay side incase we wanted something from their menu as well we ended up sticking to poke i ordered the poke bowl with salmon tuna cucumber jalapeno sesame seeds and seaweed flakes i wanted to keep mines as simple as possible for the flavor i chose poke spice and spicy mayo for 10 95 it was good and the portion was good it didn t leave me full but i didn t leave hungry it came with a side of shrimp chips which brought back childhood memories i used to love seeing them get fried up and expand into chips definitely a good place to stop in for poke i really liked that they had multiple flavors to choose from but i really hope they would consider having brown rice as well
4001,awesome spot live music great wine selection hence it s a wine shop excellent bartenders great music don t be scared grab a table or spot to stand and sip on some good wine or creative cocktail didn t try any menu items but i m sure they are great yes you may have to wait in line for a few minutes but relax it s worth the wait
4002,everything about this place was amazing we made reservations for the balcony and had dinner at 7 it was great we were able to enjoy great food cocktails while watching the sunset and had the mississippi river to the right of us all the staff we came in contact with were so nice and engaged in conversation with all of us i d highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to visit the french quarter they are also kid friendly and had a great kids menu to choose from,great tour of the mississippi it can be extremely hot depending when you go and where you sit id recommend purchasing the dinning plan option
4003,love that there are fun restaurants in speedway now this has a great atmosphere exactly what you would expect from a bbq restaurant the food is pretty good not great bbq but we would go back if we are looking for a bbq place that is close to home,i really like the atmosphere at livery it s very cool and rustic but a little modern industrial too an awesome place to go and sit at the bar and have some drinks the food is really good too i ve had the stuffed piquillo pepper and really liked it my husband got the canelones and really liked those too we will be coming back to try more,i really love coming here with my mom and sister it is gigantic and there are always new things to see the staff is really helpful and takes your purchases to the front counter as you are shopping so you don t have to carry them around we always find cute glassware drinkware bowls vases etc they also have great furniture and decorations and trinkets galore
4004,food quality is great even for lunch time specials as you know most establishments use specials to use up supplies the salmon was cooked perfectly the angus ny steak and filet migon are meat so cook to your preference i chose medium well and i got that exactly serving size is a bit small but maybe its because lunch special so benefit of the doubt great place to eat this place is byob
4005,great cuban food and reasonable prices it gets packed during lunch time and there s not a lot of room inside good and attentive people,cool little restaurant with a lot of healthy options i tried the recoverii smoothie it was good but not worth the price 6 50 for a small cup
4006,yes that s all i can say this was a great tour ernie was a great guide funny knowledgeable personable highly recommend this tour of the famous st louis cemetery great price and well worth the money,i went to a lot of restaurants in new orleans while visiting this one was near our hostel and i wanted a quick southern breakfast to go ok well the food is good obviously i didn t expect any less but the waitresses were so darn nice some of the nicest people i met down there i wish i had went earlier during my vacation because i would have went there every day for breakfast but if you are anywhere on st charles avenue near this diner please go in you won t be disappointed
4007,i had the bianca pizza with chicken and it was excellent service was quick and they explained everything to me my wife had the margarita pizza and liked it

4010,place was great first time here service was superb i ordered a filet was made to perfection along with mashed potatoes my husband had no complaints about his salmon just flaked right off didn t have a full feeling when we left was a great first time and will definitely be back
4011,this is the pool side service and restaurant at the ritz it is great food fun drinks and fast service there is a nice variety of menu choices i really liked the outdoor bar patio atmosphere the food and drinks are pricey but typical resort prices one complaint is that we were scolded for having outside beverages at the pool all we had was a corona that my husband got at the gift shop they keep tabs on you constantly watching staring like vulchers also they do harass you relentlessly at the pool to keep ordering more drinks sometimes you just want to read a book or take a nap some of them will have an attitude if you don t want 20 cocktails nonstop back to back i wish there was a way to signal them when you want to bothered one day i just gave up reading,this place was fantastic great menu for brunch with a lot of great options to pick from everyone in our group loved their drinks and food the service was fantastic and the atmosphere fun also the location is great highly recommend
4012,this is a nondescript restaurant in suburban kenner a short drive from the airport if you are hungry and love seafood this is the place to come just expect a bit of a wait even at 2 p m on a sunday well past the lunch rush we still had about a 20 minute wait not bad though we started with the fried alligator our assessment it was tasty the flavor is like chicken slightly stronger but not unpleasant and somewhat chewier the sauces that came with it were ok not great one was sort of like 1000 island but with way too much vinegar one was a ketchup based bbq the other was tartar sauce then came the main course the plates were just ginormous i had the fried seafood platter which came with a stuffed crab shrimp fish catfish and oysters along with cajun spice crispy potatoes my spouse a louisiana version of low country boil with shrimp andouille sausage and potatoes the fried foods mostly retained their flavors well the crab was my favorite the shrimp was also very good and so were the oysters the catfish was the only part i felt didn t live up to the rest of the platter the potatoes excellent first bite my thought was i don t taste the cajun seasoning within a few seconds it came on strong very impressive the louisiana low country boil was well executed well cooked we both had to take boxes back to the hotel because the portions were so large the service was very good the only ding i give here is that our server didn t come back often and my water ran dry a couple of times but she was friendly i would just say busy
4013,fabulous ambiance fabulous food fabulous service w matt scallop dish really terrific and worth the drive there the steak frite was better than it could be anywhere else this restaurant was excellent
4014,the family and i are visiting and decided to stop in for lunch the staff was nice and the place was clean the food was ok but a bit over priced for what you get
4015,so good visited here for lunch during a work trip and definitely happy we did the service was great and the food was wonderful i got the corned beef sandwich with the voodoo chips and i scarfed down every bite the sandwich was amazing full of flavor the service was quick even during a busy lunch period which helps for those of us on a time crunch will definitely eat here again next time i m in the area
4016,cute lovely place in a hidden location the service was great and the owners were lovely had the chicken and waffles and it was amazing 10 10 would eat here when i m in town again
4017,we sat outside they are pet friendly it was the best breakfast we had and i m very much a breakfast person the device was great and the food original
4018,my husband and i stayed in germantown section of nashville and ate breakfast both days during our stay the staff the food the attention to detail was top notch we sat at the little bar they have and enjoyed watching the hustle bustle of the staff who showed true southern hospitality to each other and the patrons i highly recommend the butter pecan pancakes no frozen home fries here amazing smooth french roast coffee loved this place
4019,i was looking for somewhere to go for lunch on a health conscious flavorful sort of tip and i most assuredly found it this is one of the now two vietnamese restaurants i ve crossed in new orleans with this particular style of lemongrass chicken the other being in gretna to which i kinda hate to traverse and i thoroughly appreciated it had it with rice and i enjoyed two fairly interesting drinks with it though i can only currently recall the names of them while looking at the menu my fault bad short term memory back in task the plate had enough food on it to eat twice if you eat moderate meals and the prices are extremely modest especially considering the area and the style of food frankly there are far less flavorful options for steeper fare so the fact that it was happy hour was only the cherry on top only spent about 27 before tip had a bit of conversation since it was a little slower and i thoroughly enjoyed myself in every way i smiled from the time i entered and was immediately greeted to the time i left and got into the car where i checked in and began writing this review in my time there i didn t get to try the much lauded whiskey sunrise about which most of the visiting yelpers have previously raved but the other two cocktails i purchased were enjoyable and it s more than safe to say i will definitely be back with company to try it out
4020,this place was phenomenal the food i must say was some of the best italian food i ve ever eaten i also unfortunately have a broken cap on my front tooth ugh so i had to order something that was soft and good for a tooth problem the flavors screamed old world italian and kids adults were very happy with their meals i had a pesto sauce on a long thin noodle cooked to perfection there was chicken parm at the table and it was not overly fried very tender and flavorful this is a
4021,a bonus find for out of towners looking for lunch before longwood gardens food delicious attentive yet subtle service by sean happy staff worth the price
4022,we had two pizzas delivered loved the flavored crust all in all very tasty pizza crust was a bit soggy but otherwise good
4023,we have been to many a bluewater grills in socal we were looking forward no matter how long it took for the santa barbara location to open we live there now we were lucky enough to be invited to one of the rehearsal dinners had a great time and looked forward to coming back once officially opened so things go a little downhill at this point thought that going upstairs for a sunday happy hour with that beautiful view was something to look forward to but when we arrived it seems no happy hour depending on you ask the downstairs bartender said happy hour in 5 minutes at 3 00 the hostess said manager just informed her they were no longer doing happy hours on sunday the upstairs bartender said happy at 3 00 but only at the downstairs bar then at shift change the new upstairs bartender said she had no idea that happy hour was cancelled when we told her we were told that there was no longer any happy hour on sundays she responded well that news to me i think it s happy hour food is pretty good prices are pretty good service not so much but because it s terribly mismanaged management s attitude was take it or leave it let s hope it s just some growing pains
4024,i normally do not order burgers but was in the mood for one and boy am i glad i was it seems crazy to say a burger was delicious enough to review about but it was i literally made everyone at my table try a bite they all agreed while the wait was extremely long to be seated it was worth it that day the sun was shining and i had ordered a pitcher of mimosas and sat outside drank chatted and enjoyed the bright morning with my friends until a table was ready they had oysters too which i thought was fun they are pretty small but they aren t expensive we had some of those too i recommend this place just make sure you have the time to wait
4025,very very good i liked the caterpillar marki and sweet potato rolls in particular
4026,visited this restaurant for lunch after church on sunday their specialty is probably breakfast lunch and dinner menus are very very limited nothing to make them stand out i had there specially hot chicken sandwich and it was greasy and not very tasty way too high priced service was ok hard to get someone to refill our drinks probably won t try again
4027,ludwig s never disappoints my husband hosted his work staff at our home last night and i ordered trays the presentation of the cheese tray was beautiful and the hot food was elegant and delicious made a wonderful impression and i highly recommend
4028,i went here today and the atmosphere was great very open clean and fun looking the girl who helped me was doing a lot but she helped me as soon as she could and brought my drink to me overall great place to get fun looking drinks and even cool ice creams desserts too def coming back
4029,this place is amazing encompasses the true culture of nola the wait was a little long but that s to be expected in the quarters the various mimosa offerings were also a highlight can t wait to visit again
4030,delicious healthy home cooked style food highly recommended
4031,besito is really good i was expecting run of the mill americanized mexican cuisine but they have some real yucatecan food and some central mexican food they have michelada a beer with tomato juice very traditional and jamaica pronounced ham i ka and tamarindo i studied abroad in merida and these beverages made me very happy
4032,it s not bad i had a lengua burrito husband had tacos i liked that they cut my burrito in half i have small hands that made it easier to manage but it was ordinary there are much better places in the area
4033,looked for whiskey bar and chose villagewhiskey on recommendation og cocktail maven and it was casual dress staff was great food was great and duck fat fries finished my patty melt perfectly good selection of whiskey little bartender was great and climbed to top shelf a few times to retrieve or search for bottles awesome probition style bar

4037,server victor was great atmosphere is super cute love the outdoor seating wine was great reasonably priced just wasn t happy with what we ordered tacos and rich girl sandwich too salty and unhealthy overall glad we came because the people and vibe were great
4038,great pasta and pizza the yelp reviews are right on the mark i enjoyed a very nice bolognese along with a simple pizza both met my expectations the atmosphere was pleasant but not fancy or sexy this is a good way to spend a tuesday thursday night but you may want to step it up a bit on friday or saturday cheers
4039,i am so thrilled sushi sho has opened in st pete this is far and away the best sushi experience in the bay area try everything and leave a very happy sushi eater
4040,we ventured to newtown to visit a local winery on our first wedding anniversary found this amazing restaurant on yelp and it felt like we were back in italy where we had gone for our honeymoon the food was authentic and our server crescienzo was amazing even though we live over an hour away we are definitely coming back
4041,delicious phenomenal amazing all of the above i was slightly intimidated at first by the crowd of people huddled around the front window but within 10 minutes i had ice cream and custard in my hands we got the twisted caramel and the christy as someone who likes sweeter things i loved that the christy had a warm brownie fudge and caramel to compliment the custard my friend was a big fan of the pretzels in the twisted caramel and can t wait to try the two together at home if you re not feeling like eating your ice cream in your car there are benches on the opposite side of the parking lot where you can eat your very fast melting treat
4042,i wasn t even going to try this place out but grace stopped me with a free sample of the alligator gumbo which hooked me very friendly and beautiful staff delicious cajun food that rivals new orleans believe me when i tell u that the train wreck sandwich will surprise ur mouth with a savory taste explosion i should have ordered one to go
4043,whether it s a weekday night when we can t even with cooking or a weekend meal out my husband and i love going to the hattery the cocktails are delicious who else has rose sangria and the food is exceptional we get the arugula salad and tuna burger almost weekly in addition to the hattery s awesome menu the staff is always so welcoming we usually have derek as our server who s super friendly and impressively chill and on point even when it s packed in there highly recommend
4044,the food here was creative and very good i had the israeli salad and the mushroom toad in a hole and enjoyed both however it was pricier than i expected with a lunch for 2 coming in over 60 no alcoholic drinks on that tab it really ought to have 3 the decor is kind of upscale warehouse but tastefully done my main complaint is the noise level we were there for lunch and i had to raise my voice considerably so the hostess could even hear me even though the place was only about 2 3 full i realize that noisy is unfortunately in my opinion the trend for new restaurants but this was too loud by any reasonable standard get some sound battens up on that ceiling guys
4045,this in my go to sushi place in center city the food is always fresh and tastes good my go to is the kano crunch house special roll it comes covered in spicy mayo and crunchy caviar on top i recently discovered the ak 47 roll which comes with shrimp tempura cream cheese avocado and a special soy paper on the outside it s very good as well for appetizer i love the rock shrimp which is covered in a sauce similar to spicy mayo and drizzled in soy sauce it is crunchy and amazing the california roll i would say is pretty standard compared to other places they also offer a lunch special on weekdays
4046,great spot for all casual affairs this location is perfect if you just want to grab a cup of great coffee to go or if you prefer to enjoy it inside there is ample seating space to sip at your leisure it is located within rittenhouse area so the parking will be tough i typically park a few blocks south and work my way up walking in the counter to order is right in front and then the seating area is towards the left inside it s upscale but casual lots of tables and even small booths to get a group together for coffee and work many people seem to find this location ideal to open up their laptop and enjoy a good coffee the coffee is what sells this place great roasts with bold rich flavors as you walk in you can smell the amazing scents and it tastes just as great as it smells the workers are pretty friendly and the menu is lean so it doesn t get too confusing when putting in your order the feeling i got was that if i became a regular the baristas would definitely start knowing my name and my order it has that charm which is pretty endearing overall definitely recommend this place and this brand of coffee awesome stuff
4047,food was great i got chicken tikka masala as well as spicy chicken on top of rice samosas and pita bread i also got a mango lassi which was great too the food was good but i suggest you come here as soon as you get it so the foods the freshest because it s set up kinda like chipotle the lady who worked here told me that the owner makes everything fresh in the morning which is great when i went it wasn t that busy so i would recommend going during a slow time like i did if you don t want to wait that long
4048,my phone broke down and i got a new one here and it only took 20 minutes they also helped us set up hbo in a matter of minutes
4049,great time sitting outside for dinner wirh friends first time for the manhattan clan chowder which was tasty although i probably won t get again the fish spread was spot on and my guy enjoyed the burger and the german potato salad our friends had the lunch mullet and the hot dog with soup our tab for four was less than 60 server was attentive and the food came out in a reasonable time really enjoy it here
4050,we came in for rice bowls and love the simplicity of the menu and kind service food came quickly and the entire restaurant is immaculately clean nice seating options and calm decor food tastes great and was just enough for an early brunch meal
4051,my husband and i went there to celebrate his new job we had a great time really lovely wines our salad course was slightly delayed and the wait staff apologized several times and then topped off our wine as a thank you for our patience my caesar salad was very tasty and the dressing was flavorful i had the cheese ravioli with pesto cream sauce as my main and the sauce was so good our waitress gave us complimentary sparkling rose after we finished our meals because she knew we were celebrating so thoughtful and it was very tasty we ll definitely be back
4052,love the mahi fish tacos and enchiladas vegetables verde great prompt service and excellent menu
4053,we absolutely love this place it s just the right touch of old town florissant you would love out of town visitors to see
4054,the kids menu is up to age 10 i d say the portion is right up to age 6ish except the grill cheese that is a whole sandwich the clam bake was a good value the ribs appetizer were a little too charred for my taste the portion size for adults was just right but more on the small size the short ribs is a little on the smaller size as well ok value for the food close to liberty bell and attractions which make its nice
4055,got lunch here oysters crawfish and beer it was awesome oysters were huge and salty crawfish had good size and were soaked not sprinkled they had a good spice to them that didn t burn up your lips
4056,the best authentic tacos i ve had in nashville hands down i got shrimp fish and steak tacos delicious and freshly prepared i will be back to sample more of what 51st deli has to offer
4057,i went into the store today because i had a 5 off coupon and i was looking for a drug store bb cc cream i walked around for a little looking at higher end products then made my way around to the drug store products a worker who was super busy the store was restocking stopped to ask me if i needed help after talking for a few minutes and listening to me suggested i go over to the clinique bar the girls there were super helpful they color matched me with a lightweight foundation after she did a section she went and did my full face and even did some concealer after she finished she made me some samples of the products and gave me a sample of a primer because i mentioned my pores on my nose are huge all in all super helpful not the first time i ve had great service here either will definitely go back
4058,i m reviewing this one due to the online ordering the food it s white castle it s always good for fast food love the online ordering had to wait a couple of minutes for the food but worth it
4059,i m impressed with the owner s respectability i brought my black 2016 honda civic ex l here yesterday for a touchless wash but was displeased with the results after conveying that displeasure in a yelp review which i ve replaced with this one the owner reached out and offered to make things right and he did i ll definitely be back important note i didn t share the details of my experience because i don t want others to try to take advantage of the owner i m not a fake for hire reviewer trying to boost his ratings just check out my other reviews i m just trying to do right by the owner because he did right by me
4060,this place is amazing did the tasting menu and everything was so tasteful the duck fried rice was incredible dan was a great server very attentive portions are generous and despite the menu note of small medium or large so impresses
4061,started off with queso dip was one of the best queso dips very rich and lots of other flavors went well with the multicolored chips main entre was the ahi tuna tacos very flavorful and a lot of tuna on each taco three tacos on the plate along with rice and beans very flavorful and filling meal atmosphere is excellent lots of tvs to watch sporting events service is excellent also
4062,great place for really good greek dining even though touristy area this is authentic greek food served with care and excellent ingredients very fair prices too nice greek wine list with beers and greek liquors staff is knowledgeable and very helpful we ve been here several times and never disappointed busy place but they handle it well great appetizers ump pagels and big selection of great greek dessert we shared a gyro platter with 3 appetizers and dessert and price was less than 40 great buy for exquisite lunch i will return
4063,great customer service and it felt like home if you can try the bread pudding so yum
4064,really great neighborhood place food and drinks are better than expected it s a laid back place to relax with great and friendly service
4065,the food was really good today the drive was worth it the gyro platter was good the greek salad was really fresh
4066,oh my the hummus excellent served with sliced zucchini and carrots my husband that loves lobster bisque said it s probably the best he s ever had plus the stuffed squash with couscous was awesome crab cakes yummy too what a delightful place too i m vegan plant based eater so finding a place that is excellent with both options is a bonus and looking at other tables meat eaters would love eating her too drinks great staff awesome and another fun bonus was the piano playing with some new and old music for everyone what a great find for sure
4067,really enjoyed mani pedi with cosmetologist gina saldana she is really attentive to details felt pampered
4068,lovely atmosphere with beautiful outside seating and great food my mom and sister enjoy their broccolini caesar salad and love their their pepperoni pizza because it is loaded with pepperoni for dessert they loved the assortment of cannolis they also have a puppy park on the side where you can bring your dog and eat they will bring water for your dog as well we love this place
4069,i am so bad at remembering to give a review right after i visit a restaurant anyway my wife and i made a second visit here about two and a half months after our first visit this time we came without the kids and when we were greeted we were asked about them we had only been here once before and the manager asked about them and it s not because we were so obnoxious that we would be unforgettable lol the food was great and the service excellent i highly recommend gran agave this is our go to mexican restaurant
4070,this has a lot of potential but unfortunately falls short in a town that s regarded highly when it comes to cuban food the chicken bowl was very basic over salted and overpriced
4071,love coming here for my gel mani and pedi such attention to detail and my nails have come out perfect every time i am in town for an internship and this place is much better than my place back home wish i could come here all the time,very cool place the food is fresh and delicious and the donuts are so unique and seriously good i have had the fried chicken sandwich as well as the burger sliders and both have been divine highly recommend
4072,i stopped in nashville the other night for the first time and this ice cream shop was across the street from the restaurant i had dinner at friendly service quick and the ice cream was so good probably some of the best ice cream i ve ever had
4073,just a pleasure stayed there for 6 weeks the most comfortable bed and pillows i have ever experienced it s quiet when you work unexpected long hours the room is spacious and the staff helpful if you need a room for a long stay this is a place for you close to restaurants and shops in metairie whole foods trader joe s and about 10 minutes from downtown friends who stayed in town always had parking problems when streets were closed for parades marathon etc not in metairie always open and a big enough parking lot to accommodate the guests
4074,always busy but always worth the wait food is always fantastic the servers are unique and friendly everything is fresh and perfect
4075,banana pudding is amazing you can get the extra toppings but just plain no nana is great they care about their customers and are always welcoming i love supporting their shop and hope it s around for years
4076,there s honestly nothing more to say here but hands down the best bagels ever stop in here for good service and great prices,the sushi was okay the service was terrible we ordered hibachi and after 35 mins of waiting it never came so we canceled the order our server came over maybe twice during the whole time we were there i had to flag her down to ask for a drink sushi portions were big but the inside of the rolls was smaller it isn t anything i d hype about or return for the environment wasn t bad
4077,one of the cheaper lunch specials around but i m not sure it s worth it cheap chopsticks sloppily assembled fairly pedestrian lunch sushi
4078,oyesters were fresh and well priced service was good i had the special with fried shrimp crawfish etoufee and jumbolaya it was good had a jalapeo margarita the drink was ok nothing special overall i d go there again
4079,i love this place the beer selection is amazing and the craft beers on tap are constantly updated the bartenders are most excellent and will mix you exactly what you hoped for the food is surprisingly good i m serious the food is excellent i highly recommend the burgers and the sidewinder fries will change your life if you like wing try the sweet chili teriyaki the prices are fair and reasonable
4080,enjoyed my small cup of soup of the day italian wedding soup which i paired with the small pear and blue cheese salad the salad had lots of blue cheese pears were crunchy and not overly ripe and candied walnuts for more texture and taste wonderful salad and so reasonable we sat outside admiring the greens
4081,customer service was outstanding pat had my phone fixed within 30 minutes i called apple and they told me i had to wait two days i ve never had a good experience when it came to my phone this places made getting my phone fixed super easy i recommend you go here if you need your screen fixed prices are so reasonable
4082,absolutely amazing food incredibly friendly staff our waiter shane was fantastic and friendly the place is cute and has the perfect reno midtown feel the food oh my goodness is perfect great fried rice great protein plates and awesome appetizers highly recommend
4083,the place is clean and the server is nice and patient the food is good too i ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl i don t like cabagge so i didn t eat it but that one comes in a separate plate so nothing to worry about
4084,amazing food had breakfast there a few days back and both the food and service were great super quick at a reasonable prive
4085,this is not the best chinese food around as a matter of fact the best around is only one block away but i give this awesome place 5 stars anyway why you ask well i ll tell you the best around is pick up only and is cash only when i have that magic double formula at my disposal i go straight to number 5 locals will know however when that criteria is not met when i need delivery or i need to use a credit card i need a place that is up to the task of serving awesome chinese food enter pearl of the east its been my standby for years but a car smashed through the window a couple years ago and i forgot all about this place well i ordered tonight its as good as i remember and as i type this i m thinking i might even like the garlic sauce better then number 5 add the fact that they were not cheap with a random assortment of sauce packets and gave a whopping 8 fortune cookies with my order which included a free quart of won ton soup for meeting a certain dollar spent threshhold i am glad they are back and i will most certainly return and recommend them although i may not be totally ready to break up with number 5
4086,quick service but mediocre cheesesteak taste ask for extra provolone or if they do mozzarella that s my advice
4087,first timers at this little gem the food and desserts were amazing byob the staff were friendly and helpful but we needed a little more attention one little nit the place needs new rugs disgusting the tablecloths need to be burned and buried
4088,loved the atmosphere located in the funk zone packed house on a tuesday night and rose on tap my husband enjoyed an ipa quick service at a very busy taproom
4089,my friends and i were looking for places around reno to try new food we ve been here about twice now and we absolutely love it i enjoy their vegetarian dishes especially the mesir wat which is lentils cooked with spices i look forward to coming back and trying the rest of their dishes the owner is very friendly and stated that she remembered us from our previous visit a couple of months ago
4090,went for brunch put our names on the no wait app and still waiting almost an hour the hostesses and people at the front are a little snobby they have 5 6 standing there all gossiping and giving an attitude to people as they check on their reservations think they can handle their foh a little better got the cannoli french toast and the fly bene fly benedict was incredible ordered a carafe of oj for mimosas and that was more than a meal was like 14 at one point it did feel like they were trying to push us out and flip the table which is always annoying despite a couple little things the place is awesome and cute setup and decor will be back
4091,what a great place tucked into a serene little spot just off of fairview avenue sockeye brews up some amazing beers and serves them along with equally delicious fare today we enjoyed the chicken strips onion rings and a meatloaf sandwich that simply melts in your mouth paired with sockeye s sour puss it was filling had to take some home and very satisfying we love this town
4092,this place was soooo unexpectedly delicious we had charred carrot hummus shabazi fries bean fattoush roasted cauliflower and the bean tagine every dish was flavorful inventive fresh and amazing kudos to the chef and owner definitely coming back
4093,i ll give it to them papa murphy s is one of my favorite places for pizza and their cookie dough is phenomenal take and bake pizza are a genius idea and normally i have five star service however i visited this location tonight to pick up my order and was left waiting at the pick up window for over six minutes meanwhile i watched the staff on their cell phones genuinely ignore me at the window i tried to get their attention but clearly they were preoccupied i then parked my car to head inside and saw one of the workers clearly facetiming someone while the other worker hurried to look busy as i walked in my pick up order was fast but i simply could not believe i was ignored at the pickup window it s simply distasteful customer service and a reason to visit another location
4094,visiting nola for the first time with friends to celebrate my husband s 60th birthday we wanted to get out of the quarter for the evening and found bacchanal we couldn t have been more delighted with the atmosphere the food and of course the wine we asked james the person at the door what he would recommend and he wholeheartedly recommended the grilled pork chop james was not wrong this dish is perfection absolutely the best experience don t waste time with the tourist places find bacchanal and enjoy yourselves
4095,robin was fantastic friendly helpful and really knowledgeable she was all about customer service and ensuring our evening was delightful thank you and we ll be back p s thank you bri for stopping by and checking on the experience we were having
4096,i have been here a few times for lunch and dinner and also had a small wedding dinner here in their private room i ve never had a bad experience the food is delicious and you can see and smell the kitchen on the second floor even with 15 picky eaters our group had 0 complaints about the food the drinks are well crafted and unique the spirits are delicious on their own and the the beer selection has choices for every palate the building is very unique and it s a special experience to dine in a nevada historical site huge thanks to nick and all the staff who served us on our special night and those who take care of us when we decide to splurge on dinner this is a place we never regret visiting
4097,this place has a northern california vibe reminds me of breweries in napa very open large space and a good selection of craft beer the other side is a winery which is neat as well i recommend trying their flight of beers to get a taste of everything
4098,excellent pork sandwich i got mashed potatoes and banana pudding as sides all i can say is yum yum the potatoes were probably my favorite real and buttery and chunky yum highly recommend if in nashville
4099,i really like in riva the atmosphere is great especially if you can sit outside in the temperate months as other reviewers have mentioned the portion sizes are really small for what you get back when they had tortellini on the menu i was shocked to be presented with approximately 8 little tortellinis in a bowl granted they re some of the best pasta i ve ever tasted but damnit it was brunch and i was hungover and ready for a big bowl of pasta pizza definitely seems to be the way to go if you re looking for filling and you could totally demolish one of those by yourself you ll love the food but be prepared to order a lot of it
4100,i can t give enough stars started going here a few years ago and can t recommend enough they have a walk in clinic too for when you need to come in for the flu or something not scheduled my np emily sitomer has really helped me and always takes her time with me too i feel she really cares and i will continue coming here too i recommend it to all my friends and family too they built a walk in close to my home too in franklin that is very convenient
4101,amazing food celebrated my birthday here with a big group of friends and we tried 90 of the menu it was all great but don t miss baba ganoush samke nayyeh yellowtail batata harrah potatoes get 2 orders they re that good the kawarma and prawns the lebanese white wine we had was wonderful too crisp and refreshing
4102,no atmosphere but great fish tacos at extremely affordable prices come for the food and you ll not be disappointed
4103,clean therapists were friendly and capable the shared room is small and it s magic the work they get done in there the front desk staff is at best just there to collect a paycheck and at worst just a really apathetic slightly less than nice person overall the pricing is fair and the place is clean
4104,this review is long overdo what a great experience excellent customer service wonderful experience 5 stars
4105,great people great brews great location best neighborhood bar in town
4106,my husband and i decided to go to reeds for our anniversary first the staff are wonderful naomi and becca took very good care of our needs libation summer daiquiri excellent cocktail for dinner i had the strip steak and my husband had the pork schnitzel my steak was grilled to perfection and the schnitzel was perfect the slaw that comes with the schnitzel was delicious my only observation was my steak s a little cold but the flavor and tenderness of the steak made up for the coldness of the steak for dessert we had the lemon olive oil cake perfection the only reason why this is not 5 star is because the steak was cold
4107,love it here i recommend to get the creme brle for dessert mmmm you will not be disappointed
4108,the food is great servers are nice but they are very slow we went in tonight only five tables 2 of which we leaving when we arrived greeted and given water then after 10 minutes we were finally greeted by our server as i said food is great and came out quickly our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and asked for food to be boxed we ordered 3 side dishes an app and a sandwich in addition to 3 cocktails bill was 74 no complaints add insult to injury my boyfriends sandwich and mashed potatoes were never put in bag for the rest of the leftovers now he s walking in the frigid night looking for food after spending quite a bit this was our third time here same experience with service each time doubt there will be a 4th too bad because you re food always hits the spot
4109,during our vacation we have been twice both times we were not disappointed i m definitely envious of the locals we have nothing like this back home
4110,very pretty restaurant great drinks went for brunch had fruit plate omelette lox plate and lemon poppyseed pancakes everything was well prepared pancakes were the best overall omelette was good but last on this list very solid brunch option
4111,first timer today loved it happy hour mon thurs 3 5pm and i think it s 50 1 lb crawfish mussels and some others i can t remember i think sodas beers are 50 off too catch is it is 1 per person so 1 lb of crawfish would be 50 but if you got another pound it d be regular price i ordered 1 lb of fresh crawfish they have option of frozen fresh frozen is cheaper and since it s crawfish season happy hour i decided why not get fresh i got the whole shebang for seasonings xxx for spice because i love can tolerate spicy i also got 1 2 lb sausage corn as well it came out nice warm crawfish was actually huge sausages sliced corn on the cob all mixed double bagged they give you plastic gloves a bib and you are ready to dig in hopefully you don t mind messy eating but it is so worth it definitely coming back again
4112,in search of the perfect biscuit came to this location on a monday morning not busy easy to order and sit down enjoyed the egg plate the biscuit was a little sweet and a tad too greasy but enjoyable really liked the grits delicious the sausage was tasty and good size portion but not hot temperature wise still searching for the best biscuit so far i still like the biscuit at bobwhite counter ave c nyc an additional note i went at 8 30 am on a monday easy to sit quickly but when i passed by at around 11 45 am s line out the door
4113,took a client friend to lunch the other day and had the beef pho soup out of this world but what made it better was having the left overs for dinner we have had the cauliflower burger there before and that was a 10 will make it a point to frequent there more often
4114,service was pleasant the chicken taco platter for lunch was delish and on point the amount was perfect
4115,absolutely loved this place i came here for brunch with 2 girlfriends before going wedding dress shopping and it was a great start to the day it s an upscale yet relaxed vibe all three of us got the lox board and it was so delicious the service was great and we were not rushed at all even though it was a very busy sunday i would recommend making reservations in advance can t wait to visit philly again and come back here
4116,our stay here was fantastic the rooms are very modern and spacious the staff was very friendly in helping us with any questions the rooms are very quiet and the beds are extremely comfortable
4117,best meal in a while chef jen carroll s new restaurant is a hit definitely want to come back soon very good drinks and all the dishes we tried were excellent congrats on your new restaurant chef
4118,the food here is always hit or miss for me and the last time i was there the service was extremely slow 2 hrs for lunch mid week i think the atmosphere and taste of the food make the prices seem high especially when there are other authentic new orleans restaurants not too far away that do it better for cheaper if you re in the area and there s a table open great i wouldn t trek here and i wouldn t wait for a table the specials tend to be awesome and rather pricey some of the main menu items can be total misses and also pricey the cocktails are generally the most consistent thing about the restaurant so i don t mind the price quite as much but they re not cheap i ve always had meh service on every visit so nothing impressive there overall at this point i only go here when other people really want to go if i can convince them otherwise we eat elsewhere midcity has too many other great options at this point
4119,great experience this place has an awesome authentic atmosphere great food and friendly staff i am excited to go there when the weather is nice and they have the garage door open so you can eat in the open air right on broad st we tried the al pastor burrito bowl and tacos both had great flavor and tasted very authentic portion size on the burrito bowl was great tacos are on the smaller side the owner was very friendly and seems to really care about ensuring everyone has a good experience my only recommendation would be that since its 3 tacos for 9 it would be cool to be able to add a 4th or maybe 5th taco for a discounted price for people who have big appetites overall i would give this place 5 stars for great tasting food extremely friendly staff and fun chill environment it is a great addition to south broad street in center city
4120,i definitely found my favorite boat parts store it s a tiny place but ben the owner somehow figured out how to fill it with a great selection of parts and products ben was extremely welcoming and helpful he has his dog dakota in the store which creates a very relaxed type of environment his prices are very reasonable unlike waste marine i ll be stopping by this place first before i go anywhere else he had what i needed in the store but he did mention that he can get me anything if i don t see it the best thing about this place is it s 5 minutes from where my boat is stored which means i ll be visiting it quite a bit in the coming years
4121,i always visit ladue nails and spa when i need to do my manicure and pedicure the nail technicians were very nice the store was extremely clean and i was very satisfied with the results
4122,go to the second floor bar over looking the river the service with rickey is fantastic the oysters are amazing and the happy hour is worth the time
4123,lovellyyyy place 100 on the food my fave is the crawfish pasta with catfish crabmeat oysters not too fond of the basic crab claws for the price other than that food is just immaculate
4124,i visited herbies at their new location for the first time this past sunday evening we were seated outside which i loved service was so so 3 requests for iced tea with lemon before the lemon actually appeared friendly no so much attentive average in every way french onion soup was good but my entree was very disappointing i ordered the shrimp and grits large the shrimp were great but there was barely a tablespoon of grits to be found on the plate conversely there was a unbelievable amount of sauce it appeared more like soup when delivered and all my table mates comment wow there was enough sauce for 3 entrees on my plate i ate the shrimp looked for a bit of grits and pushed my soup to the side very strange i was not impressed but will likely try again i loved herbies in their old location so i am assuming my dinner was an exception to their regular service
4125,this place is awesome and our waitress theresa went out of her way to make sure i could have what i wanted after having a minor setback the wood fired veggie wrap is sooo good and the hummus mmm
4126,this is my favorite sushi in town good quality and a good price staff is all very nice and love the traditional shoes of tables they re uni is great which is hard to fine
4127,i went to a private event at william collier s and it was a great experience the place was completely packed when i went up to the bar my bartender had two offerings so that made my decision easy they had a photo booth in the corner and music flowing everyone was friendly and i enjoyed my time there there is a outside patio area as well,i m a wish granter for make a wish middle tennessee and needed to plan a wish reveal party for my make a wish child my make a wish child loves jumpstreet so i called them to see if we could do a wish reveal there and they were thrilled to host i had a wonderful experience with them they had an area blocked off for us to do the wish reveal and all the kids enjoyed jumping around the staff were super helpful and kind leading up to the surprise
4128,three words homemade peanut butter rush bowls instantly stole my heart with their peanut butter alone i m not kidding when i say it s easily the best peanut butter i ve ever had anyways i m off topic i had ordered the beach acai bowl with peanut butter and it was amazing the staff was very nice and the menu has a good variety only down side is that it is a little pricy highly recommend if you re looking for something sweet but healthy
4129,service was excellent but when i wanted to pay the bill he went walkabout food was very good but we were recommended to have the taster menu this was far too much food for two people cocktails were interesting but a theme of the places i have visited recently was that they are too weak get the whiskey
4130,we brought our dog care for an emergency several weeks ago sadly our dog passed away but the vet stuff was so good and compassionate and did all the could they were quick to treat her when we arrived and to do all needed tests to determine the problem they were very knowledgeable in helping us make a decision as to what was best for our dog we really liked the vet to the point that we asked if she sees regular visits and were bummed to find out she only sees emergencies the team sent us a card and nice note after the loss of our dog the cost was reasonable and actually less than i expected would definitely come back again
4131,my favorite hotel along with their sister hotel the avalon next door i live about a hour away but come as often as i can because there s so much to do here the pool food and drinks are amazing along with their extremely friendly staff perfect for a special occasion birthday or just a relaxing get away they are also pet friendly which is a huge plus they have a shuttle to take you downtown and pick you up and they always have something fun going on at night
4132,i had a great experience with pinch a penny they were reliable and did a great job working on our pool i d recommend them
4133,food is killer mustard wings are amazing pizza sandwiches salads are all good for lunch
4134,delicious food and a wonderful atmosphere the italian wedding soup is great and so are all the cakes i ve tried so far the whole place is pink and filled with little knickknacks that make it super cute just a little bit over priced
4135,outstanding definitely will come back the next time i am in reno i would recommend the ceviche the cuban and the homemade ginger ale service is good and we got to meet the owner before we left
4136,the reviews are quite accurate first time here visiting from los angeles and it won t be the last whenever i m here my wife had the chicken pesto sandwich and it was delicious i had the tre tacos carnitas and it was phenomenal the carnitas were crispy on the outside and juicy and full of flavors on the inside the tortilla was prepared just like my family does lightly oiled to crisp it up and lined with a little cheese i can t stress how much you all have to try this dish this place certainly earns my business for any future visits enjoy
4137,great for thin crust lovers we showed up around 12 30 and it was empty but quickly filled up ask for the saint lucifer s spice mix to top your pizza it s amazing in addition we tried the meatballs panzanella and argula salads of which i would highly recommend the panzanella and go elsewhere for the meatballs the guy at the gelato counter was very accommodating with letting us sample flavors and let us split a 2 scoop order into two separate cups for sharing thanks gelato guy you are awesome
4138,i always get greeted with a smile here it s always clean and well stocked the salad bar is fresh deli is efficient and baked goods always fresh too the pharmacy staff are excellent too they know who i am and ask me how things are going with genuine interest
4139,best brunch came here on a busy saturday with a group of girls everyone loved their food and drinks waitress was friendly efficient and knowledgeable about all menu and drink items would definitely come here again
4140,great food and execellant service very friendy service if you like rustic and style you got to see this place you will love it i had tri tip sandwich my daughter had the sausage sanwich and my husbend had steak everything was so good so you need to go and see if you don t feel the same
4141,i can t say enough good things about this place and the people who work here it is a huge resort and the perfect place to host a work convention there are tons of amenities here and i could sit on the balcony outside the room for hours did i mention how great the staff is a service all around
4142,we had less than a 5 minute wait on a sunday morning the atmosphere is cozy and quaint the fresh squeezed oj is out of this works and i had the best eggs benedict and mimosa i ve ever had the potatoes are light and perfectly cooked everything was seasoned to perfection
4143,i received immediate attention when i walked in the door a lady asked me if i was there for a driver s license or for motor vehicle she waved me to the counter immediately when i said i needed a title she was quick efficient and friendly
4144,i love getting a beer and hitting the batting cages the bartender has been the same lady each time i have gone i noticed other comments stating she was mean but she has always been real kind to me and my friends i have seen plenty of people deserve the rather and she usually handles them well side note i always meet one person that ends up being really cool so the patrons are a decent crowd drinks are good food is not very good cages are good
4145,sushi bar never disappoints the flavor of the food here is consistent the jalapeo roll is my all time favorite not many rolls have a good combo of flavor and are actually spicy the jalapeo sauce on top makes it other rolls here are great too just have my favorite there
4146,if your looking for great tex mex in west chase look no farther than tijuana flats great food and great staff
4147,i really like this place the shop itself is very clean and easy to get to they do an excellent job on nails and you definitely get your money s worth the staff is very friendly too
4148,steak house western village steak house is the best talked to jason and he was extremely nice and made us feel welcomed and checked up on us regularly we sat with khan he is so funny and is extremely personal we had the tomahawk definitely would recommend
4149,i love ml rose we have been eating here for years they have a phenomenal beer selection and tons of tvs i am disappointed to say that when i had a baby and we brought her here the other night 1 5 year old for a casual dinner there was no kids menu or high chairs we eat out a lot and this is the only place we have ever been that doesn t even have high chairs what
4150,i had an enjoyable dinner her i sat at the bar to watch the warriors win the nba finals the wild mushroom with balsamic was a great appetizer and it went well with a black butte porter the bar staff were very attentive and made good recommendations for my main course i kept it simple with a nice burger some of the other entrees looked interesting too i would not hesitate to eat her again
4151,first and foremost when i first bought the car i had a great experience with philip he was very attentive even while i was waiting on financing it took a while because it was a busy day but he was great i accidentally left my key fob in my old car and phil overnighted it back to me super quick this would be a 5 star rating if this was all i had to talk about now the bad i had to take my car back in due to a recall i spoke with 2 women on 2 different calls who told me this would be a lobby appointment and i d be in and out i get to the dealership and what does he service center tell me oh no this is going to take hours can you pick up the car tomorrow you know not exactly a lobby appointment there was also misinformation about what was exactly on recall i was told it was a possible starter issue then told it s the fuel tank no loaner was offered i was honestly completely sold on buying you guys again due to phil but now it s like wow if i have to deal with the service center should i
4152,i went to the restaurant week last monday the environment was great and i was really full the food is nice
4153,as a big lover of byo s porcini was on my list for restaurant week you pick your app entree and they give a salad for the table and two desserts to share for a table of two it was satisfactory but not sure if i d elect to go back just because there are so many excellent byo s around i got brussels for my app and rigatoni salsiccia my friend ordered burrata and the cheese raviolis we both liked our appies our salad wasn t a hit it had pickles in it and a lemony briney dressing and she loved the ravs my rigatoni was okay and the sausage was excellent the desserts were also good it was tiramisu and another type of creamy cake
4154,pad thai is awesome so is the drunken noodles have yet to have a ok meal here it s great to know there is great thai food in sicklerville delivery is fast and hot the staff is nice and professional it s my go to for thai i am proud to say
4155,like many stores that line baltimore avenue in west philly mood cafe is privately owned and a sister store to desi village and desi chaat house i have frequented desi chaat house more often because they have more variety of chaat but mood cafe has more lassi options i really like their lassi because it isn t that sweet and my favourite is cardamom lassi it has a slight tanginess from the yoghurt and just the right amount of cardamom flavour it s actually really refreshing to drink on a very hot day mango lassi is very good also once again with just the right sweetness and enough mango flavour this time i ordered kashmiri chaat and asked mine to be medium spicy i love eating chaat during the summer months because it s refreshing and kind of helps my appetite when you don t want to eat anything just in case you don t know chaat is one of the favourite indian street food with all kinds of possible combination of veggies crunchy indian snacks fruits sauces and yoghurt the potential of combination seems endless mood cafe is rather small for an eat in they do have limited chairs and tables i chose to do a take out which most times seems more convenient the service is really friendly and pretty efficient i think they over made their mango lassi they gave me the extra portion in a small cup if you are new to this area of west philly you can choose to eat in or take your food and drink over to clark park and have a picnic
4156,i didn t stay here but i can tell you the staff is incredible got caught in an absolute monsoon across the street along with a few dozen other people ran into the hyatt and immediately staff set up a table and brought down a ton of towels allowing non patrons to come in and dry off while the storm passed if you treat people that aren t your customers that well i can only imagine what it would be like to stay here
4157,the line was super long on a saturday night for 6 00pm but it moved rather quickly tried to order brisket but they were already out and had the pork instead had great flavor and was tender the corn bread was extremely dry and could barely choke it down the mac n cheese had great flavor but was more on the room temperature side than warm which was disappointing
4158,came here during a recent trip to nashville came here a couple years ago for brunch which was amazing but a super long wait so beware didn t realize when i picked this place this time that they also do a 2 for 1 drink special from 2 10pm on wednesday nights this is a great deal but makes the night a lot busier i was with an older group of people so they personally didn t like how much noise was going on in the restaurant in terms of food i do feel like it s a little overpriced for what you get but i will say the mahi mahi tacos were tasty i would definitely come back on future trips to nashville and if they take reservations i will do that instead
4159,our first time to really hop the rooftop bar lounges of the four we went to last night the vue was the most charming and the view wow a nice selection of local and ipa beers and a good choice of interesting cocktails the music was great for the atmosphere and volume was perfect for us to still carry on a conversation courtney and her krewe were fantastic we will be back
4160,this is an older hotel there is some maintenance issues the people at the front desk were very mice the cookies in the lobby are one of the best i have ever had
4161,k i ve noticed a trend when in seating for new or remodeled restaurants and that is the uncomfortable seating i have a feeling that the hard seating surfaces are easier to keep clean or something which is important but sheesh that said the interior right down to the hard seating is freaking awesome look at those high chairs made out of pipe and wood neat prohibition theme nice selection of beers and i d never heard of mules before but they have em and they re tasty had the wiseguy fries as an appetizer fries nacho cheese bbq pulled pork if i remember right sour creme and some green onion served in a great big bucket yummy i had the bucket burger with the chipotle sauce amazing came with fries now these are the same fries used in the awesome appetizer right now i m a bit of a fry nazi i want mine more turgid these were flaccid tasted good though just not my thing we also got a chicken wrap that looked good i didn t try it but it came with chips and salsa the salsa is better than the salsa at the mexican place down the street and also had a bit of kick i expected something more bland from a brewhouse i guess nice job will totally eat here whenever i want a beer and some yummy stuff to go with it,chains like this should drive pizzahutdominoslittleceasarspapajohnsetc right out of business the secret is to keep your eye on the name when you order barro s pizza not barro s pasta the pasta is bland you can beat their pasta sauce by using a can of crushed tomatoes and skipping the spices this is ok though because this is barro s pizza and the pizza is solid i order thin crust pepperoni and either sausage onion mushroom or peppers and the haven t missed yet delicious every time i d go as far as saying it s my second favorite in the area the cheesy bread sticks are good too it s also a nice place to eat in and they can easily accommodate groups from the look of it just tell your group to stick to the pizza and pizza like bready things and save the pasta for the 90yo grandma in the group who can t have anything with even a little spice
4162,we had a great experience here we had the spinach pasta which was fresh spinach mushrooms tomatoes and onions with bowtie pasta in olive oil delicious and cooked all dente the salad was also fresh and loaded with variety you have to purchase bread and there is no dipping oil it was a bit disappointing reasonably priced wine by the bottle service was friendly and efficient atmosphere is nice but could use sinatra music not 80 s pop not authentic italian but fresh and delicious we we will come back
4163,the menu is authentically italian which i loved and left wanting to try many more dishes family owned and run with friendly and prompt staff just wish that they sold alcohol for those of us who forget to stop by the liquor store my boyfriend was also not happy as he is 6 7 and they put us at a tiny table in the middle of an aisle so he felt cramped and in the way the whole time our linens and glassware were also dirty so that was a little worrisome but if i lived around here i would be back to try many more dishes on the menu
4164,they have the best bagels in town i have been coming here since high school and still stop by when i am back in town the employees are always friendly and efficient
4165,love this place great food quick service nice place to relax and have a slow paced dinner with friends also able to drive here grab a quick bite and make it back to work during a 1 hour lunch break
4166,the service was good i had the lettuce wedge and not sure what size the head of lettuce was but was the smallest lettuce wedge i have every seen ordered all the other food that our family ordered was fabulous and good size portions we also had the flights of beer i may have left a little hungry still but everyone else had happy belly s little price but was good just avoid the lettuce wedge if you actually want to eat or are hungry
4167,this place has the best chicken tikka masala i ve had after coming to the us the naan is also soooo good i ordered food from here twice during my 5 day visit to tucson love this place
4168,great bang for your buck sushi was fresh and tasty service was fast and kind definitely recommend
4169,dang this place was really refreshing great coffee helpful kind and knowledgeable staff this is my type of breakfast coffee and a baked good or even a delicious avocado toast is the only way i like to start my morning simple great art parking is way too easy as well
4170,recently remodeled eegees on the south side near the airport and not too far from valencia and i 10 almost always clean say about 9 out of 10 clean and usually lots of seats inside except for lunch times there is some outdoor seating in a walled area food is sandwiches but everyone comes for the frozen drinks if you have not had an eegees drink then you have missed out on a excellent tucson tradition you can get a mix with upto 3 flavors sometimes more but i don t recommend more than two single lane drive through i don t like how recently they park everyone even when there is no one behind you i usually just pull to the front door and wait unless another car actually comes behind me parking lot can be tight as it is shared with other businesses biggest grips with eegees is the changing coupon policies they used to take whatever but now they are strict on dates and annual coupon card also i believe they had discounts at age 55 but now they raised it they also got rid of the frito chilito after raising the price several times
4171,holy moses these people are the real deal from wonderful chair massages to foot massages and full body you can t go wrong the owners are kind and considerate of your time they really handle themselves professionally and are true to their word do you need a massage and cannot get in to your favorite spa try this place it s not a spa experience so if you re expecting that don t go but if you want something that makes you feel better when you re finished is completed by kind and courteous people and is amazingly priced go do not hesitate just go,oh my goodness i had heard about costco and wondered what all the hype was about well now i know you do have to have a membership to be able to buy stuff here but it s worth every penny i have been able to purchase things to take with me overseas amazing food for guests disposables for my teenage son and his friends and now i m looking at taking a vacation through costco this place offers so much including samples of some of their foods i have never gone and not been offered a handful of samples gluten free pizzas fresh produce incredible prices and employees who truly seem to like what they do my favorites to purchase are hummus packets paper plates gatorade the large bags of chips or snacks and gifts for friends and family love this place
4172,i absolutely love thai food and this place had great flavors and very good service the manager owner made it a point to stop by and check on us and made us feel incredibly welcome
4173,i absolutely love this hometown local bar the local overs local brews as well as vodkas how cool the atmosphere is clean with a pool table dartboards boardgames and the friendliest staff ever sherry is always so pleasant remembers your name and just makes it a special experience they offer trivia questionarre on tuesdays too this is a locals hangout with a dog friendly front patio area love the local and i can t wait to return
4174,what a great find on our way to the airport looking for a quick bit we stubbles on this jewel my hubby wanted breakfast but i needed one more po boy boy i m glad we stopped
4175,there s nothing really special about this place my boyfriend and i decided to try it out despite the negative reviews i understand what some of the 1 star reviews were for our waitress was nice but seemed like she didn t want to be there and she had a friend there visiting her and she was chatting with her and forgot that we had ordered sak the food was okay nothing really bad about it just not a place i would go back to
4176,great food with affordable price homemade feeling had the seafood basket and it was great
4177,went with some coworkers on lunch food almost took an hr so we had to get it to go waitress did not apologize for the long wait or ask if we were doing okay i was a little disappointed in my portion size of potatoes that s just me being fat i guess everything was delicious though i would eat here again if i had to but it wouldn t be my first choice only because i feel like it s a little overpriced for the amount you get and i m cheap
4178,food was really tasty and authentic i haven t had good mexican food since i left california until now i definitely recommend also the prices were good 40 fed 4 people and that included beverage and 20 tip i will definitely be back
4179,guy fieri recommended the lemon corncakes so of course we started by sharing an order and it did not disappoint be sure to combine the lemon curd and compote with one bite for a wonderful taste we both ordered the build your own 3 egg scramble omelette and having up to 5 add ons was a real treat definitely a great brunch spot and a peek at the lunch menu means we will be coming back for lunch some day soon
4180,with all my stops in npr this was one of my favorites they have a beautiful patio that is the most doggie friendly place i ve found our sweet waitress instantly brought out ice water for our corgi and couldn t get enough of her cuddles food was so good all homemade and great hot choc as the day i went was a little on the chilly side a must stop service was quick attentive and super sweet waitress that was very chatty which i loved busy place but they have it together and no wait or hold up the food omg so good and just yummy can t wait to go back
4181,mori is the sweetest most kind hearted young woman i ve ever met not only did we learn how to make our fav foods she was quite the comic put on a great show mori i will never forget this quote someone told me from maya a you may never remember what someone said to you nor did to you but you will always remember how they made you feel i live by that you made us feel welcomed comfortable like family thank you
4182,kids loved this place lots to discover and learn cost will not break the bank and you can get through it all in about 1 5 to 2 hours even the adults in the group enjoyed our time there
4183,went here for restaurant week and since i was traveling for work getting a 3 course meal for 35 was right up my alley i m writing this 2 months later and i still remember what i ate warm goat cheese salad lamb lollipops and cannolis outstanding so was the service and the free wifi loved and would love to go back
4184,when visiting my friend in tucson i needed to get my brunch on before exploring the city she recommended prep and pastry as her favorite go to spot and girl was she right being extra hungry as one usually gets when on vacation i ordered what i thought to be too much food and basically ate it all cuz it was that good you can get the chili french toast and you will be pleased with the salty sweetness combo as other yelpers mention you can try their take on the doughnut croissant hybrid the dossant which is pretty good however someone in your party has to order the grilled cheese preferably you ordering this grilled cheese sandwich has been one of the best top ten decisions i ve ever made this buttery crispy and gooey asiago bread one ups your childhood favorite with pesto smeared in between its slices and topped off with a warm little squishy tomato the creaminess of the white cheddar mixed in with the smokiness of the tomato make this vegetarian sandwich taste as rich as if you re eating bacon dunk it in the tangy tomato bisque and take a big bite of prep s garlicky herby roasted potatoes and just sit there taking all of the goodness in their website isn t kidding the best breakfast brunch in tucson az come hungry seriously
4185,bellagio has proven time and time again to be the hands down best pizza joint in nashville prices amazing food astounding service extraordinary great hours outdoor seating speedy delivery and lovely people i recommend the spinach artichoke pizza italian stromboli and the fried mushrooms
4186,we would frequent the 37th and market street location in philadelphia we their food during our last visit i felt compelled to report to a manager some less than hygienic habits of the chef visible to the patrons upon scheduling to visit not long after i noticed they earned an f rating we were all so disappointed because we loved this place but refuse to eat in any philadelphia eatery that rates less than a b i pray they cleaned up their act because that pickled flounder soup is calling my name
4187,this place exceeded our expectations for a simple cafe do their build your own omelette with crab meat sausage and cheeses with a side of grits with a very reasonable price highly recommended for breakfast lunch
4188,sigh i have a love affair with the egg salad and pickles soup combo just thinking about it makes my mouth water
4189,such incredible service traveling through town for business and my only complaint is i discovered this cafe on my last day visit this place and try it all food made with such love dedication and by very health conscious people a true hidden gem best gluten free pancakes you could ever have juice so fresh the aroma of freshly ground fruits dance in the air hardy meals that are made msg free and as organic as possible every town should have a basimo cafe
4190,i ve only been here once but liked it four of us shared the pretzels with beer cheese deeeelicious and a flatbread we liked both options the beer selection on draft and to take home is much bigger than you d expect for a small place pretty chill atmosphere with a few tables and decent amount of bar seating you probably couldn t bring a huge group here but it s good for a small group of friend for a chill evening beer prices not bad but definitely double check to see the size of drink you re getting
4191,regional chain that does breakfast and lunch right the kids love the french toast and i omelettes and i am a big fan of their lunch chicken soup is phenomenal solid sandwiches nothing too crazy or complicated good service and even better food
4192,jethan was really sweet and was super friendly great customer service and you can tell he cares i love seeing young people with such great attitudes
4193,today was our first visit my husband tried two different varieties of cold brew and enjoyed each i had the mango iced tea and the blueberry rooibos both were flavorful and a nice size we also tried the peanut butter balls which are incredible the service was friendly and fast and the cafe had plenty of comfortable seating i really enjoyed the atmosphere and look forward to coming back i ve never seen any cafe with as many cold brew coffee varieties
4194,came here at the recommendation of one of the mechanics at mike s dealer alternative across the street cute little place fast service and the bagel was sooo good soft yet crispy too does that make sense i got the bacon egg cheese on an everything bagel the only thing i didn t particularly care for was that the egg seemed like a frozen reheat thing but it wasn t enough to ruin me amyway i was there waiting for my car to get fixed across the street so i asked if it would be ok and the lady behind the counter was more than gracious and said that i could make myself at home so i sat and enjoyed the coffee which i thought was delicious and waited such a relief bc it was a rainy day if i m in the area during lunch i will definitely try the cuban sandwhich that people have been mentioning
4195,took my husband here on his birthday the food although good was skimpy on the portions my husband had the salmon which was small and undercooked i had the pasta with lobster and again the portion was small the cheese board was overpriced for what we got i have had much larger cheese boards with more accompaniments and less pricey for what i paid i thought the portions could have been larger the dessert menu was very limited the service was impeccable and i like that it was a byob don t think that i would return
4196,i m a huge fan of handlebar particularly for the thursday night races where participants race ridiculous custom bikes inside the bar for prizes they have a solid beer selection and free popcorn dogs are allowed they also have a lot of different board games for patrons to play there is seating both indoors and outdoors sometimes there are food trucks and or collaborations with local breweries as well what s not to like if you re in to bikes or you re simply looking for a unique bar handlebar is a solid bet
4197,good food but a little rough on service i didn t get drinks we ordered before dinner and we pointed that out by the time we were finished eating this was new years eve will try again
4198,they have been absolutely amazing and so easy to deal with call sierra air fixed my air conditioning and was exact on the pricing unlike another big company in town
4199,cool little coffee tea spot in ybor to take your lunch break plenty of seating and a couple spots outside as well atmosphere is your typical hipster like coffee shop and the tea was really good got a croissant that was pretty hard and i ended up throwing it away but all in all definitely recommend the beverages
4200,absolutely love this place very great service had the pleasure to meet the kindest woman ever raven she knows great places to go to while visiting new orleans and can make a mean drink had amazing fried oyster deviled eggs they are so freaking good with a spiked lemonade hope anyone that comes here gets to meet sweet raven
4201,great atmosphere very clean and very friendly staff the food is awesome i had the crispy buffalo chicken sandwich with tator tots loved it the beer selection is great too and the staff is very helpful for choosing a flight of beer will definitely be back here love the relaxed outdoor eating area very enjoyable
4202,food was great i visited with my mother and sister and we all got omelettes different ones they loved the grits i got a green juice and made some adjustments to reduce the sugar content the server was very sweet and accommodating all of my coworkers spoke highly of this place and they weren t wrong,chargrilled oysters were everything i also had the cajun red fish they don t have many healthy options only green beans that looked like edemame i m allergic to soy so i didn t take that chance still overall the food was great and staff was nice
4203,the chicken and waffles is a great brunch option decent wine selection get the crispy potatoes over the fries
4204,good portions a bit disappointed with how the meats are held prior to serving while undoubtedly smoked from scratch the pulled pork was held in liquid and served sopping wet brisket was fatty and left behind a good sized puddle of fat on the plate these detracted from the taste of both meats the sides were quite delicious not my go to bbq but definitely a repeat is warranted
4205,the food was pretty good and the staff was friendly it was a good family friendly place to watch the basketball game on the large screen tvs the food is kind of slow coming out it took 45 minutes for a deep dish pizza but it was made fresh and the waitress did warn us about the cook time so if you have time good place to eat
4206,i have gone to this museum many times as a child and once as an adult this museum is so hands on i love how interactive it is for the kids since it is a children s museum the target audience is obviously more for kids than adults but it was still fun to go there as an adult there were many neat facts i learned about while i was there the museum is a good size with i think three floors they do have elevators for those who need them there is a parking garage across the street and the prices are fairly standard for a museum
4207,great place excellent food waitresses are excellent very nice and so welcoming the salad it s only lettuce maybe needs tomatoes and other vegetables stick with the soup
4208,coffee wasn t up to par food was slow to come out and it s a wednesday it s not that crowded service so so young waitresses you can tell there not experienced food is always good food was cold this time had a breakfast skillet gone to stop coming here
4209,this place is delicious brought my 10 year old who said dad i m literally crying right now this restaurant is so good i don t even eat vegetables and i ate everything
4210,honestly if you re looking for amazing food great staff and a fantastic ambiance come to luke i cannot tell you how amazing chi girl i hope that s how you spell it was she took great care of us and treated us like royalty for my dad s birthday when we started chatting with her about being in from out of town she offered to give us a list of personal favorites and went over each with us above and beyond y all you will not be disappointed when you come to luke
4211,this is a great place to find foods of taiwan in reno it is great that is near casino food is tasty both to my taiwanese wife and her caucasian husband
4212,my girlfriends and i came here for a nice girls dinner we love sushi my friend had heard that it got good reviews so we decided to try it out we are so glad that we did the space is really neat it has an inviting laid back retro atmosphere i felt like i spent the first few minutes just taking in the scenery they did an excellent job with the decor we were seated immediately and our server promptly offered us water and drink menus she was awesome we ordered edamame and the chicken shrimp dumplings both were very good we ordered 6 rolls each came with at least 8 pieces regardless of it being a special or house roll we got 2 spicy salmon yellowtail scallion spider dragon and the old city they were all very good highly recommend even the platters that the food was served on were well thought through a manager came over to our table to ask us how our experience was i appreciated that touch and will definitely recommend tuna bar to people
4213,very good food today i got the pick 2 special green goddess club and turkey avocado blt yummy
4214,jasmine thai has portion control sized dishes in other words they serve you how much you should really eat in a meal most thai restaurants usually serve bigger sized dishes this is not a bad thing just wished i had a little more it took awhile for someone to get our order but once our order was in the food came out in 5 minutes their menu is not very big unfortunately they did not have any kid friendly dishes so our little one did not eat until after we left i don t expect them to have mac n cheese obviously but you could easily fry some chicken pieces strips in tempura or something the bathrooms are clean and the hand carved table tops at the booths were beautiful our waitress was super nice
4215,i got a pedicure for the first time today at cured and this place is a 10 10 in my book shon my nail tech did an amazing job and i will for sure be back soon
4216,great breakfast spot and we went during the week so it was not crowded at all let me tell you the grits if you like grits to die for i would go back just for the grits i had eggs pancakes and sausage which were all good the pancakes could have been brought out sooner but that s just me being picky i prefer my food brought out piping hot did i mention the grits were great
4217,the gooey cake is to die for definitely worth a trip the original pizza is amazing as well nice staff and great service
4218,i love the warson woods location but this not the same service was slooow the sushi roll was rolled loose and it feel apart it is trying to be too fancy and is not focused on the sushi basics just good sushi in a fun comfortable place the interior is very lovely the service was just ok i might try again since i like the other locations,everything is wonderful at the tavern the service is outstanding the seafood choices are plentiful the skillet bread is so so good i love the portion size just right the chocolate chip cookie skillet dessert is super super delicious we have gone on a sunday night a few times a it s semi quiet and it s a delightful sunday meal
4219,we ate here during the festival i had the brisket and mashed potatoes while my wife had a grilled cheese and french fries both were very good and we d eat here again
4220,we went there last weekend basically we wanted to try something new so we just searched the area for high rated places and this place was one of them when we went there for a friday it was pretty quite i m not sure how a high rated place can be quite on a friday but i have to assume they may get most of the customers for lunch the guy who greeted us and took our order was nice and polite and asked us have we ever been there he explained everything and we picked pulled pork the meat was ok however there was nothing special about it the sides were cold and probably left over from lunch and to be honest not a very satisfying experience the atmosphere was ok signs were hand written on paper attached to the wall i liked the sitting area and the windows
4221,it s a diner which is exactly what you want for a good big breakfast before a long day seems to be where a lot of locals go which is where i like to be great prices for a downtown restaurant
4222,in town for the weekend for a soccer tournament and was looking for a good breakfast place and stumbled across this place my son ordered one of the platters with chocolate chip pancakes scrambled eggs and two meats bacon and sausage i ordered the eggs benedict which came with hashbrowns first let me start off with the place was packed the parking lot was full the restaurant crowded yet we were sat right away and the waitress was very prompt in greeting us and getting our drink order in fact she was one of the best servers i ve had in a while she paid attention to when our drinks started to get low i had hot tea and she got me more hot water before i had to ask and checked on us just enough times my eggs benedict was great the hashbrowns could have been seasoned but ham was flavorful it tastes like it had been grilled on an open grill and the hollandaise sauce was plentiful i tasted the chocolate chip pancakes and they were fluffy and sweet without tasting like a candy bar the only bad part of this review is that a teenager in line to pay with her family we were seated near the register had the music on her phone extremely loud and the owner manager came up to my teenage son and asked him to turn it down my son politely told him it wasn t him and the owner immediate apologized and we all laughed it off we came back same day for dinner my son got the cajun burger we got waffle fries with cheese and ranch and i got the open faced hot turkey sandwich with stuffing and mashed potatoes my son inhaled the burger so i m assuming it was good the fires were tasty and you could tell they were homemade the ranch wasn t my favorite but i m a fan of hidden valley so that s more of a personal preference thing the bread on my sandwich was slightly sweet but tastes great with the stuffing the gravy needed a little bit more flavor but i am partial to my moms turkey gravy so i cannot fault the diner the only issue is that there was paper in my sandwich it appears the cooks missed removing the paper from the meat slices that was discouraging because we had such a great experience for breakfast the waitress did give us our dessert on the house which i appreciated i would still come back here next time we are in town my
4223,awesome customer service very helpful love the location and how u can just pull right up to ur unit prices were good and u can do all ur stuff online the rates online are the best
4224,great food and great selection it s one of our regular spots i love that their menu has a vietnamese chinese and japanese options every time we eat here the food is always yummy
4225,great experience aly was our server and was so nice and courteous we had ceviche del da and the empanadas de hongos delicious the ceviche is on the spicy side but lots of shrimp also the pollo iron skillet tacos were awesome as was the rancheros style enchiladas costilla braised short rib will definitely be back
4226,had a phenomenal time cuba gabriel and mattie are the best that s bartenders in florida belly up very hospitable and wonderful drinks constant helping out it s a must to go here nightly specials
4227,only waited about 5 minutes on a saturday night for a table for 4 of us generous warm bread bowl to start byob large selection of italian favorites at our table we had the lasagna gnocchi meatballs and chicken parm and garlic chicken with sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms everything was fabulous and we all took leftovers home only mediocre item was the meatballs we also sampled a really decadent chocolate candy bar cake from the dessert tray highly recommend to anyone in the area
4228,the ambiance is pleasant welcoming and clean sabrina s is a stylized balanced blend of modern and eclectic decor the service is timely and inviting hands down a must stop for delicious food on any road trip or just a hungry night out definitely meets up to the 5 star rating
4229,we finally had the opportunity to try katie s and now i kick myself that i waited this long the food was fantastic its seriously the closest thing to the pizza and pasta we had in rome last year i very much enjoyed my ted s meatball pizza and my husband devoured his spaghetti and meatballs i think its safe to say that we now have an obsession with the meatballs here in addition to our delicious food we were able to enjoy it on their outside patio love with live music playing in the background the atmosphere was chill and entertaining and the house wine took the edge off from the work week i seriously cannot wait to go back and try another pizza and maybe some meatballs on the side
4230,we went to burger up for the first time recently during a trip to nashville i ordered a burger with sweet potato fries the burger was pretty good but the fries were cold not warm at all i would have sent them back but the wait itself for the food was a bit much didn t want to wait longer for warm fries my husband asked for ketchup for his fries but the waiter forgot it my husband liked his burger
4231,great little restaurant right on the corner of jackson square i ate dinner here my first night in nola and the big fat barbecue shrimp hit the spot the doors and windows were all open letting the warm air flow through a perfect spot for a late winter meal
4232,i found this place through yelp i was attracted because of the 4 star rating it was right down the street from where i was staying so i ended up walking i walked right in with no appointment and was taken immediately the gentleman who did my nails was extremely nice and worked very precisely we also had a few laughs too he did amazing work and i also think it was the fastest mani i have ever gotten he also did a light hand massage at the end i got gel and it was 25 which i thought was reasonable i will definitely go back when i m back in the area highly recommend it is a spacious salon with many mani and pedi stations
4233,francesca is very nice and helpful she also travels with her dog who s very cute i ended up meeting her at civil life brewery the van she works in is a lot more equipped than i had ever imagined i just had some brakes installed and a handlebar alteration and it took less than 30 minutes i think i met her at the end of her shift since the brewery was so close to her storage unit i had a beer while i waited i was very happy with her service i will definitely be doing business with francesca again
4234,my husband and i were out of town for labor day weekend when our car had an engine check light and a couple of other warning lights appear tod in service had our car checked and confirmed nothing major just dirt on a sensor he sent us off without any charge after figuring i was going to pay at least 150 for a diagnosis wow were we pleasantly surprised and denver and inri kept me company while looking at rav4s while the service was being performed what a great crew i d recommend them to anyone
4235,everything is good here hot italian sandwich is my favorite i get all the regular italian food pasta ravioli lasagna chicken parmigiana and pizza so good the only downside is a large crowd at lunch time
4236,was really in the mood for a smoothie bowl and so glad i found this place it was delicious definitely will be one of my new go tos
4237,sport cycle pacific maintenance my ninja they have done several upgrades for me all resulting in me being 100 satisfied their rates are competitive and they are a good group to deal with
4238,from the atmosphere to the service and the food m3 does not disappoint the mascarpone polenta is soo good and the stuffed risotto balls with tomato cream sauce will have you thinking about them days after your meal food is good quality and flavorful highly recommend
4239,this is a great place to go for crab lobster as locals we ve come many times over the years first the clam chowder is the best i ve ever had and the bisque is also great stay away from the crab cakes unless you like a gluten type cake also as much as i love abalone this is not the place to order it why they don t just pound it and fry it in pepper salt flour is unknown all the tacos are excellent cole slaw and onion rings are awesome plan on spending 100 plus for 2 if you have drinks and a shellfish dinner worth it
4240,a few weeks ago we brought our puppy but he wasn t able to be groomed which is understandable we picked him up and were charged 45 00 for a puppy cut today we decided to try another groomer and again our puppy still wasn t ready for a full cut which is still understandable so he got a puppy cut but we were only charged 20 00 the lady said that because a puppy cut doesn t take near the time she doesn t charge full price jose and marcela are very nice and i m sure they do good work but they shouldn t charge full price if the puppy isn t ready for a full cut which they weren t able to do anyway
4241,the food at this location is wonderful also enjoy thai iced coffee or iced tea not sure how they make it but it s great,great service and really cool event space we had a wonderful time at the art show so many very talented people
4242,we used the master s baker for our wedding cake last week hope was our consultant and she was so sweet and helpful the cake was so pretty even more important it was delicious we had two flavors lemon and carrot cake so good definitely recommend
4243,great atmosphere great music excellent food one thing i will state is that this is not the place to come for fast service everyone works in relax no rush mode but this is a great place if you looking have great food and simply look t relax and enjoy your surroundings
4244,this place was busy loud and food was great i had the half rack baby back ribs stuffing and baked potato the ribs were amazing bridgeport rib house is not fancy and worth any wait
4245,i am not known for favorable restaurant reviews most of them below my radar the love is different we had a father s day lunch that was exceptional there is little left off the menu and we were hard pressed to make a choice from the wonderful selections listed our waiter was professional and accommodating lovely atmosphere light and bright i was amazed that the inside of my omelet was hot a little surprise thrown in with my potatos roasted peppers and onions greens on every plate mine had warm spinach salad as well my husband had the belgium waffles made with corn meal and garnished with blueberry butter they use our favorite la columbe coffee nothing left to wish for
4246,on our way home to indiana stopped here for lunch as always at cracker barrel the menu had many choices including healthy options the service was efficient and friendly it took only 3 minutes for the salad to come out and 7 minutes later our food was out food was hot and tasted excellent refills for drinks were frequent with the waiter being attentive but not hovering the bill was ready as soon as we were done eating with the waiter even offering to provide us beverages to go restrooms as well as other facilities were very clean
4247,love this place excellent food and excellent customer service the specialty rolls are absurd and the sushi burritos are awesome
4248,amazing owner and great place my order was wrong but the issue was addressed quickly and politely i would definitely be back
4249,fabulous lunch on a quaint little patio dog friendly place unique sandwiches and salads they brought the dogs water and bacon bits i would definitely return
4250,the bar and staff are amazing we got a room upgrade for have been being on our honeymoon and the view was gorgeous but the room was not any better than a hilton it had rust in the tub floor and some weird stains on the tile but this was only in the bathroom so i give it 4 stars great staff but too much for valet so we parked a couple streets down that was the only other con i would say would recommend if you want to be literally in the working downtown area of st louis lots of cool bars and restaurants on a friday night
4251,excellent coffee great ambience and friendly staff oh and did i mention the macaroon was absolutely to die for great way to spend a weekend morning
4252,real nice place good environment i have dealt with other places that just seem like you are bothering them by asking questions both this place the other day i was helped out by a worker with red hair and he was very insightful on the products i was looking to start building but had nothing to get started with so instead of letting me jump into a deep end and drown he showed me this ijoy srda the man knew it inside and out and helped me hook it up i know if i went to another store asking questions about something i knew very little about they would have treated me like an a h0 e i can t say it enough these guys know what they are doing and if you have questions the employees will waive you answers without being condescending hands down great place as i said i just got the ijoy srda i have never built anything and don t know how but this top gives me the next best thing even cost less than what i was looking for so you know the people there ain t going to sell you anything to make a sale
4253,muriel s is clearly a step above others in new orleans the location is great customer service is outstanding and the food the steak and red fish superb was the best we have eaten while in nola while there you must ask for a tour of the upstairs if there is t a private party they may allow you to visit alone do t visit nola without a stop at muriel s you will be greatly disappointed great work team we will return every time we visit nola
4254,umm yes if you have a sweet tooth you have to take a trip to mike s there are so many ice creams to choose from i had the butter pecan which was creamy buttery and full of nuts despite what the menu says waffle cones are not 95 cents my boyfriend and i read the menu wrong and thought 95 cents for a huge cone was a steal and it would have been if that were true great ice cream
4255,their food tastes very authentic and good definitely try their soups because they will warm your soul on a cold rainy day which is prevalent here in indy when it is summer their bubble teas are delicious and a great way to cool down
4256,rj and i attended love lies and taxidermy on feb 17 what a great production we had front row seats and enjoyed the show very much there were only 3 actors and they went on for 90 minutes with no breaks i don t know how it is possible to memorize all those lines they are truly talented i really enjoyed the intimate setting and you can t go wrong with theater in the round this was a great little play
4257,yummy breakfast the hash browns are great i got them well done super inexpensive as well definitely get the pancakes and they also have outdoor seating which is a plus i would give 5 starts for a better table layout it got really crammed
4258,i am a numbskull and accidentally reserved a room for the night before i actually needed the room i learned this upon getting to the hotel they not only found a way to accommodate me they voided the charge on the night i didn t actually stay here and gave me the same room rate for the night i needed the room excellent customer service and commitment to customer retention it s nice to know loyalty still means something property is clean and pretty up to date ample parking starbucks a block away and plenty of restaurants nearby
4259,loved it here been meaning to come here for awhile the bartender whose name i forgot to ask was amazing literally the only save after my experience downstairs and the only reason i ll ever eat at felipe s again we spent several hours here and had half a dozen drinks and some shots and gummies we only left because if we stayed we were going to spend another hundred bucks honestly will come back but 75 of the reason to see the bartender again a year later wow what happened to you guys you guys updated the menu again by removing more items it didn t exactly speed up the service the best thing about the place is michael which was the only reason we came back and to our dismay got stuck in a booth not that it mattered he was so overworked and understaffed he wouldn t have been chatty and witty anyway another guy was there red shirt middle aged clearly worked there i use that term loosely he was only interested in other tables literally every single other table besides ours until we ordered a 40 drink then we warranted passing attention shame it took thirty minutes to get that drink and another fifteen for the second and final drink seriously get more staff i ll probably be back but i ll call ahead to see who s working and if there s not room at the bar i ll just go to lucy s on tchoupitoulas they not only have great bartenders but they have the support staff necessary to run a bar michael if you quit and go somewhere else let us know we ll follow you anywhere even to the saint

4263,great place for happy hour oysters the gumbo was delicious and they kept the drinks flowing service was impeccable and the servers are very polite and friendly i wish they would expand to other states
4264,this is probably one of my favorite burgers i ve had in a while i m not a terribly into burgers so that s saying something i got the 4 cheese garlic burger with a side of mac and cheese both delicious the buns are definitely one of the best parts of the burger my boyfriend got the 96 with a side of fries and loved it the only thing i would say is that the patties are very thick so if you re a thin burger lover this isn t for you to finish i got the abc milkshake amazing you can see my reaction in the photo overall delicious and will be back again
4265,great company melanie has made our time as home owners turned landlords incredibly easy we are going on our second year using synergy and melanie as our property managers and would recommend them to friends and family thanks matt

4269,super cute chic nail salon the products are all natural and smell wonderful the staff is super friendly professional knowledgeable and do an excellent job will definitely return
4270,i have trusted maggie and her seamstresses to tailor many garments from gap jeans to delicate silk chinese dresses to a tory burch trench coat they ve always done an amazing professional job and it s always ready by the time they say it will be i recommend her all the time to friends and family and they ve all had great luck with her
4271,we enjoyed eating downstairs in the open area lakeside with a light breeze and lovely views everything and everyone working here is still relatively or brand new so there are some glitches to be overcome friendly affordable and comfortable enjoy felix s open air
4272,i love love love their tacos my parent don t stay too far from it so i try to get some whenever i am craving tacos which is almost 3 days a week it is cash only i have not tried anything other than the tacos
4273,i had the chicken salad sandwich the other day with an ice cold stella and it was beautiful creation of beauty owner comes out and talks with you super nice and cool
4274,brandon aimee were so polite and let me try different daiquiris omg the concoction they created for me was the bomb
4275,every time we can t think of somewhere to go we choose livery from their stunning rooftop patio atmosphere to their semi private upstairs bar to their spicy cocktails and fun south american inspired menu livery never disappoints we always have great service and leave ready to come back again ps their valet is super reasonable and makes attending events at the murat a breeze
4276,great customer service and quality found my new jewlery place i originally came in for sizing but their jeweler was completely honest and said that if i sized it now i risk it being too tight in the summer so i just had it cleaned which the jeweler put a rush pick up in 3 hrs on it since i lived far away i appreciate the honesty and commitment to good service
4277,as a newyorker i d have to say some of the best pizza i ever have deffintly top 5 be prepared to wait as it s made fresh
4278,my best friend and i were originally on a waitlist for a different breakfast place but wanted to get coffee somewhere this place was the closest and i m so glad we went because we ended up not going back to that other place the ambience is pretty cool being it was an old church but inside its modern and fresh the lattes we ordered were amazing my only gripe was it took a bit long to get our breakfast but for us it wasn t too big of deal since we had lots of conversation i would definitely come back to this place
4279,excellent oysters both char grilled and raw are top notch char grilled oysters are fully cooked with bay seasoning and cheese and served with a side of garlic butter great taste but a tad gritty possibly due to the bay seasoning if you like raw oysters like myself you will really enjoy the raw variety i ordered a full dozen oysters to myself one rainy evening and did not feel awkward with everyone watching they were a good size and taste creamy with an fresh ocean explosion in your mouth the fish are fresh and taste as so i had my first hush puppies here and i am a fan
4280,han dynasty is the besttt definitely deserves its high rating on yelp first off i love the interior decor it s a very chill vibe you can definitely see that han dynasty took the time to brand itself it s not just another chinese restaurant mad props also they were playing bloom by odesza at some point so that s another ten bonus points to them haha came here with a group of six people we wanted more space since chinese meals are usually to be shared and circular tables are preferred unfortunately the circular tables were reserved but they were accommodating enough and put two rectangular tables together for us i say accommodating enough because i feel like one of the waitresses was lowkey judging us anyway when it came time to order my parents tried to speak chinese to the waiter but he didn t understand chinese so i ended up trying to translate all the chinese items into english this was kind of annoying so if you want to order in chinese just be aware that some of the waiters don t speak chinese for me it was fine though because i m a total abc and prefer to speak in english lol so anyway on to the food food was spicy spicy but good we ordered a bunch of stuff but barely made a dent in most of them amirite that said it really was great food without further ado here s what we ordered dumplings in chili oil this was hella spicy so i didn t eat much it was alright not amazing i wouldn t order again eggplant w garlic sauce this was pretty good a bit more solid than i would have liked though i m used to more mushy eggplant so i can mix it with my rice is that me being weird or is that a legit preference i have no idea but yeah overall good taste would order again cumin style lamb this was yummy the lamb was tender it was really spicy though so if you can t handle spice very well do not order this i was spiced out while eating this the flavor was good though i probably wouldn t order this again though because too spicy for me dry fry fish omg this made the meal i freaking loved this stuff if i didn t have such a low tolerance for spicy stuff i would ve eaten the whole dish it s spicy but it also has this subtly sweet undertone you don t expect that when you look at it but when you taste it it s such a nice surprise i m in love with this fish and i d go back to han dynasty just to taste this dish again oh also i forgot to mention that we came in around 1pm and it wasn t crowded at all more people did come in at 2pm also i think the service could ve been a little better i was spiced out and i wish they had filled my water more overall this place was awesome chill vibes authentic sichuan chinese food will definitely be back
4281,all i have to say is amazing i am always up to try new things especially food i am a transitioning vegetarian and this place was an awesome way to start i was with a group so i cannot comment on seating times since our group sprinkled in over a few minutes our server was on point she refilled water glasses very quickly never had to ask our group shared a vegan platter i cant remember the name the platter was outstanding i wish i could remember everything on the platter i will just say the lentils which i have never had and the spinach were by far my favorites everything was so good oh i cannot forget to talk about the cabbage sambusa my granddaughter loved them and i did too i wish the location was closer to my home i would eat there every week lastly the warm baklava mmmmmm good i think i have worked up an appetite
4282,east indian food is hard to come by this place was cute great prices and fresh the owner was very nice and attentive would highly recommend
4283,as a yankee fan i must say the staduim is one of the better ones ive been to it is pleasent to watch a game here also very convenient the train station is right there as well
4284,very nice atmosphere valet parking a little pricey for meals but there is a sunset menu 4 30 to 5 30 i believe we started with a drink at the bar we were not told it was happy hour i was charged 4 more for a drink at the bar than at the table i should have questioned but didn t a glass of wine was 2 less at the bar we started with 6 oysters 6 shrimp cocktail best oysters ever mixed grilled seafood with vegetables ny strip mashed salad 1 dessert it was my birthday and they suprised me with creme brulee 1 drink each 125 waitress was very attentive
4285,great little upscale but not overpriced cafe lots of options but needs a lox bagel sandwich one of my preferred places to lunch with someone
4286,love this place burgers are delicious the fries are fresh sundaes and concrete mixers are ways to satisfy that sweet tooth
4287,brandon was fantastic we came in with a large group and he was polite friendly and fun we had several individuals with food allergies and he was extremely knowledgeable and accommodating will definitely be back again soon
4288,freshest and most well thought out sushi we got the tasting menu and were pleasantly surprised by every course
4289,food is great no complaints with 6 customers pancakes are awesome breakfast burrito was amazing omelets were good nashville got chicken sandwich was good and the burger was good as well no bad options from what we ordered service is great as well
4290,went there for lunch a few days ago with 18 other guys not only were the ribs some of the best fall off the bone ribs i ve ever had they were very reasonably priced we had a great waitress who handled all 19 of our food and drink orders and nobody had to wait for a refill on their drink one side note the place had various sizes of pig statues in all the windows i asked our waitress if the owner would consider selling me a small one she sent the owner over who asked me why in the world i wanted it i told her my wife collects them and i thought she would like that one she walked over picked it up and brought it to me i told her i wanted to buy it but she insisted i take it at no charge that s not the reason for the 5 star rating those ribs are that darned good
4291,this custard was amazing i had high hopes based on the number of people in line waiting and they delivered i expected a long wait for my order but i waited no more than 5 minutes i ordered the cookie dough concrete custard in the micro size and it was extremely filling best cookie dough version of any dessert i ve ever had i wish these stands were closer to my home town because it would be a regular indulgence the menu had lots of options it was the perfect way to end my night
4292,love this place the staff is nice and friendly my children and i love coming here to paint
4293,i am so addicted to this restaurant i was trepidatious about trying them because of their location being the old carrows boy am i thrilled that i tried it or maybe not because now i crave it there is literally nothing to order that will disappoint everything from the ingredients to the execution and presentation is stellar not to mention the friendly staff and atmosphere i may have gained a few pounds as a result of my love for their food but i m not sorry i didn t want to wear a bikini anyway worthit
4294,i am now back home in las vegas but i am still thinking about those nola shrimp and grits loved this place i got the jambalaya shrimp and jalapeo grits and the spiced shrimp and everything was very delicious didn t catch her name but the lady in the front was very nice and had a lot of patience with me when i was asking questions about the food haha i went back the next day to check out the other venues
4295,these are the best donuts in philly and quite possibly among the best in the country what makes them so mouth watering delicious is they make the sugar cake donuts to order so they are warm light and airy with a crispy sugary outside our favorite is the cinnamon sugar haven t tried the fried chicken yet but plan to soon since we live just a short walk away
4296,we were very excited to try this place as we love bailey s chocolate bar and rooster parking around the area proved to be very difficult when we got there it wasn t busy we could sit at a long communal table or at the bar we were not aware of that arrangement prior to going and opted for the bar the place was clean and had a hipster feel to it playing techno music and interesting staff however we were there for the love of burgers by appearances they looked amazing everything was fresh and house made sauces the house cheese sauce was good on the fries but if it was the same on the burger it just was very blah with no flavor the burgers however were also lacking in flavor maybe they needed to be seasoned everything was very bland and lacked flavor even with the array of neat toppings and sauces hubby loved the onion rings though also our waiter waitress situation was weird we had two different people who said they were our waiter but both disappeared one got our drinks another our food order and then the other checked us out weren t checked on or offered refills were very disappointed with wait staff and lack of service we were very disappointed with bailey s range and won t be returning
4297,i love malvern grooms and take my dogs there regularly for haircuts teeth and ear cleaning and nail clipping love the photos that they take once the dogs are all done
4298,if you want a great sandwich something uncommonly good try a barrio sandwich the custom barrio bread makes an unbelievable good sandwich coupled with quality ingredients unparalleled in tucson really you can tell the chef put real care into the product being served because it s not just any sandwich i had the cubano that i would recommend to anyone but my friend had the focaccia chicken pesto and raved about it great experience fast personal service check it out
4299,the number one rule of the smoke truck is you don t piss off the chef the number two rule of the smoke truck is you don t piss off the chef yes being a part of this food truck secret is just as good as being in fight club i would even argue that it s better this food truck is hands down the best bang for buck food truck in the city the chef is an awesome man who is extremely particular about the quality of his ingredients he truly treats cooking and his food as art to repeat he treats his food as art meaning he is just as particular as some artists you may know therefore i advise that you not aggravate him by attempting to tailor your order in any way just wait in line pay your 10 dollars say thank you and grab your food things to note bring your own silverware you pay with 10 cash there is a limit of one plate per person this is an approximation but wait time is 3 5 minutes per person in line so the food every single food group is included in your menu the chicken is charcoal cooked to perfection then overlaid with a ginger squash sauce that has a little bit of kick to it the chef makes his own noodles and piles them on top of that a green vegetable is then added to round out the flavor and the meal is topped off with grapes utter perfection please enjoy
4300,this is my go to for fresh fast and healthy i ve never had anything from freshii that i didn t like and i ve tried pretty much everything that has a vegetarian option it is a little expensive but worth the extra couple of dollars to eat healthy whatever you do get the goji peanut butter coconut balls amazing
4301,totally cool place awesome environment the arcade and pinball machines were in great condition and really fun to play there was nothing oldy and moldy about it just super fun i really like all of the people that were there lively and refreshing
4302,my overall experience with cactus was mostly okay it s a great environment for catching up with friends over drinks for a couple of hours to start they give you an ample amount of chips and salsa the salsa itself had a nice bite to it i personally love spicier foods so if spice isn t your thing take it easy for food i ordered the chorizo pub burger which was outstanding the chorizo patty was nice and crispy on the outside with a nice juicy center our server was also very sweet and attentive my only issue with this place was the bartender that was working the ratio of margarita mix to tequila was very inconsistent with a taste equivalent to overly sweetened lemonade with barely any alcohol when we kindly requested the bartender add an additional shot we even stated we were willing to pay extra if we had to he gave us a sour attitude about it and proceeded to talk about us to his coworker to me that just shows poor customer service skills word of advice if you re going to complain about customers do it out of earshot next time if there s a different bartender next time around i might feel inclined to return because the food was decent
4303,went here for a weekday lunch did two ala cartes and two all you can eats all the rolls were fresh and tasted marvelous recommend
4304,we had a really good experience with northeast auto they were able to get us taken care of the day we stopped in and they were fast and efficient the mechanics were really nice and informative i d definitely go there again if i have car trouble
4305,been twice and i have no complaints food is always great especially the tavern burger and great beer on tap this place will not disappoint the service is even better great music box too with all the updated music if you go ask for aubree
4306,a group of four came in after a visit to the rotating display at the sellersville museum it was mr peanut and planters well worth a stop next time you are close but that s a different review on to the horse we started with beverages three local beers and a cocktail a dish of steamers in white sauce and the homemade beer battered pickles tasty only two of the steamers hadn t opened although we could have used crunchy bread to sop up the garlicky buttery juice pickles sliced twice the size of commercial pickles were just on the edge of too big but never fell over lightly battered a bit salty quite yummy three of the party all had the cuban sandwiches melted cheese oozing again with those snappy pickles the sandwich was good love to bite through the crispy crust i had the burger just to compare their bacon jam to mine and i was pleasantly surprised to have the flavor texture be right there juicy patty the jam made a wonderful counterpoint to be buttery bun that caught all the meaty goodness we come up once a year and we ll definitely be back our waitress was very nice sorry forgot her name
4307,don t miss this hidden gem in a nondescript strip mall the food is fabulous and the veggie crepe is healthy to boot i felt great for the rest of the morning after starting off the day here
4308,let me start off by saying we are not big drinkers so a night out for us consist of two to three drinks and we start to feel a good buzz so it s our first time to nashville we head straight to broadway on saturday night want to get a good buzz going and enjoy the atmosphere and town the place is beautiful very modern sat in the second level bar had the buckshot and 2 jack and cokes to follow all i have to say is super weak drinks paid about 75 and felt like we drank water
4309,we were in indianapolis on a business trip for the week and found this place in yelp best place in indianapolis we have strict dietary restrictions due to health reasons crohns so finding a place to eat out is always a bit of a challenge this was the first place where we took nearly 20 min to decide what we wanted to eat so many options for us and the food was incredible the paleo pizza crust made us not even miss regular pizza crust and the kombucha cocktails were so refreshing plus the service was top notch definitely coming back here when we are here for business again
4310,a little hole in the wall that really puts out a great product i don t really have any complaints the food is good the service is good i got the mango chicken al pastor and mole all of them were great especially with the house sauces

4312,cafe ponte is a delightful alternative to lunch for the area it s upscale modern and really takes an inventive and edgy twist to their menu you can tell a lot of tlc goes into creating a innovative menu that stands out from the rest and taste delicious to boot now i ve only gone for lunch but it s always packed with groups of business professionals making it a great place for a work meeting or client meeting in an otherwise lacking industrial area i met my girlfriend for lunch and even though the patio and outside seating looked so enticing the storm clouds were looming in the distance inside it has s bustling modern feel open kitchen so you an see the freshness and stocked with a full bar i do feel it necessary to mention that they do close at 2 so plan to go earlier for lunch but they re open for dinner around 5 30 their service is definitely not short of 5 stars our waiter was prompt precise provided great input on menu items and had a super upbeat and happy attitude he made me feel like i was happy that he worked there lol the manager was even on the floor clearing tables delivering food and chatting up the guests i got the fresh handmade goat cheese gnocchi with pistachio pesto and broccoli light fresh and delicious and the mushroom soup is a must the best soup i have probably ever had my girlfriend got the mushroom soup as well swoon and the lobster roll which was filled to be brim with huge chunks of lobster there had to be s whole lobster in it not one of those tools that s all filler and breading definitely worth the market price,freshii is an awesome place for a quick healthy meal we found this hidden gem close to our office and are so excited to have fresh delicious and healthy options for a quick lunch or even be perfect for a little meetup with friends the inside is clean and bright with the walls covered in foliage giving it a fun semi tropical kind of feel they also have outside seating w umbrella do it is pet friendly and lets us enjoy the beautiful florida sunshine now to the food there were so many options and variations is was almost impossible to choose but the helpful staff was very knowledgeable about the different dishes and helped steer me in the right direction i went with the pangoa and it was delish it was picture perfect actually brown rice topped with fresh avacado cilantro and cherry tomatoes roasted corn black beans chicken and drizzled with a tangy spicy bbq sauce not so spicy for my tastebuds i m literally craving it as i type this my friend got the cobb salad and he couldn t stop raving about it everything was fresh crisp delicious and fast also a greats option for vegans as the have tofu and falafels for all meal options they also had a huge array of smoothies a juice cleanse and breakfast options i could see this being a one stop shop for someone in the go who trying to add few more healthy options to their repertoire freshii is defiantly going to be a staple in my busy work week
4313,my boyfriend and i visited for dinner and were pleasantly surprised the menu is strictly dumplings and we went with the crab and pork mixture 8 dumplings for 12 note to everyone cash only for orders under 25 thankfully we came prepared first came out a bowl of chicken broth for each of us i tasted it and it made me worry for the dumplings the broth was quite similar to water with very little seasoning and not the greatest flavor but then the little bundles of joy came out pretty quickly i might add the lady behind the counter was extremely sweet and asked if this was our first time as we were googling the art of dumpling eating she explained the best way to go about it and said many people mix and match each dumpling with the provided soy sauce rice vinegar and chili sauce the broth within the dumpling was seasoned to perfection and our only complaint was that there wasn t more in each little dumpling pocket the dumplings themselves were divine as well packed with meat and flavor the 4 stars comes from the rather steep price for the amount of tiny sized dumplings you get we were satisfied after 1 order but definitely would have needed at least 1 more to be full
4314,my boyfriend said to me now when we get there you can t do the voice ok i m sure they hear it all the time he s talking about the raspy yat y all have heard on the radio commercials i ain t ya momma but you re always at home at dots dinah yeah you right well i ve never been and we had an excuse to go out to celebrate because eating out is a celebration no matter where you are imo so we grabbed a bite eavesdropped on the family behind us filled our bellies and observed another family also selecting dots to celebrate grandmas birthday who knew this was such a place for special occasions i d say overall value was five stars as i ve had two additional meals from my leftovers service was four hot coffee refills constant checkups and intuitive service when you communicate in sign language with the cook for a box across the dining room and food was three stars grits were lumpy gravy had skin on top hash browns lacked color overall i d go back for the atmosphere and value plus it s fun to do the voice
4315,the ribeye medium was amazing seriously so big i highly recommend splitting i couldn t even finish my half butter mushrooms were also very good not crazy about the ceaser salad but still was good overall i would recommend to try if you come to nola
4316,this is my and my husband s favorite place to get lunch the fried pork gyoza is absolutely the best i ve had around town and i get it every time the place is always clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful there s some yummy kid s options too if you re like us and have picky eaters
4317,harry s blue bell is a nice spot we stopped a few days ago for a quick dinner it s tucked in the corner of a shopping center and it s very easy to miss it was packed and seemed like the place to be for locals the inside is nice but small only a few tables in the entire place the service was just okay the beer selection is very good as are the prices on the beer the food menu was a bit limited with you re basic bar food the wife went with the bbq pulled pork and i went with the chicken and honey mustard wrap the bbq pork was good the bun was nicely toasted but the sauce was overly sweet for our liking the wrap was fresh and good but nothing spectacular the fries were hot and crispy the kale slaw was fantastic but a very small portion overall it was a decent meal i wouldn t go out of my way to go back if i were in the area i d stop though solid 3 stars,i ve been wanting to try apollo s for quite sometime we ve been in the area about 8 years and i always seem to forget about it we stopped by this past thursday for lunch we arrived around noon and it was dead just us and the waitress the place is small and it s dated but in a good way the server had been there since they started in the 70s for a pizza place to survive that long and in the same family they must be doing something right i went with a cheesesteak hoagie and the wife had their 10 pizza they are supposedly known for their cheesesteaks and they advertise 1 2 pounders i must say that i was pleasantly surprised it was very good the steak was juicy and the roll was extremely fresh there was an ample amount of meat and the sandwich was seasoned as it should be next time i would get the roll toasted the pizza was also good but different i love the cheese to sauce ratio i always prefer more cheese than sauce the cheese blend is unique and adds a nice flavor i think it s provolone and mozzarella the crust was nice and crispy but a little thick for our liking overall it was a good reasonable lunch and we would return solid 4 stars
4318,great food and comfortable atmosphere and super affordable if your looking for comfort food this is the spot
4319,a hidden little gem if you re looking for an authentic nola foodie experience come here everything we ordered was delicious waitstaff were all sweet and accommodating just straight up delicious food quality is on point

4322,i have to say when i walked into this saks 5th i was a bit let down they did not have that much variety it felt like everything was very spread out to make it look like there was more i understand that works but i was looking for a clutch and the pickings were slim i was surprised by the big gucci section so if you re looking for gucci they have a big room in the back devoted to it other than that the staff were friendly not overbearing thankfully other than that i didn t find what i was looking for and i only stayed on the floor since i only needed a bag idk i wasn t impressed by this location
4323,we are new to the area and wanted to find our go to place for great pizza well we have found it fortunatos pizza is awesome the white pizza cheese pizza is out of this world as are the salads and cannolis looking forward to tasting the many other pizzas great and friendly service seems family owned which is an added bonus

4331,the best filet i ve ever eaten perfectly cooked came to the table sizzling i ordered the scalloped potatoes which were handmade so you could really taste the difference our server anthony was outstanding as was the maitre d dark haired female the restaurant has not changed since my first visit sometime in the 80 s lots of character for those that are hesitant regarding the safety of the area there are ample security staff outside if you haven t had a meal at crescent city treat yourself you ll be glad you d
4332,in nola for mardi gras the wait was 45mins customer service was really good everyone is super nice kudos to the staff you guys rock the food it was average nothing special my french toast was crunchy not nice and fluffy like i like the french toast was lacking brown sugar cinnamon and nutmeg it came with fruit which was nice the turkey bacon wasn t crispy enough overall c prob won t be back
4333,love this place great food for a very low price staff members are friendly and helpful i had the half chicken and my friend had the ox tail everything was great
4334,i love all of the bailey s restaurants so was very excited to see the new concept in the old space the decor is absolutely beautiful it felt warm and inviting but also very modern and fun we started our meal with the crab cake and the corn dogs i was a bit surprised to see a crab cake appetizer with only one crab cake i think it would have been better to have two smaller crab cakes to make it easier to share it is an appetizer however the flavor of it was very good the corn dogs were also good but the portion size felt very off to me it was served with five corn dogs but they were almost the size of my palm this required us to use a knife to eat them so then the breading was falling off making it somewhat strange to eat i would have liked to see this served differently for our meals we both ordered the jambalaya i enjoyed the sausage and tiny shrimp in the dish and felt it added some much needed texture i found myself seeking those bites out and stopping when they were gone i was surprised at the dish it was served in it essentially came out in a boat instead of a bowl which i felt was an odd choice our server while a nice person was not very helpful in terms of recommending items on the menu for a new restaurant i wanted to hear the house recommendations or customer favorites so far they also went missing for about thirty minutes after we were served our main dishes and we had to flag someone down to get our check i really wanted to love this restaurant but it fell a little short of my expectations the food was good but not as good as i was expecting for the price and service was inconsistent i will probably give it another shot since i love the bailey s restaurants and think the new orleans inspired cuisine is something our city needs but am not in a hurry to return
4335,beautiful space and i love the thought of brunch here today i was reminded why this isn t a go to spot for us service was slow and food was mediocre we arrived on time for our reservation and ordered a cocktail immediately upon being seated then we waited twenty five minutes before receiving our first drink food took awhile as well not as long as the drinks and it was room temp when it arrived new orleans has too many good restaurants to settle for slow service and mediocre expensive food taking this one off our list
4336,i went on a sunday afternoon just to grab a beer the staff were all very friendly and the bartender was happy to share the daily specials with me i know that sounds like something that should be standard or at the very least shouldn t stand out but i can t tell you the number of times a server or bartender has been annoyed at having to relay the specials the interior was very clean and had a rustic feel with a beautiful marble fireplace and brick accent walls i was also pleasantly surprised by how clean the restrooms were it is a bar and i m sure it has a very different atmosphere on a friday or saturday night but on sunday afternoons it is very relaxed
4337,really chill vibe awesome service always feel welcome and really on point advice always walking away satisfied not just with our purchases but also with the company of the employees always so helpful for any amount of time allowing the customer to really take their time and find what they love very personal if you re looking for a new or another vape shop we suggest planet of the vapes every time special thanks to amber for being such a gem
4338,this place is great the owner is amazing and makes everyone feel like they are part of the family in addition to the wonderful owner the staff are all polite and always willing to help this place never stops smiling and you really feel at home delicious food with a menu that is culturally diverse they have a deal buster breakfast special for 3 85 mon fri 7 8 30am i am kind of picky and i have been coming here for over 5 years that should tell you i really love this place
4339,average burger for 9 came out in 30 minutes and my wife s salad hit our table 50 minutes after ordering clearly understaffed for a saturday evening they refunded a few customers luckily we weren t in a hurry and had a great convo on a positive note beverages were served in a mason jar
4340,sat at the outdoor bar by far my favorite place at st pete live music cool air blowing from the cielling fans friendly bartender and oh so delicious food our bartender recommended the tuna topped oysters sorry can t remember the name and i had the lobster ravioli yum great atmosphere loved everything
4341,great food tasty clean and courteous staff try the bosnian bread with spiced lamb very good and tasty going back for the pastries and coffee
4342,i was looking for a healthy smoothie place in the area and came across this place i decided to get food as well because i was hungry as heck i ordered a smoothie and a power bowl after i put in my order i was talking with the manager and she was so polite and helpful the place is inviting and just has a good energy about it as i was waiting for my food i noticed they had healthy soda all the flavors sounded really good and i would have gotten that but i was craving the smoothie when my food was ready i dug right in everything was delicious i don t think i breathed the entire time i would definitely recommend this place to anyone
4343,good service reasonable wine prices for a steakhouse nice southwest flavors on some dishes their best steak was a disappointment dinner here the other night first time though we ve been to the other el charro places dozens of times nice ambiance but very noisy the place was pretty empty when we were there i shudder to think of how loud it must be when crowded our server was very attentive getting drinks ordered appetizer going etc nice job splitting our caprese app on separate plates without out us even asking speaking of which this was oddly one of my favorite tastes of the evening the poblano and sauce were a nice touch and added a lot of flavor my second favorite taste was our side dish the roasted brussels sprouts they were perfectly charred and a good portion for two to share we had the ribeye surf turf special which came with a couple of very big shrimp the steak was perfectly cooked and tender but just a little bit gristly which grass fed beef often can be our companions had the tomahawk steak which was absolutely huge see photo but after the gristle was removed probably had no more usable meat than our more modestly priced ribeye the price you pay for the wow factor of the bone in cut i guess we opted out of desert just too full the tab came in at a reasonable price compared to some of the other steakhouses in town considering we had a full bottle of wine overall a very pleasant experience but they might need to trim their steaks a little better maybe some of the other cuts would be cleaner
4344,the food is really good but the service and the wait time sucks we literally spent our whole afternoon here three hours to have lunch they initially told us it was one hour wait and we decided to wait but we didn t get seated till one hour and 30 minutes later the food came 1 hour and 15 minutes later we were here sooo long it made no sense we should ve left after they told us it was a one hour wait like mentioned before the food is good but not worth the wait
4345,i come to the peppermill often to oceano for the sushi i attended my first yelp event at the game lab and had a blast it well very good and organized for the regular yelpers we got stuck with the left over food which was cold but over all a great event thank you as far as the game lab the prices were average from what i seen around town good place to allow the kids to blow off steam while the parents do some gambling p s if you haven t had the all you can eat sushi at oceano please do its awesome the atmosphere is to die for try oceano sushi and the blta rolls
4346,i have a difficult to fit foot for dance shoes lauren and sue made the whole process a pleasure they kept coming out with different shoes and sizes until we found not one but two that were perfect i highly recommend the selection and wonderful owner and staff here

4349,this is by far one of my favorite spots i get a bowl from here at least once a week the food is very good quality and so convenient it s quick easy and a healthy choice compared to other drive thru places my only constructive criticism is they do not add enough of the toppings and sauce i usually have to order extra best bowl place in town

4367,i used signature parking for a party at a friend s house in montecito in may they came through on short notice and were very reasonable in pricing though they could have easily gouged a desperate last minute customer from justin who arranged everything to the bookeeper who settled our account the customer service was friendly and professional in every way the valets were great to work with and handled all parking tasks and special requests seamlessly they were always available at a moment s notice and stayed on the job i wish every service business operated as well as signature parking i would use them again and recommend them without reservation

4384,i had two breakfasts here and my wife had dinner with the kids last night the first breakfast was a spin on eggs benedict with smothered greens it was under seasoned and just ok my wife said that her steak was ok last night and the pancakes were good this morning if not for the fact that this was located in a really cool hotel i doubt that it would see much action but given that it is it will probably survive if given no other choices it is an ok choice
4385,i had the pleasure of having my hair done by ansen the stylists at this establishment are nice and give off friendly vibes the hair washing process was thorough and relaxing ansen really listened to me and cut my hair as i requested he took his time and did an amazing job he then blow dried it to perfection not once did he tug on my hair or rush probably one of my best hair experiences will be going back and recommending this place to my friends

4392,5 star review i had the pleasure of staying at the courtyard on fourth street this past weekend the staff and location was fantastic the rooms were clean and rather large the location is just blocks away from the action and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly looking forward to staying here again,5 star one of the best banking experience i ve had in a while brian mahoney and employee was fantastic and answered all my questions he was amazing i am opening up a business nearby and he answered all of my questions and took very good care of me and my needs i am glad i found a bank and a representative as i am new in town fantastic bank i can t wait to tell everyone awesome brian
4393,i went to cured today for the first time and had an awesome experience i ve been looking for a good nail salon in nashville since i moved here over a year ago that does a decent job accepts walk ins and doesn t make me concerned that their employees are human trafficking victims the salon is lovely bright and large enough without having that massive factory feel where you know corners are probably being cut with cleanliness and you re going to feel rushed my nail tech alea was personable and did a great job i got the quick pedicure which was about 30 minutes drying time and 35 which was perfect for me they offer lengthier services for extra as well they don t have a huge selection of polish colors but they have really quality polishes like aila and chanel the best part about my experience with cured after a couple of hours at home i realized i had dinged one big toe and totally messed up the polish i zipped back there before they closed only to find a sign in the window saying they had closed early for a team meeting they saw me standing outside the door welcomed me in and fixed my toe for free while they did their training i have definitely found my nail salon home in nashville
4394,most under rated brewery on this list sun king is garbage it s just popular from publicity and ads granite city has amazing food as well keep away from their mixed drinks their margaritas are a joke downtown location is better than carmel
4395,what a fabulous restaurant i was visiting santa barbara with my nieces and we decided to get something to eat we walked in and my nieces explained they had some dietary restrictions gluten and nut allergy the hostesses were so excited to explain what all was available and so warm in their greeting that we decided to try it best decision of the day we went for happy hour and shared the shrimp tacos shrimp sliders and the crabmeat and artichoke dip all three dishes were incredible however if i was forced i guess i would say the slider was my favorite the restaurant is new as it opened march 12th but service was way better than some well established restaurants also the clean open design was a plus for me my only two regrets is that i didn t check out the second floor it must have incredible views and i did not get a drink so i can not comment on that if you are in the area i strongly recommend this restaurant especially during happy hour
4396,stopped here for lunch and to catch some world cup fun atmosphere sat at the bar and just a great midday crowd the tosco s burger cooked perfectly medium as asked is huge enjoyed the visit and will go back if in the area
4397,what great authentic german yumminess giant pretzel is a must not like any other pretzel sausage platter and schnitzel was classic but goulash over egg noodles rocked the house bonus was german music playing in the background
4398,went into this place for the first time last week and first thing i noticed is that its very clean they exaggerate with the cleaning fast service and last but not least amazing burgers
4399,excellent traditional thai the pho to the duck its all excellant the staff are alwats very friendly
4400,this was my first and probably only time i will stop by brunchies my husband and i were just passing through for work as we walked in there was a small wait they had complimentary coffee everything seemed clean so we waited only a few minutes to be seated another couple minutes before someone got our drink order probably 15 minutes before someone took our food order we started to think they forgot about us and about 30 minutes before we got our food we both got sweet tea and it was surprisingly nice for sweet tea in florida were from georgia and usually when ever we order sweet tea out of georgia its not good i ordered the luts bubba and my husband had the spinach skillet mine came with scrambled eggs with cheese potatoes and biscuit and gravy there was no seasoning on anything it was very basic not terrible at all but very simple the gravy was really lacking flavor ive had more flavorful gravy from mcdonalds honestly my husband said his tasted a little funky after only the first bite he came to the conclusion that the different flavors didnt pair well together he drowned it all in ketchup to finish it again it was very basic and simple we didnt want to order anything else because it probably would have been another 30 minute wait on food this wasnt a bad experience just lacking a lot of luster with the food the presentation was good on both of our dishes but i rather have good flavor instead
4401,we love this place we live around the corner and get sushi here probably once a week it s extremely fresh inexpensive and quick
4402,nice little coffee shop on the outskirts of the vanderbilt campus solid ambience great coffee larger place than meets the eye counters tables free wifi will go back when i travel through nashville again
4403,i visited lil dizzy s years ago early one sunday for brunch we got there right after they opened so there was no wait the place is small and kind of cramped the food was delicious but what i remember most is the bread pudding it was simply delightful i will have to visit again to see if things are still the same
4404,snow was light and fluffy and the creators behind the counter was more than generous with their syrups by dousing the ice with a second pouring of our chosen flavors we chose nectar cream and passionfruit now here s the thing i like my flavors pronounced and bold as much as the next person but i was slightly disappointed with the somewhat artificial taste of the passionfruit syrup comparing it to another place my husband and i tried on our first day here this place s homemade grapefruit basil syrup paired with their version of the nectar cream felt more light and refreshing however because theirs did not have a second dousing of flavor the syrup didn t get a chance to drizzle their way towards the bottom before we gobbled it up in the end ultimately this place is clearly popular and you re not going to leave feeling un refreshed
4405,got the cheesecake at the coffee x change on tangue verde it was really good i heard others talk about the muffins and canolis will def put that on the list for next time
4406,great place on main street super folks operate it and the bbq is beyond reproach get the fried cabbage the only knock i can think of is that the place isn t big enough so it s tough to get a table just go if you like bbq get some drinks the porch punch will knock your socks off
4407,the food is good beer is good the waitress is friendly the place isn t very lively it looks sad maybe better music or drink specials or food specials it s not over priced the just place needs something i ordered the bbq pulled pork sliders they are tasty the beer is local it s pretty good if you like beer
4408,my go to ramen place in town you d think you were ordering ramen on the street in korea or japan it s that good try to get there before 2 to get a seat reservation tends to fill up fast due to it being in sam hughes area and close to the uofa worth going and trying then all chopsticks use are recommended otherwise you ll get stares for using a fork or spoon here
4409,i stop by here twice a month for take out and try various authentic mexican foods quick service and reasonably priced clean establishment
4410,we had a fun time because it was an unusual day we had the restaurant to ourselves it was xmas eve day and not many places were open in vc this was one of our two finalists after scanning reviews of local restaurants so we ducked in to ask if they were serving lunch the waiter greeted us and said they were mainly focusing on catering for the day but he d ask the chef if she could handle cooking for us the answer came back yes but that we d be her only customer s for the day they did indeed turn other customers away after we were seated the two of them later just the chef after our waiter excused himself to do a delivery took good care of us we tried quite a few things including salad soup and main courses the food was excellent although we d probably not order the calamari sandwich again tasty but the calamari was much better without the bread and although i m sure she was really busy in the kitchen the timing of everything served worked out just right we will eat here again if we re in vc
4411,very busy friday night went upstairs to the bar to watch a game with my husband due to the busyness of the restaurant we were overlooked to be greeted by a waitress when we were greeted we were met by an adorable waitress with the biggest smile she quickly took our orders and our food was out quickly i had the veggie flatbread and i must say it was one of the best flatbreads i have ever had i was shocked great atmosphere for live music or regular dining highly recommend,quiet and quant atmosphere with fresh cold beverages as well as a variety of coffees to eat with assorted pastries did not have any of the lunch items but plenty of vegetarian options along with the normal french brunch choices cafe simeon offers nice seating outside as well as inside i sat in a comfortable fabric cushioned chair in the corner and observed the sweet waitress work tirelessly with a genuine smile on her face pastry was very light and airy with the perfect hazelnut stuffed inside very nice place to visit in st pete beach
4412,the food was amazing and lucy was a total sweetheart we came with our dog on new years eve and it was a quiet night here and everywhere in the carpinteria area the food portions were great we split the lasagna and manicotti and between that the salad and the garlic bread which were included we were very full our dog was very welcome and everyone working there stopped by to say hi to him the food was kindness was an easy 5 5 considering the location to the ocean and that they get so many people on the patio with dogs i would have thought there would be a heater that s my only negative but still 5 stars
4413,this place is awesome after my basement flooded i took a few water damaged photo albums to philadelphia photographics to see what could be done to salvage them they photos couldn t be taken out of the albums so they scanned them and made prints of each page the photos were my parents wedding and honeymoon albums so they were very important to me i felt like i could trust them to take good care of the albums they also did it for a reasonable price compared to other places i went for estimates i would highly recommend them for this type of service
4414,i stopped into angelo s pizzeria for lunch it is near work and i was wanting pizza we were quickly greeted and given menus and brought out our beverages they sell pizza by the slice so i got 2 slices of pepperoni and my wife got a calzone the calzone was huge filled with ricotta cheese pepperoni and served with a side of marinara the pizza was good it was a bit greasy but you could hold it up without it sagging the restaurant was clean had a nice interior decor and didn t have the typical feel of a new york pizza joint the prices are reasonable service was good and friendly for those reasons i rate it a bit higher than what i might based on food alone i would recommend this restaurant
4415,cute little spot to grab a coffee seats are limited salads and paninis are great i ve been here twice and the only downside i would have to say is that the staff appears to be constantly frantic unhappy probably because of how many people are constantly waiting to be seated if you have time try this place out once the weather heats up there s 4 tables out front on main street,i am so excited that soffiato via is my new go to salon located across from the moorestown community center this salon is brand new chic and cozy parking is convenient plus they have their own parking lot in the back in case street parking is limited upon entering every visit i am always accommodated with water coffee even champagne i have visited caroline twice now she is very easy to get in contact with and will work around your schedule caroline asks all the right questions gives her professional input while also listening to what you have to say want with your hair all the of employees at soffiato via work as a team and every single lady is full of energy and smiles while i was getting some color added to my hair i was made comfortable and checked on multiple times by several employees i also noticed that every station has a usb charger and outlet in case your phone needs a pick me up pricing is unbelievably fair especially for how hard the ladies work and worth every dollar i need to come more often
4416,just came home from this quietly elegant hotel ideally located in the french quarter steps off of bourbon street my room was spacious and immaculate the service was great and the included breakfast buffet excellent with a constant flow of fresh food right off the courtyard was a great little wine bar patrick s bar vin which i highly recommend i would definitely stay here again if i make it back to the big easy
4417,i cannot say enough about how incredible kristen is she photographed us on three separate occasions engagement shoot veils and tails shoot me and my dog and the wedding day and every time she went above and beyond not only is she excellent at photographing our pup her mastery of composition and lighting produce the most beautiful photos of my now husband and me she also goes beyond just photographing and did an amazing job with our magnetic save the dates i can t wait to see what she does for our wedding album for all your photography needs go with kristen
4418,this is such a unique restaurant everything they serve is fresh and caught locally that week you will find two to three variety s of fish served grilled blackened or in a taco shell it comes with red beans and rice with a side of slaw they have fabulous appetizers as well the fried pickles are lightly breaded and pack a mouthful of flavor the fish spread is also a crowd favorite and comes with pickled veggies and crackers the cocktails here are hand made and truly unique they are a bit pricey but are well made it is outdoor seating with huge fans to help keep it cool and the bar area is covered completely so if it rains you can still enjoy this spot they have live music and an upbeat atmosphere if you are looking for quality and fresh seafood this is your spot
4419,usually when i come to this chipotle i m quite pleased as some of the workers are extremely nice and helpful maybe once or twice i had a slight issue with this location usually with the portions and charging me extra on certain items when i shouldn t have been charged regardless this is one of the few chipotle s i actually enjoy
4420,great breakfast spot with lots of healthy choices the hash options allow you to pick base potatoes or sweet potatoes a plethora of veggies eggs any style and sauce of choice i had huevos rancheros and husband had the hash huevos were perfect sauce was perfect and black beans were perfect coffee was weird and bitter but that seemed to be true of many places in santa barbara i just prefer a smoother less bitter brew arrived before 9 on a saturday and service was great got busy by 9 with a line to order and most of the tables full great clean food
4421,brisket and grits the crabby wife sweet poato pancake it s a must for everybody to eat here everything was incredible
4422,ramen is sooo tasty and not too salty it s perfect the place is really cool music is great kitchen looks clean and chefs seem to be having a good time in the kitchen my new favorite place very cool
4423,i am surprised by all the negative reviews on here because we had a really pleasant experience we rented a furnished two bedroom while waiting to buy a home our move out timeline changed repeatedly and rod and evelyn in the office went above and beyond to help us and make our transition for our family as easy as possible in an already stressful time for us the pool was lovely and the maintenance staff were kind and considerate and while busy they worked hard to make sure everyone s needs were met and the grounds were well maintained the gym and clubhouse were also always cleaned and maintained our only complaint was the rude neighbors who drove way too fast through the community ignoring speed bumps and pedestrians
4424,did not disappoint a group of 6 of us went here on a friday with a long line out the door lone moved quite fast and everything we ordered was on point the hot beef sandwiches were a standout but honestly anything you order will be amazing
4425,walked across the street from our hotel for a quick lunch upon arriving in nola we were sat right away the food was very good the service was good we were asked more than once how everything was and tasted nice relaxed atmosphere would definitely go back
4426,fabulous food delicious and creative one of the best restaurants in indianapolis i had the special fanesca a creamy ecuadorian stew with cod mouth wateringly delicious
4427,i can see why this place was on the top 25 yelp for 2017 so delicious and almost everything is made in house the owner is friendly and our food was fast i got the chicken club and my husband got the molldeli special we both loved it will definitely be back
4428,breakfast brunch is our absolute favorite meal to eat out so we were pretty excited to see the new pancake house open up across from the cherry hill mall upon arrival the restaurant was pretty empty we had the option to dine in or take out so we picked a booth near the window the waitress was very kind and walked us through the menu we ordered oreo pancakes side of bacon and a mediterranean omelet the pancakes was fair not special and the bacon was slightly over cooked the real highlight of our meal was the omelet and crispy breakfast potatoes with peppers and onions the omelet was thick and fluffy highly recommend we will definitely come back to try different omelets
4429,cool vibe to drink and eat good beverages and food love it has character lots of it if you like chains or bright places with pop music go elsewhere the bartenders have a personality and knowledge and give an honest opinion they are excited about the beer and drinks they serve and the food too philadelphia isn t always on my travel plans but when i get here i come here experience some character cheers
4430,we came from center city because the corn cheese mix they do with their nachos really goes unmatched for the rest of the menu fish tacos burnt to a visible crisp pitcher of margs more watery than margy we left and went for drinks elsewhere wait staff was extremely available tho 3 stars because of waitstaff won t travel back for food again
4431,i am totally impressed with lucky cab on st patrick s day my friend and i jumped in a lucky cab and took a short but safe journey home as i was getting my wallet out to pay i accidentally set my entire set of keys on the seat next to me it wasn t until the next morning that i realized i had misplaced them after stressing out big time i called lucky cab on monday and spoke with mo not only to my ultimate delight did he have my keys he offered to drop them off at my employer s office talk about service with a smile i was so grateful small town service with dedication and sincerity you can t go wrong thank you again mo
4432,i love this place if your ready to go to carb heaven then this is the place for you i love the malted shakes here and the cheese curds my absolute favorite of all time
4433,what a really cool little coffee shop and placed a just get a bite bite to eat unlike words located in has a little found newport kids or dogs i personally went in play then it myself awesome area nice people it was really fun
4434,the best place for oysters go during the daily happy hour between 3 to 6pm the oyster is 75 cents with a size of an egg and the drinks are 50 off
4435,phenomenal delicious i have eaten here multiple times and have yet to be disappointed the food is so fresh and memorable they are doing it right the staff have been friendly attentive as well and the level of care isn t easy to come by love it
4436,it was ok but i won t be back they treat their white customers waaayyy better than their black customers and keep in mind the owner and all the staff are black i walked in behind two white guys and the lady serving the food explained to them with great gusto the food options of the day another lady passed by and joked with them it s my turn and i m excitedly expecting the same treatment the lady serving the food looks at me with a bored look on her face and mumbles what do you want i was taken aback i had never been there before so i asked her to tell me what were the dishes of the day she wasn t helpful at all and didn t recommend anything while i was eating my food it became even more apparent that the black ladies were treating the white customers much better than the black customers white people would walk through the door and they were greeted black customers including myself walked through the door and we got zero greetings they were also super friendly and jokey with the white customers in general it was a very awkward experience because i felt like even the white guys were looking and noticing the very different treatment i was getting as a black woman it was not a welcoming experience at all it was so unwelcoming that i won t be back quite embarrassing with regards to the food i was not impressed at all it was all very ok the flavors were ok the ice cream was too sweet and not creamy i got the praline ice cream i prefer for my food to have more texture everything was sort of mushy bread pudding grits mac cheese and okra gumbo didn t feel like i was getting too many vitamins plus it was hard to believe it was all vegan would help if they listed the ingredients in their dishes
4437,good service and a nice evening but i was not a fan of the noodles they were to soft for my pallet it was reasonably priced and easy to find on the main drive in broad ripple
4438,excellent little italian neighborhood restaurant bar in ardmore specializing in pizza pasta sandwiches salads soup and craft beer fresh food family friendly environment and definitely worth a visit
4439,got off work early and decided to give this place a try staff is nice for the amount of annoying kids here food is amazingly priced even though i came on the most expensive jump day carpets and mats in front of the blow up things need cleaned overall great place will try again soon,went for 5 tuesday s and it was amazing located on the side of washington square mall it has plenty of parking 5 movie tickets 5 popcorn and unlimited refills on your drinks the theaters have really nice chairs that move and recline out remind me of lazy boys i m from the west side and this was my first time going to a movie theater out east so sketched out at first hence why i haven t tried one in the two years living out here due to a scare of bed bugs or something crazy not the case the place was super clean with really friendly staff the only bummer is the assigned seating thankfully i got two together so my daughter and i would be next to each other once in there i had to kick a lady out of my seat she was not happy they have the letter of the row on the carpet outside the aisle and the seat numbers on the front of them lit up overall i was amazed and pleased with this location and will be returning next tuesday for another watch
4440,oh my god this place is amazing the people are so incredibly kind and made us feel so welcome we loved it here and loved the atmosphere they have cheap drinks as well as great company we will definitely be coming can here when we visit new orleans loved it
4441,came here for dinner and drinks and me and my fianc had an awesome experience the parking lot on the side made it very convenient to park and come right inside the chicken quesadilla was delicious and my fianc ordered the five alarm burger and to his delight it was perfectly cooked and seasoned and spicy we will definitely be coming back soon cameron was our server and he was awesome ps the full moon mojito is super yummy
4442,this place is amazing we walked in at 630 on a friday night with decent weather and none of the pro sports teams in town somehow snagged a table the staff hostile was polite and said give me a minute and i ll get you seated she did just that the ambiance is amazing beautiful place nice decorated with a modern feel comfortable seating good lighting waiter brian was awesome he knew the drinks he knew the menu thw drinks came quickly and were perfectly made it was busy sushi was amazing it came quickly was plated nicely and the fish was beatifilly cut and tasted like it was swimming this morning we had quite the feast sampling several of the menu options sushi sashimi rolls blah blah blah it s great you won t regret coming here i do recommend getting a reservation we lucked out it s not cheap but you should already know that by the on the main paige for reviews very worth it by any standard
4443,the vibe was cute waited in line for a table on a friday morning but the wait was over an hour instead decided i was going to get a take out coffee it took 15 mins to order and i waited another 15 mins for the coffee that was just average don t think i d bother trying to come here again not worth the wait
4444,unfortunately my dog passed away due to another completely different company facilities negligent behavior but this place was very amazing with trying to help save her and how they treated us after the very hard emotional experience we went through thank you for the amazing staff and service it made this heartbreakingly horrible experience a bit easier
4445,service was quite responsive they kept our glasses full i had the crab cake plate and the cake was mainly crab not filling i wish they had small portions of the crab soup i was lusting after a taste but the bowl looked like a full meal
4446,there is something for everyone at trips we got there around 10 30am and were told we could get breakfast lunch or dinner anything in the menu we started with fried green tomatoes and shoestring onion rings delicious best corned beef hash and shrimp and grits around and the service was unbelievable vicky lynn was sweet as pie to our kids tons of amazing desserts too by the way thanks for taking such good care of us
4447,love this place discovered it last year during hot august nights and made it a point to eat there twice this year i have yet to find a disappointing item on the menu from their chingalingas appetizer to the tacos all great here s where it might get a little weird though if you are a fan of calamari i cannot recommend the calamari steak enough it is amazing so tender and lightly breaded with an incredible lemon sauce this struck me as being completely off the wall for a mexican restaurant but i m glad i tried it i have to have it every single time the joint itself is pretty unassuming just a basic restaurant with the obligatory laminate tables and neon bar lights the food is what sets it apart for sure
4448,this place is a gem near the airport the staff is top notch very friendly the food is pretty tasty as well the manager charlie was incredibly welcoming highly recommend
4449,loved this place cheesey and meaty is as good as it gets i hope to return to nashville again
4450,ahh the peppermill what can i say this place treats you right been coming here for 15years win money drink until your hearts content
4451,my go to restaurant when i don t know what i want to eat or where the renovations turning this into a brewery are great they kept the best parts to give it a vintage feel and every time i eat here their food never disappoints i have tried almost everything on their menu to the point that i have a hard time choosing what i want to eat bc it is all so good
4452,this place was busy but they managed to give us a table for two right away we order a yellow curry special and spicy noodles the chicken tom ka soup that came with our special was one of the best i ever tasted next time i will get the large pot of tom ka soup everything we ate was delicious the spices in every dish made them all uniquely tasty not a fancy restaurant but a great place to eat with family after a day at the beach
4453,this place is great wine and cheese room fresh mozzarella is to die for we use their catering all of the time for our parties strongly recommend their food for your next catering lunch time does get busy but their food is just amazing if i had to criticize anything their deli sandwich ordering process could use some improvement it s so busy and there seems to be chaos in that area all the time
4454,thankful that we have a really good restaurant in alton the food is high quality fresh and well prepared i even liked it to a five star when they prepared the food with more delicious sauces as in the past don t go on wine wednesdays or save a table for me
4455,visited this restaurant on a recommendation and the food was fabulous we sat outside and had a friendly young man as our waiter i remember he was from philadelphia but can t find where i jotted his name for this review my husband ordered a hamburger which was cooked to perfection and i had the seafood beignet honestly my beignet was one of the best meals i ve ever eatthe only disappointment was i ordered the peanut butter and jelly cheesecake and you were out of it another good perk we took a streetcar and restaurant is 2 3 blocks from stop
4456,went here on a monday with couple of friends for some drinks and small meals all the while also looking for a new monday spot i ordered two appetizers and a glass of pomegranate juice my total came to 25 whoa that s a little pricey for small plates wings good crab cakes good cornbread fritters good shrimp tacos meh the texture was good however a whole shrimp is placed in middle of a taco shell it ll be so much better if they were at least chopped up so it spreads in the shell more the coleslaw was bland not much flavor to it overall the shrimp tacos just didn t cut it for us i will not be ordering it in the future our server was good but there were couple of times when he was nowhere to be found when we needed something needless to say this won t be a regular monday spot
4457,craft drinks amazing food that is always quality one of my favorite places to eat always great service happy hour is great i cant imagine you not being overly satisfied if you visit
4458,this place was amazing the wasabi guacamole was so good my boyfriend said i could eat this off my shoe it is so good we met the owner and she was so sweet she really valued our opinions we are here for a few days and will definitely be back it was so hard to choose what to eat everything sounded good
4459,for starters there is a really good atmosphere the table where we sat had cushions to sit on it reminded me of what i might see in a traditional east asian home our service was prompt and fabulously delivered by waitress air our family had an assortment of appetizers and entrees we thought the red curry and pad thai dishes were the best we d had ever we also ordered the spicy noodle dish with tofu which was a major crowd pleaser at our table and definitely was as beloved as the pad thai and red curry the coconut flavor of the red curry shines through the shrimp were perfectly cooked and plump we also had coconut ice cream with fried banana shaped like pillows in phyllo dough or similar for dessert best coconut ice cream ever creamy awesome coconut flavor and there are seemingly soft chunks of coconut in the ice cream as well that being said my sister who doesn t especially like coconut still really enjoyed the dessert we all really enjoyed the fried banana overall we so look forward to going back
4460,this particular culvers was voted third best culvers in the entire nation last year i can see why it is really one of the best culvers not the best but definitely in the top 5
4461,loved loved loved the biscuits the pig ears soft and addictive goat curry might be one of my favorite dishes ice cream churned every day
4462,great creative food super friendly staff and efficient i ve had a good experience every time i ve been in
4463,loved the santeria cocktail any sweet and spicy kick to anything i m with it the french onion grilled cheese sammich was great service was great music was bomb too if you love whiskey this is a nice little restaurant bar soire
4464,the pulled pork barbecue was excellent as were the sides cole slaw bean and sweet potato fries the food arrived surprisingly quickly my water glass was never empty the caramel apple cobbler was excellent as well but the theme here was how excellent the service was to make the experience all the better of course the very best part was seeing my name plastered everywhere it made for a unique experience
4465,the fact that i am giving the irish times a well deserved five star review is of little consequence inasmuch as it is now permanently closed and out of business this happened just before labor day weekend
4466,this place doesn t really need anymore reviews but i just had to say something if you are anywhere near district donuts go there the donuts were fluffy and delicious and came in all sorts of fun flavors the best part though was the vietnamese iced coffee strong but sweet it s some of the best iced coffee i ve ever had and i m kindddd of an iced coffee addict staff was friendly and the interior is super cute so happy we made the stop while in town
4467,the staff was super nice here the manager i think her name was annie made sure to say hi and a waitress named mandy served us she was hilarious brightened up my afternoon very friendly and inviting great selection of beer i ll be coming again soon for sure
4468,the fiesta buffet is always really good we typically go on seafood thursday it is really important to get their early or else you are standing in line for 30 mins to get a seat however when you get it the staff never make you feel rushed and allow you to get you 30 worth of food
4469,the foods really good and reasonably priced but the tables for two are so close together it s uncomfortable also it s byob
4470,excellent meal service was super friendly and attentive cacio e pepe milan salad eggplant parm and the stack fabulous food byob highly recommend a visit
4471,went on a monday morning and the line was around the corner we were debating if we should wait or find another place it only took us 30 minutes to get seated which was pretty quick compared to how long the line looked the pancakes were amazing and the staff was really nice
4472,awesome food beautiful ambience service is awesome pad thai butternut squash soup and ushroom tostada was so good
4473,i don t eat a ton of chinese takeout because i haunt various local asian markets and buy and cook the stuff myself but a small cooking accident and a burned hand lead me to order out at this south chinese vietnamese place and i was pretty satisfied with the result my order was hot and freshly ready in just under ten minutes i barely had time to hit an atm around the corner it wasn t super cheap i paid for two dishes what i would have paid for three at the cheapest of such places but the portion sizes were such that i ll get 2 5 3 meals anyway which is about right for the price and it was respectable american chinese cuisine with my kung pao dish highlighted by a mix of vegetables and a decent amount of peanuts and my lemongrass tofu having the option of noodles or rice with a little salad and separate sauce on the side nothing world beating and if i wanted to i could get mad at them for their spicy dishes not being particularly hot but i got a good meal for some reason it came in styrofoam containers rather than the typical chinese food cartons and i was instructed to hold the bag level to avoid spillage even being cautious there was still a bit of sauce on the bottom of the bag if they wanted five stars from me they could do things like improve those containers or not sneak broccoli into dishes where it isn t listed or offer non soy vegetarian dishes for variety but their menu now isn t bad their online menu proudly proclaims that the dishes in its vegetarian section are prepared with vegetarian ingredients which sounds redundant until you realize that chinese places can and will sneak in something that isn t so i appreciate that notification and will most likely order something else from that menu the next time i decide i want chinese takeout
4474,i love mongolian bar b q but the price at chu s is outrageous the soup is good the iced tea sucked so bad we complained with no result the food is self service and what you make it i detested getting my check at the register with suggested tip amounts on it before they cook your food tip for what eating in a dirty overpriced restaurant
4475,i will forever be calling upon delicious designs whenever i need some tasty and beautifully crafted desserts when i met leigh anne and saw her work i immediately knew that she was the woman for the job to create our wedding cake leigh anne is incredible and pays such close attention to detail she listens to what it is that her customers want and makes sure that everything is exactly the way you want it to be everyone at our wedding raved about how beautiful and delicious the cake and tarts were i highly recommend this bakery
4476,great place to go for a burger if your in the downtown area it was a beautiful day so the outside seating made for a nice lunch
4477,best place for pho sandwiches vermicelli salad and boba drinks this restaurant is always pack and you know it s a good place when you re a minority highly recommended
4478,okay i think i m addicted i ll never go to chipotle again support a good local business with a super friendly staff if you go enough they for sure recognize you i ve been going once a week for a month the burrito is so well packed with the ingredients having tried a few combo s i recommend the spanish rice comes with peas and corn the chip salsa is awesome tough to not leave without a bag for the road try it out
4479,nic at aaa was great working with us he found the best deal for our trip our last 3 trips was through aaa and never have they failed us
4480,great greek restaurant had great octopus and amazing sangrias with multiple flavors we got the blue raspberry and it was one of the best sangrias i ve ever had great desserts as well if you have a sweet tooth,great food i always get the buffalo chicken meatballs which are the best you can also sit outside and watch football and in the colder weather you can sit by the fire drinking a nice cold one oh and they have beer bongs
4481,my friends and i used to love coming here for their burgers until my most recent visit they changed their menu and it s nowhere near as good the bread for the burgers is different and feels like low quality overly soft white bread the burger itself is a lot less juicy they also changed their fried pickles to some other fried veggie mix which is alright but doesn t touch the old fried pickles our server ashley was great but i hope they return the menu to its former glory
4482,we nom here all the time freshly made waffle cones and delicious ice cream the waffle cone bowls and banana splits are incredible but the italian ice is just ok but it s an ice cream stand so what are you doing getting italian ice if i had to change anything the kids who work there need some better customer service training they don t greet customers no niceties thanks you re welcome have a nice day and they are very slooooow to do anything but i also get that it s a little ice cream stand staffed with a bunch of angsty teenagers who can t be bothered with basic professionalism pretty much what you d expect and not enough to stop me from enjoying their tasty frozen treats
4483,it was my last night in the nola area but i didn t want to travel far or pay outrageous prices for a meal i found carrabbas on yelp it was close to where i was staying my fried and i decided to give it a try because it could be vegetarian friendly well that does not mean it can be vegan friendly as i found out my server rebecca p was nice enough but seemed clueless as to what vegan means so we looked over the menu and i decided on a pasta dish but i would have to modify it a bit to fit my dietary needs rebecca brought us our ice tea and my friend ordered first now i know vegan sounds complicated but it s not it s just this nothing with a mother and no dairy or eggs so i began explaining my dish but seems rebecca was not understanding so i began to explain with my hands sort of like an italian might do boom i knocked over my ice tea all over the table we recovered and moved to another table while they cleaned up my spill mess ok back to the ordering a veggie pasta with red sauce and extra veggies no meat or dairy i thought i got that right and that our server understood the order hhhhmmm at least i was hoping that when it came time to be served he order was wrong no extra mushrooms and not a drop of red or marinara sauce what ok the poor man serving the food it was not rebecca was wide eyed as both me and my friend in unison said that s not what i ordered our server didn t come by but juan the kitchen manager came over and asked me how he could help he took the dish back to the kitchen mixed in some red sauce and gave me more on the side then blake a floor manager and seems he was serving at the bar too came by to talk to us he was pleasant enough too now i think rebecca was flustered and didn t come by until after that she asked me if i was being taken care of and that the kitchen juan took care of the mixed up order yea it was but this should have been her job rebecca seems like a nice woman maybe she just needs to understand what vegan entails some of us have to eat this way not just because it a choice but because it s about health concerns and we still want to go out and eat with our friends i don t know if it was the kitchen or the server that made the mistake but you would have thought that with such a harsh start to the meal then a let down in the middle a discount or coupon would have been offered nothing so while we made due the mess was undone by my standards i am grateful for the effort and i would try the food chain restaurant again but i ll be even more clear on my menu choices and options also it might be wise for this chain to offer at least a couple of vegan options hot and cold that are not just appetizers i ll say this about juan and blake they did their best and went out of the way to make me feel comfortable and welcomed that s a good way to get repeat business next time offer the customer a 50 00 coupon that s a way to secure that repeat business it doesn t need to be for me just anyone that feels a bit upside down on the menu and service lol
4484,we had a huge group of people around lunch time and had awesome meals the coconut shrimp were the best we ve ever had and the service was great everyone enjoyed their meals
4485,very tasty pho and friendly staff i will be sure to eat at lilly s again when i return to nola
4486,the hotel is beautifully done it has a boutique feel and not like just a normal hotel like the hilton i had my birthday party there at the restaurant and it was so very nice the service was wonderful and the rooms are beautiful the air conditioner was pretty loud in our room but that is my only complaint it s very close to printers alley which is so cool i would definitely stay in this hotel again
4487,the happiest place on earth is in florida but its not disney al s finger licking good bar b que is the happiest place on earth its also the best restaurant i ve ever been to and i ve been to restaurants that have michelin stars in fact where is al s michelin star its far and away the most pleasant eating experience ever once the food is served i do not speak until the plate is clean not even if somebody was asking me a question not even if i was on a first date and yes this is the perfect place to bring a date why because if she doesn t like it she s not the kind of person you should be with it may sound like i m exaggerating but i m not i recently moved from tampa to tallahassee and the thing i miss most is al s i miss al s more than i miss my friends and family because i still talk to them on the phone but when it comes to al s there is no substitute
4488,been waiting a very long time to visit this spot one word love fresh food friendly and fast service atmosphere is fun
4489,their boneless pork steak sandwich reminds me of the mcrib from mcdonald s save your money
4490,great gyro and pork souvlaki the gyro was stuffed full of very tender meat had the saganaki to start which had a nice texture and mild flavor we d have all of these again our server was attentive and very friendly add in the free parking and thus place is a home run
4491,never disappointed at maynards outstanding arizona wines the celery bisque and bistro salad made for excellent appetizers as main dishes we had trout and swordfish respectively the fish was exquisitely prepared leaving its inherent flavor come through not smothering it in sides to top it off an outstanding peach budino attentive prompt service great experience
4492,great atmosphere that pays total homage to tampa mostly local vendors in a sundry setting that has something to offer for everyone clean and fresh with energetic employees great new tampa addition
4493,this ice cream place was delicious service was good interior was nice the whole place is painted pink which is awesome and they have a back wall gil of kids eating ice cream it s adorable the ice cream is affordable like any other ice cream shop also they don t take cards cash only will definitely be back
4494,amazing place food is simply delicious here high quality ingredients in all of their dishes this place is most certainly a diamond in the rough,i was skeptical about this place because some of the reviews appeared fake however i was pleasantly surprised with the food quality they don t have any wait staff it is one of those self service places but the food is amazing it is pretty obvious they use quality ingredients we ordered pork namsod and soft rolls fresh rolls for apps and seafood green curry all 4 5 and the prices are very reasonable
4495,had a great dinner at spasso my parents always request oana and she is an awesome server answers questions gives suggestions and really knows the menu we were quoted an hour wait but were able to grab a high top in the bar area with no wait they are full service spasso is italian but has its own little spin it s not just the classic dishes of a typical italian restaurant they start you off with bread and this delicious eggplant pepper topping that is so refreshing i typically love oil for bread but love this alternative i started with a caesar salad which was perfect just enough dressing super fresh and i love the shaved parmesan on top for dinner i had pappardelle porcini which i think is the best item on the menu it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes mushrooms and chicken with light sauce it is totally delicious and i had leftovers to have for lunch the next day spasso is definitely recommended for a great dinner in media
4496,pretty good and consistent can walk here from our house when in the mood for thai it definitely satisfies
4497,to start i ve been coming to noble since they opened and have never experienced a better restaurant in the wesley chapel area it starts with the servers bartenders and managers who always welcome me with a smile and a friendly how are you or we haven t seen you lately because of that noble has quickly become my version of cheers where everyone knows your name needless to say the staff always goes above and beyond to make all guests feel welcome if there s ever a question or concern you can guarantee that will jason or any other manager on that day will quickly attend and resolve the matter on top of the great staff the drinks and food are amazing i ve never had a bad meal and i ve tried most of the menu many people may not be aware that all of their ingredients are locally grown and sourced which makes each dish stand out from the competition also the menu is constantly evolving based off the season and available ingredients so there s plenty to try if you re looking for a classy unique establishment with excellent people in wesley chapel this is the place for you
4498,i had a great experience the few times i went and received prompt and dedicated attention from joe thank you they tailored a suit for a funeral extremely quickly bah did my suit alterations and did a great job the only knock i have is that the store can get very busy so try to avoid peak hours the staff are courteous and professional but occasionally a little patience is required when they are busy
4499,we ve eaten there a few times i should have written reviews immediately after we ate there but i forgot to everything we ve had here is delicious and very fresh we love the food everyone is friendly and helpful we ll be back for many meals
4500,amazing biscuits and fill in the blank great cocktails too highly recommended a bit busy though
4501,ok i have rented from hertz here a number of times and never felt compelled to leave a review tonight is the exception when i walked out of the airport with my luggage after a three hour delay the hertz bus was there the air conditioning was pumping thank goodness and the driver was delightful when i got to the rental center i had my pick of cars and chose a clean suv as i pulled out to show id a very nice guy checked me out showed me some features i didn t know about and gave me a bottle of water great experience
4502,this is one of my favorite restaurants in nola i come here everytime i m in town such sweet people who work here and incredible food best charbroiled oysters i ve ever had also on that list are the frog legs they don t take reservations but were able to seat our large group of 15 w o any issues thank you katie s for always being a culinary highlight to my nola trips
4503,after not dying my hair since 2015 i knew it was time to switch it up try something new before summer they did such a great job i received a lot of compliments will be returning
4504,awesome barbecue here i had a small party of 20 for lunch pulled pork with special sauce was great and the ribs where amazing feel right off the bone the sides and homemade cornbread was yum it s family owned and operated the family and staff was very friendly and kind
4505,what a great event 1st time i ve gone and loved it tried 2 different kinds of ribs walked around all the arts and crafts had some yummy jumbo onion rings great festival great day and lots of great food recommend to all
4506,verify impressed with the speed of service and attention to small details lunch was delicious and efficient
4507,hmm i want to like it here but the ok service and the ok food are what kill me i had to send my chicken sandwich back for being undercooked and my husbands fries were old cold we had a big party and only one main server who was trying her best to keep up
4508,i can t say enough good things about the rincon beach club and the staff at events by rincon every time i work an event that events by rincon has anything to do with the end result is always a successful event with satisfied customers the owners of this business marc carol are two of the most humble humans i have met they have clearly poured their entire life savings hard work into creating this amazing wedding event service it is a must that you go with them when in need of catering and or a beautiful venue
4509,i really liked the deep dish hot chicken pizza the ranch is amazing but the thin crust pizza is not good the wait for food is ridiculous and carry out always seems to be cold i gave this place a chance but i am extremely underwhelmed
4510,quality breakfast brunch spot i ordered the yolk all star breakfast with the french toast i enjoyed my french toast although it was odd that 2 slices were well done brown and two were slightly less done gold like but taste wise that didn t bother me too much because both were good the bacon was amazing i m a huge fan of bacon but so many places have cheap bacon that is more fat than meat not this place unfortunately i was not a fan of the sausage it was certainly undercooked so i took it to go and fried it the next morning i d definitely go back but maybe not get sausage
4511,loved this place 10 years ago when i was in college and love it now that i m back in town pizza and ranch are really good they did renovations and it looks so much better inside and upstairs
4512,one of our best nights started out here make sure to grab a reservation it s a great place for small plates good drinks and great music in an intimate setting
4513,my friend and i went here for breakfast brunch be prepared to have a lengthy wait because between this place and biscuit love everything was packed while we waited for a table we got some tea and pastries i got the honeysuckle rose tea hot which had a very subtle flavor and didn t need sweetener my friend had the lavender hibiscus and all you could taste was lavender it seriously tasted like you were drinking the liquid version of the flower our pastries were divine i had a peanut butter cookie and she had a strawberry scone this scone was so good that while we were sitting outside on the picnic table eating them and drinking our tea the wind picked up and she said oh my gosh my heart dropped because my scone almost flew away once we got seated the breakfast was very good and the service was incredible i had the big kid breakfast and she had the dirty benny all of the ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly
4514,great tour i went on the tour that covered philly for 4 5 hours well informed guide it met my expectation only issue is that it went over time due to a lunch break my advice keep it under 4 hrs inform the tourist they should bring snacks and water it limits the chances you will have tourist dip out on the tour and it operates efficiently
4515,i love this place and it s a shame that it s never beer busy when i come here their food is amazing and the owners and staff are so friendly and attentive this is my go to bbq place in the area and will always be the owners live above it and really care about the place she chatted with us about their catering orders so that s something you may want to consider if you re looking to cater something they also do carry out and you can call in a carry out order the daily specials are separate for dining in and carrying out however
4516,yeah i thought this very instagram trendy tourist trappy place was just average but i m willing to give it a second chance because it might have been the food i ordered i don t know why but at brunch places i typically get the heartier breakfast items even though i ll end up disappointed that i didn t order the more desserty dish instead probably because we ate here during actual lunch and past prime brunch time i ordered a hearty dish again the vegetarian grits i thought it was okay but nothing to write home about i didn t get a biscuit with my meal but our table did order bonuts so i got to at least taste the biscuit dough and it was good if i come back i d order those again in addition to a more desserty dish btw i ve yet to find a great vegetarian breakfast dish in nashville vegetarian breakfasts are not bland
4517,let me tell you about this red lobster they do a great job i ordered the lobster maine with steak this option gives you a choice of the filet mignon or strip i went with the strip this meal comes with a salad i ordered the caesar and mojitos my steak medium slightly more to the medium rare was cooked perfectly very juicy my lobster tail was delicious the caesar was very good as well this meal will run you about 40 not including the mojitos the only reason this review receives 4 instead of 5 stars is due to my drinks and the server the drink wasn t terrible but for the price they really skimped on the additives which of course impacts taste i love mojitos and was disappointed by the scattered pieces of the single leaf of mint inside i do not have the serve name for this review however a tall tanned complexioned gentleman my server responded and served but was very standoffish and slightly abrupt in general i observed him at other tables this was his approach for all guests he may need to be in the back doing something that does not involve customer interaction like dishes but for that steak i will be back just not during his shift
4518,my first time visiting this place i was told it s been here for about 2 yrs i walked in and was greeted promptly truck took care of me she gave me a very nice mani pedi i asked for french pedi with thin white line she was excellent usually salons apply too thick of a line and have to remove half of it truc s smile pleasant attitude was a welcomed sight very lovely person the facility is easy to find just off veterans on transcontinental the massage spa chairs were comfy there was not that strong chemical smell which i hate gives me an instant headache there were plenty of polish colors to choose from well staffed and moderately priced i would definitely return the next time i m in town
4519,they did a great job with my son s superhero cake the bakery was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful when i went to order i just showed them a couple of pictures of what i was looking for and they they came through everyone loved the taste too i will definitely order here again
4520,i couldn t have had a better experience working paul jr to find the perfect engagement ring i went into cozzi about a week before christmas and told paul that i planned on proposing on nye he told me that would be cutting it close especially with it being their busy season but said he would do everything he could to get it done in time paul more than came through by having the ring done on the 27th which provided a huge sigh of relief for me before the big day as for picking out the ring paul couldn t have made it any easier i showed him picture what i was looking for and he immediately found one of theirs that was almost identical we went through all the different options and within an hour i felt great about what we came up with also i never felt rushed or pressured by paul and it seems he really just wants to make sure you re completely happy with the finished product lastly my fianc was completely blown away by the ring the only thing i messed up was having the wrong ring size my fianc went in the following week and paul was happy to resize the ring and clean it free of charge altogether paul jr was great and i highly recommend cozzi
4521,i can t say enough wonderful things about this practice and the staff i rescued my dog and they were the vet the rescue sent me to i went in not knowing what to expect as i was leaving dr platts office i asked them to call and transfer my older dogs records to colmar and never looked back dr platt is amazing the word amazing is not enough to explain how she treats her patients her staff is the very best not only are they wonderful to the animals but they are caring and patient with the parents my boys love them and that is all i need to know if you don t believe go see for yourself
4522,love this place the atmosphere is very laid back and the lavender vanilla latte was delicious perfect place to study or relax with a book
4523,one of if not the best pizza places around the chicken bacon rancher pizza is the best and beats any other kind of place that sells it boneless wings are also pretty good
4524,ice cream is pretty good and the espresso is ok i recommend the black cherry bathrooms are clean and service is pretty good they offer a variety of flavors and combinations overall it is pretty good and very fair pricing for being in downtown nashville service was great
4525,do not mix vegan chocolate with mint chocolate chip together in a shake staff was awesome though
4526,whose ever momma they have chiefing in the back i want to hug her lol i was skeptical at first due to google reviews vs yelp reviews and uber eats rating however i was pleased that the ribs were very tender and flavorful mac and cheese wasn t the kraft with the watery cheese if any another winner and the yams taste like love was in em i m glad i took the chance i know you can t please everybody and some people are just unbelievable with their expectations the customer isn t always right sometimes they have bad taste buds i will definitely be ordering from them again
4527,this was the perfect place to serve as home base for our family s trip to new orleans we stayed in a two room suite and it was spacious and clean with tall ceilings and lots of natural light the drury serves complementary drinks and light dinner each night and breakfast each morning which saved us a bundle this will be our go to place whenever we return to nola
4528,i ve ate at this fazoli s a few time now and the food and service has been good the food has always been hot and i really like their ultimate spaghetti and baked spaghetti the restaurant is usually clean but some tables are left dirty too long on some of the trips they didn t bring out fresh bread sticks but i had enough with my meal it takes about 10 15 minutes to get meal but it is pasta not a deep fried chicken strip so i m not sure why people on this forum are complaining about the wait time
4529,the food and the service are outstanding the best smoked fish ive ever eaten and huge portions
4530,service was good and the food was good but we felt very rushed ordered the chef tasting and then a drink assuming it would be 10 15 minutes until the first course arrived our drinks arrived and 30 seconds later course one plus wine pairing we could not keep up with the wine and food pairing all evening desert arrived and one bite in our check arrived when i am spending 115 a person for a tasting menu i expect better kitchen management and should not have to sprint through the meal our server was lovely and gentleman who seated us was polished and a restaurant vet the food was good but 5 out of 10 good the chef tasting which was recommended was obviously what the kitchen was prepared for hot plates and warm to slightly cool food means advanced preparation and sorbet that has been hanging out in the blast chiller vs scooped to order small but crucial details maybe this was an off night but i am sure that when all things are firing properly the food and experience is outstanding doubt i will go back hoped for more than good
4531,wow what a cute spot now the wait was out of this world 85 min but it was so worth it plus they have great coffee and a neat indoor waiting area that helps kill some time this was my first time at milk and honey and i must say their attention to detail is crazy the decor and everything is so cohesive and thoughtfully done but y all want to know about the food right lol ordering the cinnamon roll is a must i repeat it is a must so incredibly delicious their horchata coffee another must the hash was also delicious if you re touristy like me and like collectibles or have an insane mug fetish be prepared you will drop a pretty penny on some cool mugs and house made honey lol overall great place love the style food and hospitality
4532,the bayou burger is literally the best burger i ve ever had great staff also definitely a big thumbs up
4533,large portions of authentic food at reasonable prices but ambience could use an upgrade can see the tenants if the contest restaurant that came before it but flavors are food enough to compensate i had the chicken schwarma lunch special which was moist and filling hubby had the beef schwarma stirfry which he devoured lentil soup was amazing plenty of free parking and liked like there were quite a few take out orders when we were there
4534,i had a salad prime rib medium well baked potato the salad and warm bread rolls were tasty the prime rib was delicious everything i had was good there is a bar and tables with white linen and candles my hostess gigi and waitress cecelia were awesome good spot to take a meeting date family or reservations the parking is the only problem though their is parking across the street next to the dollar tree or you can park at woodlawn library and walk a couple of blocks the prices are somewhat high seafood and steak are always expensive i know they have specials and a raw bar on thursdays i would recommend to eat at this establishment nice atmosphere and good eats
4535,i ve been coming here since i was a kid now that my mom lives within walking distance i have to talk myself out of coming here every day the best donuts i ve ever tasted hands down i love going on weeknights when they are fresh out of the fryer oven and still warm surprisingly no matter the night there can be a few people in line so i m not the only one in on this secret my favorites are the apple fritters and the old fashioned so so good please try anything here you won t regret it and nothing will keep you away
4536,great atmosphere and decor super friendly staff seat you right away i stopped once for lunch and one time for dinner they have some lunch specials one of which was pad thai i order with chicken as the protein but they have the typical options for this the portion was good for lunch and had good flavor for dinner i ordered the chicken satay to start and the panang curry with chicken for main course i was very disappointed in the satay being that you only get two small skewers the flavor and peanut dipping sauce were very good but they give a few more skewers the panang was good and you get a good size portion of rice on a side note i was disappointed they do not have pad see ew still some other options on the menu i will return to try the staff and manager really know customer service look forward to returning soon
4537,i went there on friday night for my birthday celebration while we did have to wait 45 mins for our table to be ready even with a reservation the staff totally made up for it the awesome bartender gave my friends and i a round of drinks for free due to the long wait he also gave me another free drink for my birthday the waiter was quick and friendly the food was delicious and portions were huge the bartender came back over and gave us a free bottle of champagne to celebrate the staff went above and beyond my friends and i were very grateful i would definitely go back there again
4538,i prefer this place over banana leaf or penang in the chinatown area food tastes good good vegetarian options i just like fusion places like this featuring food from a particular region in asia good first impression when i came with a friend definitely will be back to try out more dishes,okay vietnamese restaurant if you want vietnamese and this is only one in the neighborhood they are doing a good job catering to the crowd here but for me i have to travel to other neighborhoods for a more authentic and good tasting vietnamese food their portions are smaller pho isn t great pho is always about the broth so when you don t have that foundation everything else falls apart
4539,waay cool like the one in vegas hidden in a corner of the casino super cool hang great music videos too
4540,i took my dog in for urinary problems she had been on antibiotics to see if it was an infection but the problem kept recurring they did a sonogram and found a mass in her bladder most likely cancerous they put her on anti inflammatory medication which helped immensely with her frequent urination problems sadly her case is terminal but the staff was very compassionate and helpful we do not know how long we will have her with us but we are grateful for the doctors and staff here for helping us through this last journey with our sweet pup thank you
4541,we visited this location a total of four times in a two month period while we were staying in the area the food was good each time but the service was vastly different each time the last time we almost left this is something the restaurant needs to work on with their servers if our last experience was our only experience i would have only given a two star rating
4542,wow what a great addition to lansdale stopped in on founders day and so glad we did super friendly staff and an interactive manager very impressive didn t order food so can not comment on that but had fun sampling beers loved that they give you a small sample to try before ordering great atmosphere love the section for kids with games and sofa just overall great addition for keeping lansdale alive
4543,the atmosphere is a cool vibe staff is always friendly and the food is very good favourite thing on the menu would be a brunch pirate poutine with side of bacon but can t go wrong with any of their options
4544,the hubby and i started off with the supreme nacho and they were pretty yummy make sure to add the spicy beef the husband ordered a 10 pizza with sausage pepperoni bacon and ham and i ordered the burger with cheese mayo provolone cheese and bbq sauce my husband gave the pizza a 7 out of 10 and my burger was just above average it satisfied my burger craving so that s a plus
4545,had such a delightful time discovering gus and his amazing food truck delicious food and felt like i was unlocking a mystery learning how to order and line up
4546,wings were good but i don t like the service 4 teenagers worker without any adult it the worker jockeying very loud and in their phone all the time i was there it was unprofessional if the owner really care about the business he need to be there or at least hire a manager
4547,wow the prices have really gone up in 5 months perhaps it wouldn t be so bad if they hadn t removed so many choices from the menu no lobster no dungeness crab
4548,the gyros are fabulous they were very tender the staff was very friendly we were looking for a place to eat and stumbled across this gem we travel a lot and we love to find places like this also the prices are very reasonable
4549,i wouldn t call a typical steakhouse it s avery unorthodox version of a steakhouse however that s what makes it great it s a cute place that you can get a good steak from i have been here a few times and decided that i should probably write a review the food is amazing i typically get my steak oscar style or i ll go for the surf and turf it s a constant battle for me deciding which i want because they are both so good the service has been consistent i ve never had a bad thing to say it s unlike your typical steakhouse but it s worth the try two very enthusiastic thumbs up
4550,we love burger up one of the first elevated burger places in nashville burger up always has us coming back for several years the marathon burger is the best burger and veg friendly great service and delicious beers and cocktails what more could you want
4551,the quality of work meets my expectations but the wait is often longer than i am willing to wait so you ve gotta go when you don t have somewhere to be afterwards
4552,great service i m really happy with how my nails turned out the staff was professional and courteous
4553,i d like to add many more stars to my rating this is my absolute favorite wine bar in st louis city or county there s nothing else that comes close to the charm and atmosphere of this fabulous find in south city the building is over 100 years old djiana the owner is very knowledgable about wines and foods and can always recommend a wine that suits both my husband and i she s never been wrong the balkan platter and stuffed dates are my favorite appetizers as well as all of the flatbreads djiana is always creating new appetizers and foods that immediately become a hit with her customers
4554,delicious plus bottomless mimosas the fried cheese epic great environment nice cool decor
4555,be sure to have quarters for the parking meters if dining here as i found no free parking in the area the restaurant is attractive and comfortable and the city of media charming the staff members did not go out of their way to make me feel welcome or appreciated but plates were cleared and my water glass was refilled the lunch buffet 9 95 is a small selection of tasty items mostly chicken dishes missing from the buffet was a staple indian dish my favorite cauliflower and potatoes aloo gobi there is a small salad bar which includes good rice pudding kheer the chicken tandoori was not hot nor as succulent as i have enjoyed at other indian establishments
4556,the hubby and i are from out of town and stopped by here for a quick lunch before we headed to the airport the first thing that i noticed was the beautiful patio with brightly colored flowers and lots of seating how fun to come hang out with friends to eat drink and watch the game the interior is very clean and well kept we were greeted right away and sat immediately marianne was our server and she was super friendly and attentive the manager theresa even came by and chatted with us for a bit the entire staff seems really pleasant we ordered the steak quesadilla for an appetizer adult grilled cheese and nachos all of it was delicious the steak quesadilla was a recommendation by our server and we were not disappointed the black bean and corn salsa it came with was amazing the adult grilled cheese had the perfect palatable balance with the gouda cheese and apples combined with bacon on sourdough the nachos are huge definitely recommend getting it to share the pork carnitas added to it was really flavorful i loved that there wasn t just topping on the first layer of chips but ingredients were spread all throughout the giant mound all in all we had a great experience this seems like it would be such a great place to come hang out with friends and watch the game there were lots of tvs with a variety of sports featured on it but it wasn t overwhelming like some places with tvs can feel theresa told us about their happy hour specials and we wish we lived closer great place and will be back when we come into town
4557,absolutely love this place i arrived right before they opened sorry at like 950 the woman i think the owner was so nice and had great energy i got a spicy tuna bowl and a juice and both were amazing and the bowl was substantial for a size small this place is definitely a cute little hidden gem it s drive through only which i kinda like it was a little difficult maneuvering my car but worth it definitely will be back to try an aa bowl
4558,luke s has been a go to in nola for the past ten years it reminds me of a parisian brasserie and is centrally located in the central business district our last visit to luke s was fair the service was excellent as always but the food seemed rather uninspired we had their house gumbo along with fresh and fried oysters but the other menu items i cannot even recall days later luke s a place you can stop in for a burger and a beer or oysters and a cocktail the food s solid and the atmosphere upscale,we cannot day enough great things about our experience at loa we sat at the bar and were treated like royalty by adam i hope i remembered his name correctly we tried several fabulous cocktails and met interesting people to talk and pass the time with i cannot wait to go back
4559,largest book selection lots of children s books older books cleft notes and new books and nice kittys
4560,my favorite hang out for food and ambiance speak some french outdoors it does not get better than that
4561,this restaurant is fantastic it s an authentic italian experience the service was impeccable the food was delicious we were served by andreas he was professional hilarious and kept us very happy
4562,this is one of the coolest hidden gems in nashville the cocktails are extraordinary and the bar tenders are so cool the interior and architecture of this bar makes for an amazing atmosphere i will absolutely be back especially when i need to impress friends with a cool spot to get drinks
4563,i had a wonderful experience with camden bay we ve moved in recently and already feel like home all they staff were very nice and friendly yariana patiently helped me and my wife through every step of the enrollment i m so thankful for that i definitely recommend this place

4586,love ly food and attentive service i had a strawberry puree cocktail which was very refreshing a fried duck leg with a cabbage salad and charred peaches which was utterly good a risotto pecorino cheese black kale meyer lemon rind and fried kale delicious albeit too salty due to a generous helping of pecorino but still and the consistency was perfect and for dessert a single serving cast iron pie sour cream batter with sweet plum and a scoop of ginger honey ice cream a very nice chaud froid ending for the meal
4587,we just spent the weekend at the hyatt regency at the arch we loved it close to the arch within a very short walking distance beautiful room with spectacular view of the arch great sports bar with craft beer and very friendly bartender we experienced a few glitches that the staff was very quick to resolve and compensate us for especially sara from the room service and laura rommel front office manager what wonderful customer service these ladies presented we would highly recommend this hotel and we will come back for many visits in the future
4588,no attention grabber or witty introduction here just some amazing pasta i came to moto with some friends for a bachelorette party we arrived early and got drinks at the bar while we waited but were still seated on time our waiter was friendly and helpful with menu suggestions all of the pasta i tried was unbelievable definitely house made fresh and somebody knows what they re doing all of the drinks i tried were great unique and summery i wanted to explore their wine deals selections a little more but we were going to bars afterwards and i knew i wouldn t be having wine there don t miss the accompaniments for the bread they cost extra but otherwise you don t get anything served with the bread they will bring you more so ask for it i would love to come back here to have more of their heavenly pasta ill just have to find an excuse to come back to nashville
4589,i love this place as it s one of the few with the french bistro feel in the lou the beignets were hot and fresh but some raw dough in the middle don t inhale or you ll choke on the powdered sugar if ordered a burger with bacon and egg as my dish and we also had lattes which were kind of light for my taste maybe too much milk i enjoy the ambiance here and the fries get fries and mussels if you like mussels very nice server and accommodated our toddler with the kids proof cup i m big on this now i want to eat out at nice places with my child so being offered a high chair automatically is a new rubric for me on service
4590,awesome soup and sandwich perfect place for a cocktail and lighter meal recommend for sure
4591,very good sushi for all you can eat sushi wasn t crowded at all lots of choices to select from we will be back
4592,oh schlafly i remember when you were owned by tom schlafly you were full of life then you did innovative things with you beers and you did them well you were a creative restauranteur you had a menu with interesting tasty selections for four pages not the two sided narrow piece of plastic laminate franchise quality flavored grease food your restaurant now sells your beers are still good no doubt the new owner bought your brewing recipes in the sale but your brewing competition in the st louis brewing community is at least your equal now in selling your company to people who obviously know nothing about brewing or restauranting tom schlafly has replaced the art of the daring brew restauranteur with passive soulless investors willing to phone in the spirit of a once great st louis business story three stars for the beer alone
4593,the absolute best service and quality the cutest little place to take the family quiet tons to do and nice and clean we will be back
4594,the hottest dive bar on this side of the city who would have thought it s a blast and the bartenders are great and pour heavy lol
4595,highly recommend this place if you re in the mood for some good indian cuisine great service to top it off will federal be back here whenever i am in the phili area
4596,last night we celebrated stephanie s rehearsal dinner at barone s it is situated right next to a dry cleaners with an outdoor patio to its left first impression it was a rustic feel with an open restaurant feel byob we had a party of 25 and were nestled in a beautiful area in the back of the restaurant equipped with a soda fountain and long table set up for the adult beverages first was a pasta course penne in vodka sauce and one in red sauce served family style then came the pasta in a vinaigrette dressing with their homemade bread the bread was warm and fantastic each table had their own olive oil with red pepper flakes salt pepper and parm cheese the options were chicken marsala chicken parm and salmon they came with garlic mash and green beans the entrees were nothing special i really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service i would come back here for a sit down meal with the lady
4597,great time for our group 11 am tour sat 31 march 2018 it was most informative i had taken the standard free tour before but going behind the scenes to find out more on a b s history helped make this tour worthwhile the tour guide was most informative the free sample glass and replica 1880 sample token were nice perks as was the sample of budweiser drunk from said glass and the free beer after the tour learning more on the history of a b and seeing examples of their advertising over the years was very good i greatly enjoyed this tour and would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in beer and in a b
4598,we went when devour downtown fringe and colts game letting out were all going on the staff handled it great was friendly and made our wait pleasant the food was amazing we ordered several tapas shared and filled us up definitely looking forward to going back
4599,the food was delicious i ordered the chicken fried steak comes with eggs potatoes and toast so many carbs exactly what i needed and a pancake that i m taking home service was amazing and she definitely deserved the 10 tip bill was 20 i always love coming here
4600,yum this is a great place to go with a few friends to share their delicious and nicely portioned cheese while enjoying a beer from their extensive drink list 5 stars purely because of how much i loved their cheese selection and appreciated the staff s knowledge of each cheese i d happily go back although this is not a place i d go to have inexpensive drinks
4601,service was outstanding the american trainers just left and it s obvious they are good at their jobs our server sharon was charming and always coming back to our table to make sure we were comfortable the calamari is the best i ve had in the city and the shrimpers heaven was literally heaven my girlfriend who is not a seafood fan found more than enough variety on the menu and the deserts are perfect i honestly can t understand how anyone can give this place a negative review based on my experience i hope this place is here to stay
4602,we got the unlimited car wash package and it s so worth it the car wash gets the job done it even have sweet lights while you re going through free vacuum with car wash
4603,we hosted our son and daughter in law s rehearsal dinner for 60 people at the montecito wine bistro it was fabulous and the food was amazing we were from out of town and did not even see the restaurant until the day before darren the manager was great to work with and was very helpful during the entire process thank you montecito wine bistro for a perfect evening
4604,we arrived early and had our room ready all great on that front however parking later after dinner was tricky this lot lacks space for larger vehicles or trailers so some folks took 3 spots and there really is not that kind of space available the staff was very nice at both check in and check out the next morning this place is ideal if you are visiting usf mosi or busch gardens literally within less of a mile of each plenty of food options in the area too why 4 stars here s the major issue the walls are paper thin between the rooms and the hallway every sound made by others can be heard in your room this included the crib aged infant crying loudly at 2am or the kids laughing and talking at 8am inside their rooms given that checkout is later in the morning i would have loved to enjoyed the comfy bed later than 8am huge negative for me otherwise the stay was okay for my one night visit in the tampa area
4605,i m 100 biased to any giordano s location that provides the same flavor and experience i m used to growing up in illinois this location checked enough boxes to make me happy the service was friendly and informative the fried cheese curds were on point the meat and more meat pizza was fantastic i don t plan to be in indianapolis at this location ever again but if it s an option imma take it in a heartbeat
4606,our friends who reside in wayne took us here for dinner and since the food was on display my wife had to have a taste of everything the portions were large taste was yummy and the service was great we were able to meet paola herself and her daughter served us with constant check in s and served brought us homemade dessert
4607,consistency is what this place is about always friendly staff especially bob great clean cool waiting area very fair pricing and overall quality experience the few times i ve been
4608,i guess the name refers to actual musical horns but i always think of the joe hill book when i hear this either way it s great food service is excellent and the food is well worth the wait friendly waitress who gave good advice as we tried to decide between temptations my soon is gluten free and they have a gf waffle that will make you slug yourself in the face with a bag of silver dollars and wood screws pro tip don t go if you re in a rush as it can take a bit for the food to arrive but you won t be disappointed will return
4609,this hotel has excelled beyond my wildest dreams when it comes to service i realized after i was in my room for the night that i had forgotten to pick up distilled water for my cpap machine when i inquired where the closest drug store was they offered to pick it up for me i am amazed and delighted by their service and friendliness while i m at it the room is very comfortable and pleasant too
4610,cute beach side watery the bad is that there s no parking for this restaurant so you have to find public parking and walk the food was good we ordered the chicken sandwich and grouper sandwich i had a coconut mojo to that was very good too i would come back
4611,had a great first time experience here food was good we ordered the bronze salmon steak and two pizzas we got brussel sprouts and a little dutch oven bread thing for appetizers which were good but i felt the brussels were a bit drenched in sauces but everyone at my table loved them the waitress was excellent very friendly and attentive
4612,we would have liked to eat in the dining room so inviting beautiful but did the hotel room service since we have our dog with us this was not only the best hotel room service meal we ve had in years the bar is usually pretty low on that but the best meal we ve had in years soooo delish i had the hanger steak my husband had the rigatoni highly recommend sorry to see the previous negative review from last night sounds like they had a bad off night with staffing all i know is our experience tonite was exceptional
4613,the hemingway cuban was to die for and the yucca fries with garlic aioli were better than any french fry i ve ever had can t wait to go back and try the cuban salchipapa and tres leches cake service was good
4614,paradice has super tasty shaved iced and great vibes inside the store definitely would recommend
4615,ordered the hash w chicken and over easy eggs at first i was a little skeptical of the price but it was delicious and filling totally reccomend for brunch yummy
4616,got my food to go through grub hub no problems and food was made quickly they have a whole lot of vegetarian options very delicious fresh and filling
4617,this place is a must for brunch in nashville we came on a saturday morning around 10 30 on the day of a massive taylor swift concert and there was quite the line and an hour and a half wait for 2 people for a table however they have a bar area you can sit at and order your food at i believe any age can so we just waited by the bar until a couple left we only had to wait like 20 30 minutes the service was great and the food was excellent they originally brought one of us the wrong dish but quickly took it back and replaced it with the right one within 5 minutes our server at the bar named sam was really nice highly recommend
4618,i m happy to see amato brothers has reopened after being closed for 2 yrs after the fire considering they ve just reopened i will give them some time to get things straightened out i placed a take out order for an eggplant parmesan sandwich and got chicken parmesan also ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich with sharp provolone with nothing else on it and got a chicken cutlet hoagie both sandwiches were good but not what was ordered will still continue to order from here but hopefully will get what i order
4619,my husband and i ate here today it was so good it wasn t our original plan to stop there but the business across the street was out of oysters oyster house so we decided to go to landry s wonderful and friendly staff the food was amazing the oysters we had were spot on what we wanted it was our last stop before heading out of town i forgot our waitresses name but she was great very friendly we also got the bananas fosters cake for 13 it s a huge piece and so good thanks landry s we will be back
4620,i am 61 years old and have had a life time of sitting in a dentist chair not fun i had an abscessed tooth and made an appt with dr kern at the plymouth meeting office the receptionists were very professional and extremely pleasant dr kern pulled my two teeth to get ready for my implants i didn t feel a thing he gave wonderful needles pain free i just got back from my follow up appt today and was very impressed with the speed of timing i didn t even sit in the waiting room i was taken right into the treatment room and dr kern was there asap looking forward to the rest of my procedures as it really was a pleasant experience considering the not so pleasant situation i would highly recommend this office for any oral surgery i have had other surgeries prior to this and this office by far was excellent in comparison
4621,great car wash a lot of car washes like this just push the dirt to the back of the car but this place gets all sides clean the vacuums are really powerful and they have different size nozzles so you can use one for your mats and a smaller one to get in between the seats plus they have covers over the parking spaces so you re not directly in the sun the owner was there and he was very friendly and helpful will definitely be returning
4622,went with a large group and the service was decent i ordered the swedish pancakes but the waitress gave me the wrong one i didn t realize it until another person who ordered swedish pancakes got theirs which looks way different than mine they mistakenly gave me blueberry pancakes it was too late to argue because i was already half way done eating it i was hungry overall the food tasted average not really worth waiting in line i would recommend other diners if u don t want to wait in line
4623,nice people pleasant and clean space very minimal no changing room you change in the treatment room reasonable prices massage was a good massage sorry i forgot my masseur s name if i return to philly i will probably come back here
4624,so fabulous we had the fried chicken and waffles amazing all white breast meat delicious home made whip cream also had the pulled roast beef benedict with debris and mornay sauce over fresh biscuits the best of everything drinks and service was great get a table on the front patio
4625,this is a restaurant that reminds me of little cafes i used to go to growing up they offer a wide variety of food generous portions and are very reasonably priced we are there for lunch but i d like to go back and try breakfast next time
4626,unique donut flavors and delicious breakfast sandwiches district donuts is a quirky restaurant with yummy breakfast options the donut flavors change regularly so don t get too attached to a specific flavor i have yet to try their sliders but have heard good things
4627,traditions in place i want to love this place i watched it grow from ground up as a longtime native el charro was the place to take visitors and to just get yummy mexican this is the 5th time here with lackluster results salsa has lost the yummy factor chili rellenos lacking any real flavor etc for beans even chips if the goal is to reach out to the general tourist public this is the p ace i will say house margaritas are delicious and service is spot on
4628,it s a very casual and cheap lunch there is never a wait and the food is exactly like the other franchises in ohio we like to stop by here after a trip to the beach for a few hot dogs covered with chili and cheese the service is always quick so it s perfect if you have a tired tired kids with you and are really hungry,the park has a great playground and a cute splash pad there are family friendly private bathrooms next to splash pad but unfortunately most of seating for the parents around the splash pad and playground are in the sun there are shady places around them so bringing your own folding chair would be good if you plan on staying awhile my two year old played there for 3 hours between the splash pad and playground and would have stayed longer if i let her the playground and splash pad are in the same enclosure so water shoes would also be a good idea bc the pavement around the playground gets hot i do like that they are enclosed so my kid is confined that one area the playground does have different age sections for toddlers to older kids
4629,my favorite breakfast place in tampa i have a gluten allergy and they have gluten free bread i ordered a cheddar cheese omelette with gluten free bread and fruits it was perfect my husband ordered a fried chicken benedict even though its not on menu they made it and he loved it we will start coming here on a regular basis
4630,try the bouquet tea tonics they re delicious the mochas are also very yummy and the artwork on top of the mocha is cool the lavender latte was awesome too if you re in reno don t miss it
4631,i didn t want to leave my stay at the saint was excellent every staff member was extremely friendly and eager to help the best customer service i ve received in a very long time i was there to celebrate my birthday ky one of the staff members we met upon check in surprised me with a complimentary bottle of champagne when we returned to the room after dinner i was so grateful for the thoughtfulness everyone was so upbeat and cordial the saint definitely gets 5 stars for customer service alone the location was perfect there s a beautiful restaurant and stylish bar within the location but it s located in the heart of the french quarter so there are many other bars and restaurants in the vicinity the decor is stunning i loved the play on good vs evil i loved the blue lit hallways and the photos on the room doors upon entrance into the room the light was heavenly i enjoyed the brightness and touches of blue to break up the white the room was light and airy meticulously clean the bed was full of fluffy pillows and the mattress had the perfect balance of softness and firmness my overall experience with the saint was amazing i highly recommend this hotel i can t wait to stay there again
4632,not much to add in regards to what you re going to find here based on other reviews just want to say great value for what you get and my wife and i are hooked
4633,my girlfriend and i went here for our anniversary and we couldn t have been more pleased with our experience the food was great and the portions were larger than we expected the food seemed like it was great quality so it was worth the price drinks were also great the service had to be the best part of earl s the waiter was very nice and knowledgeable and we didn t have to wait long for service at all and he would check on us enough to know we weren t forgotten the most unexpected part of the night was when my girlfriend asked the hostess for a picture and said we wanted it for our one year anniversary she stopped everything and asked if we told the waiter and we said no she said we should have mentioned it and took it upon herself to make sure she let the kitchen know and gave us a complimentary cake for our celebration we didn t expect this at all and were very appreciative of their kindness we will definitely be going back and we recommend this place for anyone
4634,so i ve tried quite a few hair salons around the city i ve had the devacut a few times and i still felt unsatisfied i am east asian with curly and mildly coarse hair it s thick dense and i have a lot of it heather helped me out by using the ouidad method i kept most of my length and i feel a ton lighter styling is a lot easier and i can go longer in between washes because of it the difference is dramatic between devacut and ouidad i also find it a lot more affordable i m totally sold
4635,they are a little pricey the food was mediocre at best it s not a place i would be in rush to to eat again however i would eat again because of the service the ladies were very nice and engaging
4636,the food was excellent and the staff was extremely courteous and friendly i highly recommend this to all my family and friends
4637,a typical take out place in south philly for the price the food is a great deal i normally order their regular rolls but their speciality rolls are yummy as well free delivery on order over 10 i also tried their tofu teriyaki not as many veggies as i would have liked but it too is a great deal for the price if you live in south philly i would definitely give this place a try
4638,nothing bittersweet about this establishment an absolute treasure in the warehouse district the almond petit four and red velvet cheesecake were insanely delicious and i would go back every day if i could i also had an iced almond milk latte and it beat the chain coffee places the cakes looked wonderful and the staff was super friendly go check it out you won t be disappointed
4639,went for friday night italian dinner feast bring a group of friends to eat drink byob and be merry so much food and you can ask for a box to bring some home with you too they dance between course which is entertaining it s loud so it may be hard for older adults to hear they change their menu each season try them all fun for out of town wars because it s a 3 hour affair
4640,initially when we drove by we had doubts about coming here since there were a lot of people waiting outside and we were starving we put our name on the list and were told it would be about a 45 minute wait however it only ended up being a 15 minute wait score the place is pretty small since it is basically in a house i got the stuffed banana foster french toast which was amazing the bread was not your standard sliced bread but homemade he got the crab meat omelette which was full of flavor and super savory we would definitely order both of them again not too mention the service was super fast total time spent there including the wait was probably less than an hour
4641,love this place cinnamon swirl pancakes are amazing great addition to ch employees are super sweet and always nice to my toddler the service is a little slow at times but i appreciate the care and thoughtfulness that goes into my order and into the service i always come here when i want a real breakfast with a side of kindness
4642,i waited a couple days before rating to try to be fair this place was recommended and hyped separately to me and my husband in transit and upon arrival to nashville we expected a lot the service was great we sat at the bar both bartenders and food service were polite and attentive drink selection and quality and price seemed good the food is another story it is over priced and over hyped by reviewers my husband had the oz pot pie even with a healthy dose of the curry sauce it was dry and plain could barely taste the curry i had korean short rib tacos nothing korean about them i tasted sriracha and soy sauce isn t korean about gochujang meat was dry the fries are house cut plentiful and phenomenal but the rest of the menu is overpriced ignorance
4643,i have never had a bad meal at meadows i have come here since i was little and would order the miss piggy every time ravioli eventually i graduated to a bigger portion of ravioli i love their pasta and sauce it s obviously not gourmet but it does taste good my mom is a fan of their gyros and my dad seems to love their seafood platters the salad bar is always stocked and has a decent variety of topping and their soups are phenomenal i always try to go on days when they re serving cream of broccoli because it is by far the best soup i ve ever had the breakfast they serve is also reasonably priced and always a decent portion their omelets are what i usually go for and they are always full of flavor and very large they also have french toast and belgian waffles with ice cream which is my guilty pleasure on fat days the place is a little dated i don t think the decor has ever changed since i began coming here almost 20 years ago it also has a strange odor that seems to be stuck from years ago when they had a smoking and non smoking section it never seems dirty just a different smell i don t think i ve ever had bad service from here the waiters and waitresses do seem to be juggling many tables and may take a while to get to you but they re all for the most part extremely friendly
4644,this is an interesting place all of its coffee is from k cups but mine still tasted fine my issue is that it is so environmentally harmful however that aside this is a good place to make a quick stop for coffee or to buy in bulk the owner is very nice and helpful we had a great conversation i wish that there was seating so i could have stayed longer however the price is fantastic and i liked being able to customize the strength of my coffee
4645,unbelievably moist and delicious cake in whatever beautiful design you request they have made three cakes for me in the last month this is my go to cake shop hands down
4646,fresh and delicious seafood at the pier can t leave santa barbara without having a meal here the establishment is small with about 4 tables outside and a few inside with the beach view and of course there are counter seats facing the open kitchen best view in my eyes we were famished by the time we got there so we took the first available seating which was at the counter we saw how the seafood was hand picked literally and prepared service was very attentive as our orders was taken right away food came out fast and the hotel that we stayed at milo hotel gave us a complimentary clam chowder order for this place it was definitely put to good use the clam chowder came in a cup not in the bread bowl it was more than enough as an appetizer and tasted so good for our entrees we had the rock crab special and the calamari sandwich both orders came with a side of cole slaw and union rings i am a big seafood lover so getting my hands dirty for that delicious crab was so well worth it the crab was a little smaller than expected but super fresh and delicious the calamari sandwich was also good the seafood quality here is unbelievable for the price i can t wait to come back the next time i m in sb already craving my crab clam chowder drools
4647,spendy maybe a bit too spendy for everyday eats but the fresh out of the oven pita dry aged ribeye and the fatteh were something special definitely give it a try
4648,kept driving by this place and decided to try it out highly recommended clean professional and healthy fast food prices are normal perfect if you are in a hurry or looking for a quick bite
4649,i went in and had the andes mint cupcake hoping that my favorite mint chocolate combination would not let me down it didn t let me down but the chocolate cake was bland and not very chocolaty the whipped topping was bland as well and not even very sweet the cupcakes were overflowing out of the wrapper and the filling was not very minty overall i wasn t super stoked but i was a good cupcake
4650,excellent breakfast we asked for several changes eggs medium bacon and hash browns extra crispy biscuits instead of toast pecan pancakes instead of plain and everything came out just as we wanted the pecan pancakes were flavorful sweet fluffy and packed with pecans our waiter was friendly and gave us great service with a smile try this out when you are in the french quarter
4651,st louis institution lovely atmosphere and they have butterscotch mmm friendly and fast service and a great spot to people watch
4652,the food here is great along with the service the breakfast was affordable and very filling while the lunch selection is very good and believe it or not it s good for you at least alot better than a regular burger joint if you can find another place that serves grass fed organic meat let me know but untill then this is the place to go

4660,food at sabrina s is imaginative and well prepared four of us had dinner here on a friday night it was a bit crowded but we found room at our table a kailua pork sandwich a grilled chicken panini and 2 thai noodle bowls were ordered the noodle bowls were huge and delicious filled with fresh chopped veggies and covered with a steaming beef bone broth the pork sandwich was saucy and flavorful served with a spicy slaw that complimented the sweet pork while i usually taste every dish that comes to the table i passed on the chicken sandwich because i didn t want to share my husbands cold he said the sandwich was good but due to his cold there wasn t much more embellishment i could get from him for dessert we ordered both desserts that were offered my favorite was the key lime tart served in a mason jar it had a delicious oat and coconut crumb crust on the bottom and the key lime had the perfect tartness to it the dessert was served with fresh whipped cream and lime zest hands down the most delicious dessert i have had out in many moons our second dessert was a home made snickers it consisted of a very dense chocolate brownie layered with carmel peanuts and cream even with three of us eating it we only got half way through it and it served as a great midnight snack the server was very good she was personable but not over whelming she was attentive to our needs and help made our dinning experience a positive one sophie made the rounds and answered all of our questions and add the personal touch to our evening next time i m through reno i will definitely return the reason i gave this restaurant four stars and not five was that i do like to see the use of organic produce and meats i m pretty sure if that was the case she wouldn t be able to keep her prices as reasonable as they are now

4677,first time i went here one of the barbers gave me a pretty stressful time with a bad cut and attitude however reuben stepped in and took care of the situation very well i ve been going to different barbers around philly and most of them either take shortcuts and lower the quality and art of a good cut reuben has a very low key chill environment that i like and it s easy to feel welcome here i often travel around but after my 2nd time here i m going to go back for my future cuts reuben pays attention to details and is careful with cuts which is very important especially when other barbers use machines like crazy and bruise you up
4678,fast delicious friendly staff clean nice atmosphere generous portions and a number of options for a reasonable price
4679,the beer here is exceptional we drove here a couple times first to try waaievatsf ipa and it is absolutely delicious but the second time we drove there was yesterday and what we saw when we got there was unbelievable there was a line literally a quarter mile long and if they have employees who tend the lines that s how long it is one of their employees gave my girlfriend the finger because of a misunderstanding all in all great brewery great beer that s mostly what matters

4692,this is one of my favorite mexican restaurants in the tampa bay area the mole chick enchilada was the best i ve ever had flavorful with just the right balance of sweet and spice the soup of the day was a tomatillo carnita full of meat and yummy veggies hopefully they offer it on the menu regularly prices might seem high but the food is rich yummy and amply portioned service is friendly and knowledgeable,great vibe with many locals and friendly service mussels four different styles try the russian style with a rich vodka cream sauce and only 12 for a huge portion its supposed to be a steak place and they do have a wide selection of steaks the atmosphere is more of a local bar and i didn t try the steaks although i just might come back for the steak and more mussels
4693,the birds nest is everything so new orleans featuring local coffee and snacks they serve amazing french truck iced coffee and this king cake season they have dong phuong vietnamese king cakes if you haven t had them i can not recommend it enough also the morning cheese grits are a great start to any day dont miss out on this place i promise its a gem
4694,very happy with my recent dinner at harry izzy s i have recently decided that i have to stop giving 5 star reviews unless the food is off the charts too many yelpers throw the 5 star and even the 1 star review out there a bit too freely not realizing the consequences of either creating an over or underrated restaurant lets just say h i s is a solid 4 star restaurant the shrimp cocktail is as advertised if you need your sinuses cleared then give it a go wife had the filet and said it was of the best steaks she has had in a while i had the strip izzy s style it was perfectly cooked and nicely crusted but the sauce was just a tad to sweet for me still ate it all dessert was brownie sundae nothing special and should have probably gone with the woodford s bread pudding a touch pricey but cheaper than high end steakhouses all in all a great meal
4695,love boat is very nice i really enjoy this place definitely want to come to try other stuffs too
4696,the food here is always excellent and the drinks are fantastic however i have been here on several occasions and the service has been questionable all times be prepared for slower slightly strange service but a great meal
4697,our tour guide was michael and he was amazing he was enthusiastic and very kind he made it a point to make sure everyone could hear and see him during presentation time he taught us so much about new orleans history it was really interesting to hear all the stories meeting the voodoo bone lady at the end of the night was a like a cherry on top of an ice cream sundae she was very sweet and we were able to see the inside of her shop
4698,every time we are in the clearwater area we visit this place the shrimp and grits are amazing best i ve ever had on our last visit we also tried the steak bowl very tasty as well the drinks are ok as in most places in the area they aren t strong we come here for the food and great service so they get 5 starts
4699,we discovered this laotian restaurant through yelp while visiting our family so we decided to give it a try the look of the restaurant from outside was deceiving where we almost left after we arrived because of the location parking situation and my fear of not being used to the type of surroundings when we walked in we were surprised by how warm cozy clean filled with customers and we were greeted and seated promptly it didn t take long for us to get our food and the food was very reasonable we ordered the sticky rice chicken larb papaya salad beef jerky stick rice mango dessert and all we delicious we enjoyed all but probably will not order the sticky rice mango dessert again for 8 although we didn t mind paying for it considering the cost of how much it would have taken for them to make it but it was just a little too watering for us we would definitely do it again next time we visit philadelphia since we don t have any laotian restaurants in tampa area i would highly recommend this place for anyone who likes to try authentic laotian food that cannot be found from thai restaurants this was the first laotian restaurant we have ever been to and we truly enjoyed the laotian unique food experience p s byob is a plus
4700,my family s first trip to nashville and heard this was the place to stay but i am disappointed i did not upgrade to a better room and regret it we had an exterior room over looking a rock roof and partition parking lot it was older and poorly lite just depressing the highlight was the abundance of food options looking forward to a visit in the future with new water park
4701,food 4 service 5 ambiance 4 when everyone of the 16 guests leave happy restaurant needs to be commended our glasses were constantly refilled we were being checked on from time to time for our drinks appetizer and entree full marks on service i the flip side the food is brought out as it gets ready and no separate checks are entertained for appetizer we got the combination platter with hummus red pepper hummus and eggplant mash also got falafel and saganaki the falafel was a little underdone and hummus tasted very different from usual definitely the cuisine is not authentic greek but unique adaptation i was satisfied with my blacked tilapia and dh got lamb chops on the table people loved the lamb gyros lamb kabobs and pesto pasta the chicken gyros were very ordinary the dessert of bread pudding was stellar though and my cocktail medusa was nice and sweet although weak there was a pleasant belly dancer who kept us entertained we will be back
4702,i recently discovered that i m gluten sensitive which makes eating anywhere else but home very difficult for the most part i have sacrificed enjoying a meal out with family because eating something with even a risk of cross contamination isn t worth it because i feel horrible afterward i was thrilled when i found out about new day here in st louis at our first visit we tried the lasagna biscuits and gravy cheesecake and a brownie yes you can order breakfast and dinner at the same time of day and they were all very good my husband doesn t have a gluten restriction and he loved everything as well i m excited about ordering some sweets and freshly baked breads and having them shipped to my home what a nice option
4703,food sushi is always consistent great portions prices are very fair service however is a hit or a miss there s one girl there who s always a pleasure to be under the rest of them makes you feel like a burden they ignore you on purpose if conversation behind the sushi bar is interesting
4704,i rarely leave reviews but this is my new fave place its not your typical greasy pizza place they actually have some healthy options and get this the healthy options actually taste good gasp i dined in when they were just 3 days old and the decor is eye catching but not distracting more importantly the food is phenomenal i order takeout about once sometimes twice oops a week i have not had a bad meal yet i m working on trying different things on the menu but i have a few staples already their hand cut jersey fries the mild wings and the crust and fire bowl i had their truffle burger last week and it was amazing i ve become a regular customer very quickly i love this place
4705,long wait 1 and 1 2 hours on a saturday around 11 am but we walked around town and did the photos of the angel wings down around the corner while waiting great coffees and yummy breakfast items i had mushroom and goat cheese ricotta egg sandwich it came with fruit or home fried potatoes it s not a quiet place but very good foodie type food and drinks
4706,this place is awesome always friendly service and food is on point talk about teamwork they work together to take care of the customers more restaurants need to model this place it takes us 45 min to get here well worth the drive
4707,stayed here on a business trip and was very pleasantly surprised when i arrived the service was above and beyond i arrived around 11 am and they allowed me to check in right away even though standard check in isn t until around 3 pm or so the room was very clean and had cute decor they also send you a text after you check in to see if there is anything else you need for your room the location is also awesome you are within walking distance to a variety of restaurants bars historic sites i would definitely stay here again if i am in the area note hotel is pet friendly
4708,michael and chris were great it was easy to book the tour and the michael took us out on a tour we saw dolphins homes see life and spent time exploring an island i can t wait for the next time we visit clearwater i will certainly take the tour again keep in mind that if you are a beginning jet skier let them know so they can put you with other beginners
4709,i made an appointment online at the last minute and the process was quick and easy i ended up having my hair cut by cameron and she did a fantastic job not only did she explain to me how certain hairstyles would work for my hair texture she even took the time explaining how to style my hair with the new cut on top of all of that cameron was incredibly personable and we talked the entire time she made me feel comfortable right away it was an amazing experience and i absolutely loved the haircut i walked out with highly recommend cameron and this salon because they were so professional and easy to work with

4711,the food here was so delicious there is no doubt that i will be returning there were four of us when we went here and next time i want to get two more to join because there was so much food i couldn t finish it all they give you a towel for your lap and you can take as much bread as you want the whole meal is eaten with the bread and your hands if you split the bill with everyone the price isn t bad at all also amazing atmosphere can t wait to go back

4717,great the service is fast and the drinks are great i would highly recommend the snow smoothies and popping boba but when look for the flavors for boba it s not on the main menu it s on a chalk board below it
4718,you re in nola and looking for somewhere to hang out away from the chaos of bourbon street have a great cocktail and listen to jazz look no further than just across the street from acme oyster this is a really small and intimate bar with great drinks and you re just a few feet away from the music we happened to walk right in and sit at a table and listen to jazz just as the musicians were setting up had some really good drinks from their speciality drinks and listened to some classic jazz favorites really enjoyed it
4719,this place is a real deal my son has multiple food allergies going to restaurant is so stressful our server rose she went above and beyond to make a custom menu just for my son she made sure what he could have and they came up with a meal not on menu made sure that there was no cross contamination he enjoyed his meal we had such a peaceful stressless happy family dinner our food was excellent the staff in general are very pleasant but rose is very hardworking and passionate server who loves her job and takes it very serious this will be a place that we will be visiting often specially for my son with food allergies thankyou
4720,this is the best sports bar and restaurant you can go to in wesley chapel located on the second floor of florida hospital center ice it overlooks rink b and rink d like any sports bar you can watch any sport on any of the many tv s they have you can also watch hockey figure skating curling public skating in person while dining or having a drink then if all of that watching gets you motivated you can go and do it at the same place there is a full bar including many craft beers and the owners very own tap of 81bay s beers there is also many other local tampa brews on tap as for the food many are surprised that this is not your average sports food there is a nice diversity and there are many healthy options and divulgent options too for any diet or preference the food may take a bit longer wait than expected but that is only because almost everything is made fresh from scratch in the kitchen there is a snack bar owned by the same owners downstairs in the rink if you are more in a hurry their menu has influences like ybor city for the ybor eggrolls canadian hockey traditional poutine dishes and a tampa bay lightning bleu burger they have a small kids menu and the whole restaurant including the bar is kid friendly the chef is an amazing person who sometimes comes out to talk to customers as are all the staff including the owners bartenders hostess servers and kitchen staff they also cater and are very patient and accommodating to any problems or special requests i highly recommend this restaurant make sure to stop by if you are looking for something more fun exciting and authentic than a chain restaurant can provide you
4721,cookies are da bomb i don t need to eat gluten free but if you do this place is amazing
4722,we had our 8 yr old daughters bday there i realize we probably picked peel time we felt rushed and it was very crowded our hostess maggy was so sweet and tried so hard our daughter enjoyed her day but it could have been handled better
4723,great people super fast service the food is amazing homemade potato bacon soup and homemade bread on a stellar sandwich this cafe is in the heart of historic downtown plant city and the setting is pure delight genuinely the best lunch i ve had in a very long time if you choose this place you won t be sorry i guarantee can you tell i enjoyed it go there
4724,my experience at carsmetics was excellent the staff was very responsive and professional had a very pleasant surprise when it was time to pay the bill found that the final cost came in less than the estimate due to the skill of their staff highly recommend this location for your repairs
4725,i ve been coming here for about four years and in that time have acquired two pairs of jeans a t shirt and a bandana i am highly impressed with the denim in particular it wears well holds its shape and has thoughtful design details such as the inside edge of the fly being trimmed and tacked down so it doesn t make a weird bunched up mess you have to remember to fix every time you zip your pants the staff has been on point in recommending the right denim to me after asking what my needs were as others have said it s feast or famine when you come in either the staff will be your bffs or you will feel invisible i don t take that kind of stuff personally and don t care to analyze whether it s intentional vs not caring enough to do the job well all to say if you need some help you aren t getting ask and you will receive on inventory issues sometimes it s frustrating when the perfect pair is sold out for months but given that this is a startup i guess it s to be expected they have some great flash sales so sign up for their emails another great way to save if their retail price point is too high is to look in consignment stores around nashville i always see a few pairs of i w when i m thrifting
4726,i got my first tattoo here recently i cant complain about anything we walked in they made me feel so comfortable i was very nervous i am a very jittery twitchy shaky person by nature but john was amazing so kind i am definitely coming back recommending this place to friends

4730,i ve visited costco locations in three different countries and you know what there really aren t that many differences each costco location has a good amount of bulk items along with some furniture clothing books and other items that one might want to buy i visited with a friend recently to mostly buy some grocery items and personal care items and we were in and out of the store in less than 15 minutes this location was very convenient it wasn t very busy we were there shortly after it opened my friend mentioned that it was usually much busier and while the parking lot had some ice and snow in it it was a pretty smooth shopping experience
4731,i ve been to ted drewes on numerous occasions i have enjoyed myself each and every time service is always with a smile the lines are often long but it is worth the wait the lines move fast too to date everything i ve tried has been great whenever i have guest visiting from out of town i make attempts to get them to try ted drewes they always enjoy it and if they visit me again they have to get more ted drewes before they leave
4732,my kids love coming here we re from out of town but come to tampa about 3 4x a year to visit my brother we ve done yearly passes every other year the kids always ask to come and love it as much as busch gardens they have blocks legos airplane building and launch center small rock climbing wall a free play indoor playground that is similar to an ant hill firefighter dress up water boats and more in the spring and summer months i ll pack their swim suits and let them play at the water foundation splash pad outside the building there is also a fun playground right outside the museum too we spend on average of 3 4 hours in the area in total with museum water foundation and playground sometimes there are special events in outside of the museum including outdoor ice rink in the winter bring snacks lunch and you can eat at the tables outside the museum parking garage right next to the museum is reasonable too 7 for the whole day if you re looking for something to entertain the kids check this museum out i ve always been surprised with the low rankings here on yelp because my kids 4 and 6 years old love it tip if loud noises and kids screaming bother you bring ear plugs
4733,love going to this pool the life guards are great the only issues i have with the place is that i wish they would enforce people showering before entering the pool keep on top of children without parent supervision that are acting out and clean the bathrooms change rooms more they get pretty gross they should hire someone full time to do this since the pools are now free and can get pretty crowded the life guards do not have time to do this
4734,one of bucks best double dipped dark chocolate covered pretzels just start the list of amazing treats
4735,this is my favorite pizza place in tucson great food great service relaxing atmosphere and did i mention the super stix you haven t lived until you ve tried the super stix
4736,great breakfast spot in a somewhat unexpected location the frittata is one of the best i ve ever had i only wish there was a little more seating as it can get cramped and crowded sometimes also not a fan of the mirrors by the back seating who wants to watch themselves eat the food is delicious though get takeout or go through the drive through
4737,i tried this place for dinner and it s simply delicious the staff greeted me with a smile as i walked in past closing hours yes your read it right i was driving across the country and was craving for indian food and found this store fairly close to the freeway 84 i called in and ordered goat curry delicious ever for take away and i was an hour away when i ordered i asked if they would still be open past closing hours and explained my situation the guy at the front patiently listened to what i was talking and said it s fine i could come pick up arrived 15 min past closing and guess what they were still open picked up my order and thanked them for their service enjoyed my meal and all set to drive next morning to my destination
4738,we were here on august 25 on a day trip to philadelphia at first there was a sign on the door be back in 5 min we almost went elsewhere but a few minutes later she came back interestingly we were not the only people waiting to get in i can understand why the woman who helped us was incredibly friendly and warm the prices were fine but the big draw is the customer service from reading the other reviews it looks like the woman who helped us is the owner and she s probably the only employee which explains why she has to close whenever she needs to take a lunch break her manner is direct which i think explains why some reviewers interpret her behavior as rude i think she s cool and i will come back the next time i m in philly
4739,great food and service they have some of the most tender beef i have ever had cooking on the grill was really fun and the staff would help when we were confused
4740,like this location for the convenience but i prefer the butler location same food but the atmosphere at butler is better this location is more like a place where you see and stop in whereas butler is more like a neighborhood feel however the service here esp slap is great food served hot quickly and they check on you just enough i was reading and she just came by to clear the plates and leave more coffee and cream either place is great give it a try
4741,this is a great park we came for phillies vs yankees baseball and we even saw miles teller here enjoying the game typically high ballpark prices but the people who work here are always super friendly lots of food options and the diamond club has limitless meal choices especially those that want fancier eats parking is easier here than some places like camden yards definitely worth coming to a game if you re from out of town or delaware like me
4742,just had my first panera delivery experience and it was great the delivery was on time and the nicest delivery guy i ve ever met delivered my lunch he was friendly and polite and seemed like he was having his best day ever max delivered great food with a contagious smile good stuff panera
4743,really really good i had the vegetarian spring rolls and chicken pho the broth was incredible awesome fast and friendly service highly recommend
4744,go on your birthday they have a huge margarita when you show your birthday id for the price of a regular margarita you can see people s reactions when they walk by it s awesome lol the waitress was extremely friendly and helpful we definitely felt welcomed their beef rolls forgot the name are amazing
4745,this place is absolutely unbelievable we got a painkiller and a king thistle and they were both amazing we also got the gummies which were also delicious super friendly bartender super cute decor do yourself a favor and pay this place a visit
4746,i booked a party of 14 for the rusty pelican for april 23 i was coordinating a number of out of town guests who kept revising their rsvp i called to change my reservation number and then showed up with a different number of people the staff accommodated all of that with grace and charm we had a lovely meal with great service thanks rusty pelican
4747,surprise to see so many 5 stars i went in with high expectations and was sadly disappointed i gave this place two visits just in case the first time was just an off day allow me to explain heading out for work i had a craving for donuts i typically do not eat sweets so early but chocolate glazed sounded good read good reviews and had to see for myself well place is nothing spectacular i was expecting full racks shelves and trays stacked with goodies and glass display cabinets filled with cakes of all sorts what i saw instead were half empty racks table of cookies had few selections and atmosphere did not have the great aroma of a fresh bakery and to top it off my cashier very young lady was not that friendly did not even make eye contact as she accepted my payment like i said maybe just an off day so i return another day and this time it was in the afternoon did not see another customer so i figured quick service well three employees were there talking fairly loud one acknowledged my presence and gave me a greeting she had to get through two other employees deep in their loud conversation the lady taking my order had to asked me twice what i said she would apologize for not hearing me the first time as she also apologized for the loud noise coming from the other two i got my order and went on my way the donuts are ok i could buy from grocery store and be just as satisfied i would visit again just to try other items i do support local family businesses so give this place a try
4748,not my usual go to for brunch so when friends suggested we dine there today i welcomed the change up this is first and foremost a whiskey bar so the brunch menu is somewhat limited but the selections were varied and the specials leaned on the foodie side of the equation i was pleasantly surprised had the lobster omelette with a side salad and diced potatoes skillet cooked home fry style it was sublime lobster was wrapped inside the omelette so the flaky chunks of lobster tail were preserved appealing to see and delicious to bite into also attractively priced 14 lloyd s is a strong alternative sunday brunch recommend if you are tired of green eggs honey s cafe lyft etc
4749,highly recommended inexpensive fast and yet so fresh and tasty i ordered noodle soup with pork and clear broth and it was flavorful i find too many restaurants in nashville area that they put too much salt in meals but this place was not like that at all also i m allergic to lemongrass and they made sure that my meal not to be contaminated with it i did not develop any allergic reaction i will definitely come back for another noodle soup the parking area is oddly placed additional parking is under the house but it is not a huge issue this is a casual restaurant good for family friends and couples the interior is designed like a diner so maybe not suitable for romantic dates
4750,amazing pizza and amazing availability times the cheese is stellar and so is the crust best 2am pizza ever great pizza irebfreat bbbb
4751,perfectly fine brunch here with friends nothing to write home about nice setting small portions high price point squash fritters and pasta with goat meat ragu were good everything else was meh my friend loves this place so there is a good chance that she will drag me back lol
4752,my last full day in new orleans and i had to come here came in the pouring rain too i really wanted some authentic new orleans style food yes it s still authentic if it s vegan i don t care what you say lol jamone was nice enough to give me a little taste of everything so i could pick that just made it harder because i wanted it all i m telling you there is no bad choice here everything was so good and flavorful and the bread pudding was the topper for me i would be a regular if i lived out here do yourself a favor and come try this place come hungry too so you can have it all like me oh and the other great thing this is one vegan place where they give you a ton of food without emptying your wallet amazing food and service
4753,such a cute little coffee shop great vibes owners are very nice efficient and great people they have boars head for meat and cheese which is amazing the seating is minimum but you can push tables together they even have an atm but they take card as well bagels sandwiches are yummy lots of coffee options plus snowballs
4754,super friendly people and workers here the food is great but they only two cooks and they work their hardest i come here every time i m in the mood for something fast and delicious they have a wide selection of stir fry and drinks with great pho don t listen to the bad reviews they obviously think it s a rich people place it s a great people,super friendly people and workers here the food is great but they only two cooks and they work their hardest i come here every time i m in the mood for something fast and delicious they have a wide selection of stir fry and drinks with great pho don t listen to the bad reviews they obviously think it s a rich people place it s a great place
4755,fresh home made delicious meals friendly casual environment staff is courteous and eager to make your experience the best by accommodating people s needs i come here every opportunity we have on our road trips the meal away from home
4756,eaten here several times i like this place because the staff is friendly and inside the restaurant is not exposed to the terminal that makes it a little more relaxing basic midwest bar food but good tables are roomy,wanted a carribbean lunch the food was great and for a bit i was not in indiana will come again and will try dinner next time
4757,the food is relatively good but lacks flavor without dressing the burgers for what you get i believe it to be a bit overpriced when ordering i asked for a cup of pickles on the side from the kitchen i received a condiment cup with two pickle slices i laughed at it when my order was delivered and asked the server if i could have some more she returned with a cup of two more pickle slices i don t mean to be picky but when your customer base is paying 13 for a burger and fries you can spare a few more accoutrements i ve found fast food to be more generous
4758,we love pegs and have been to just about every location in town we were so thrilled when peg s moved out to our valley we ve been to this location several times and the only time it wasn t great was the time we sat at the counter that was a mistake but that s not peg s fault we just won t do counter again too much chaos we ve been served a few times by a young man in the back of the room i wish i could remember his name next time i ll write it down but he was the best very hard working gets the orders right always checking in to see if we re okay even when it s busy which it always is lol this young man deserves a raise truly thanks for being consistently the best place in town for breakfast we love pegs
4759,we had a party of 23 for a rehearsal dinner on saturday and couldn t be happier with our choice they make planning simple with very resaonable prices and plenty of choices for private event menus and everything was delicious everyone especially raved about the seared salmon no one had a single complaint about anything how often do you get 23 people together with nothing to whine about
4760,rita johnson exit booth agent extraordinaire national always fast in and fast easy out the icing on the cake rita being efficient and professional then closing with passing you back your license and credit card with a chilled bottle of water and a philadelphia pretzel
4761,i ve been wanting to hit this place for quite some time today seemed perfect for lunch i had the classic cheese steak with crab fries the cheese steak was quite good tender tasty slices of steak and a warm cheesy sauce on a delicious roll the crab fries came out hot and crispy and perfectly seasoned the service was prompt and attentive which i liked very clean and a very nice sports atmosphere i will be back
4762,you can t get this quality of bbq anywhere in the area hickory kitchen is a quaint little byob bbq restaurant right in the center of doylestown i highly recommend it
4763,awesome experience here the employee was there to greet us right away he offered little tasting cups to us if there were any yogurt flavors we would like to try we made our own personal frozen yogurt desserts with flavors and toppings that make it completely your own they have so many toppings candies fruits and sauces it was so much fun choosing what you like and how much of it you wanted to add the the yogurt at the end of the line they weigh your yogurt cup so pricing always varies but it seems fair it was impressively clean everywhere around the toppings yogurt dispensers tables chairs counters and floors my favorite yogurt flavor is cake batter i love adding the cheesecake bites peanuts and carmel sauce to it my daughter likes adding strawberries gummy worms and m ms to any flavor and it seems my son can find as much chocolate as his heart desires definitely fun for the whole family and delicious
4764,this place is awesome their pizza is phenomenal their wings are baked in the pizza oven with onions the taste is exceptional i don t even normally like wings but theirs are so good i get them every time the meatballs are great also
4765,very beautiful and clean store i wanted to check it out today i ve only ever been in one kimberton whole foods and that was in kimberton the store has a variety of everything your heart could desire as far as fresh produce meats fresh baked goods gift items a cafe unfortunately i had just eaten a great breakfast so i couldn t indulge in the samples that were being given i have heard that this is their largest store the staff is top notch and helpful to be honest i think this is a wonderful addition to the community however it is not a place i will be shopping at due to how expensive most items are i tend to get organic products from costco for some items aldi carries a number of organic products as well at considerably lower prices plus i m not sold on the whole organic thing it s worth it if you are on the organic bandwagon it s a fun store to browse happy shopping
4766,i have been coming here since i moved in 2014 they have the best food in town the best beer and the up most best customer service i have never came and left disappointed i used to work at the brewery right next door and i always left mine to come to the depot if you are new in town or visiting this a must stop by they have some awesome tshirts and hats too
4767,i ordered a big order to go from them and it was my first time as well they called me to make sure they got it right and were super nice and helpful the food was your typical kurdish middle eastern plate but extremely delicious you can tell it was fresh and well made my boys and i loved it so much we will definitely order from there again
4768,portions are huge and the apps were delicious service was good too our waiter made us laugh and was popular with my grandmom lol i definitely recommend it for a nice family dinner out for a graduation birthday celebration
4769,i had a taste for something fresh with a ton of flavor i came to pho voorhees for my favorite dish 525 with the grilled shrimp on the side delicious and quick as always
4770,i was walking down iv wasted and i got in trouble with the police and received a pretty insane ticket so my parents got in contact with this firm and got me started on correcting my mistakes the firm handled practically everything even the court appearances i was extremely worried that i would have to have this on my record forever but they were able to get me diversion and its been a breeze since,i ve been going to school in sb for quite some time now and i haven t been the largest fan of seafood but my roommate forced me to come with her and i can t deny the fact that the food here is amazing i don t even remember what we got but we had a very large variety and practically everything was scrumptious
4771,nice spot not too crowded at lunch time got the chicken tinga tacos with red spicy sauce pretty solid tacos would like to see an expanded menu with grilled chicken and steak as choices of protein
4772,enjoyed the atmosphere the cannabis infused drink was a bit toooooo strong other than that it was a great visit but not a place i would go monthly a bit overpriced and over hyped they didnt even have any desserts we wanted to try that was very disappointing
4773,friendly cozy atmosphere loved watching the chef owner doing his craft from the glass panel to the kitchen we tried a bit of everything and were not disappointed a must
4774,erika is a seasoned massage therapist her technique is very thorough relaxing i enjoyed every minute and will be going back for another soon
4775,good food decent indian flavor service can be better a lot of times short of staff
4776,this place has been my go to for thai food for years now i ve tried other places but it s just never as good i order the same thing every time so i can t speak for the rest of the menu but the red curry chicken does not disappoint
4777,we waited for 1 1 2 hours to be seated which is fine considering they told us that when we put our names down but after being seated we waited 45 min for our food to come which is ridiculous the food was very good the biscuit was soft and yummy but no meal is good when you have to wait as along as we did
4778,overpriced for what you get the appetizers were good might go back for apps and drinks not for dinner
4779,price is intimidating but worth it owner is an awesome human bartender was fantastic
4780,we had an issue with an item missing with our takeout cam saved the day by going above and beyond by delivering the missing item to us and even gave a desert for the inconvenience the food was delicious and we d definitely order from them again
4781,yay for drive thru yay for patio yay for change tables in both men s and women s washrooms yay for lots of natural light and seating boo for waiting a looooooong time for my drink yay for friendly barista boo for pretty small merch options in a location this big yay for coffee,popped in to get gas in the work vehicle today and that was the most confusing fleet card experience i have ever had in my life i m still confused as to why it was so confusing anyhoo this location has a car wash fuel as well as a fairly big snack drink section for a hughes i m sure i ll be seeing you again hughes
4782,lisa and miles make the perfect dynamic duo they are both very friendly and professional with the way they conduct business they are always informed on the latest market trends and offer great advice especially to first time buyers like myself i would definitely recommend them for all of your real estate needs
4783,this little tasting room on stearns wharf is a relaxing treat the staff is extremely warm and conversational tasting flights are priced fairly and the atmosphere is a joy to just chill in while drinking great wine
4784,tonight was my first night at circle 7 the service was great food came out quicker than expected for a friday night my only complaint was that my steak was well done not medium
4785,bimmerworks has been great so far just stopped in for my first visit steve is a wealth of knowledge work was done quickly and well ill definitely be back
4786,the service was excellent the barista was attentive friendly and the latte was unique as well as delicious it s also a charming location with a lovely front patio i am looking into moving into this neighbourhood and elm cafe may have clinched it
4787,the food was awesome and so was the service i would suggest the banana foster french toast
4788,good comfort food tried several dishes and all were good except the wonton in chili sauce it just lack the flavor service was good will come back again to try other dishes
4789,first time at this location but 2nd time eating at bluewater we had the shrimp skewers and halibut special both were good i had their birthday sunday which was very good never had mcconnell s ice cream but it was rich and delicious if you get the right seat there is a nice new of the ocean
4790,a few years ago there used to be a bar louie in clay terrace i loved it especially the 5 burgers and drink specials came here this past saturday night the band was quite good and started around 9 30pm the food was good bar pub food with tots the drinks were ok i liked my moscow mule but the browned lime was disappointing for a 9 50 drink parking is mostly street parking or you can park in the church parking lot across the street cars go quickly at night down that corner be careful service was meh it took a while for someone to get to us at bar there was one bartender who was pretty on it if i was able to get his attention we were good you kinda had to flag down otherwise or be ok with waiting 15 min for a drink i will probably be back but wouldn t go out of my way i want to see how brunch is
4791,dayum that was a good burger juicy glistening melting with cheese simplistic yet tastes completely different from other burger joints due the quality of the ingredients bacon looks good in pictures but it was a too thick of slice of puuuure white fat if it would have melted in my mouth it would have worked but it didn t therefore just felt sinful in a bad way unfortunately this communal table trend has got to go i hate it it s a crap shoot on who your going to get to sit next to and basically listen to a complete strangers stupid conversations terrible idea
4792,really terrific experience we brought a group of middle school students and split them up into the four different rooms that are offered without exception all the students and the adult chaperones had a fantastic time the puzzles were ingenious and the person in the room with us was helpful but not too helpful we definitely had to do a lot of problem solving highly recommended
4793,i love this place i sell and buy all the time the staff are incredible i went in yesterday and they had reorganized all of the clothing and it looks much better some items such as swings and bassinet are a bit overpriced but overall i love this place
4794,delicious and very nicely presented we had j sushi and fire roll and fantastic excellent service and great value
4795,beautiful hotel and facilities large king bedroom is quite spacious very clean nice linens nice bathroom friendly staff amazing light and music show close to several restaurants and venues my only wish would ve been a bathtub don t miss this gorgeous historic hotel
4796,outstanding service our shower door was installed incorrectly the glass doctor nick came out reinstalled the door correctly in a very timely manner and charged a very reasonable fee for the service we will call the glass doctor again for any of our glass repair needs definitely a 5 star business
4797,kimpton hotels are among my favorite hotels they are trendy and modern the decor is beautiful i love that they are pet friendly and don t charge extra fees they have peanut butter flavored treats for your pet at check in they can also provide you with a loaner pet bed water bowl mat and even food if you forget the rooms are clean and airy each room comes with a free yoga mat and umbrella you can also borrow a bike to ride around the city the staff are friendly and make sure you feel welcomed a complimentary happy hour is hosted everyday from 5 6pm and free coffee and tea in the morning located in old city across from independence hall there are a lot of homeless in that area so definitely use caution when we were walking a homeless man came charging towards us which was scary he was definitely high and when we told him to stop and leave us alone he cursed at us and called us dirty b s luckily we were ok and we were able to continue walking
4798,lauren did an amazing job i came in a few months ago with dark red brown hair two sessions later i have bright beautiful blonde hair every time she does a bomb ass job especially considering how much work this type of project takes and the amount of skill to execute it seriously go to her for all your hair transformation needs because duh
4799,they finally brought back the buffalo chicken this is one of the best business decisions they ve made my vote gets changed to a five star now
4800,we went here on the recommendation of some friends it is not in the best neighborhood but that seems to be the state of most of greater downtown reno as the name implies it was once a train station the central area is a brew pub the dining area is a separate room away from the pub it is a bit quieter in the dining room but noise from the pub is noticeable the food is very good my wife commented on how good her burger was it was hot a bit greasy and very flavorful i liked my fish and chips but will probably get a burger if i return if you are young and enjoy craft beer this just might be the place for you in reno me i am a few decades too old for this scene,january 2017 this is one of those metal and wood modern restaurants we ate breakfast here on a freezing morning between snow storms so forgiving me for saying that this place feels cold on the other hand the wait staff is among the best i have experienced the others in our party ordered typical egg potatoes meat and toast breakfasts i ordered the apricot granola pancakes what i expected was granola and pieces of apricot baked into the pancakes what i received was four beautiful fluffy pancakes covered with baked apricot granola the pancakes were delicious on their own a little syrup made the pancakes better adding the granola pushed them over the top my only regret was that i could only eat three of the four pancakes our wait person told me that they do not offer a short stack version i stole a piece of bacon from my wife it was good but a little undercooked for my taste i like my bacon crisp march 2018 it was cold and windy outside so we retreated to the roundabout grill for dinner i ordered tomato bisque soup and house made rigatoni the soup was so good that i was tempted to cancel the rigatoni and get a couple more cups of soup i am glad i do not do that because the rigatoni was about the best i have ever enjoyed the flavor balance was excellent with just the right amount of sausage the next morning i ordered the apricot granola hot cakes that i had eaten in january 2017 they seemed a bit drier than the last time slightly over cooked it took a bit more syrup to get them just right but they were as good as i remembered them
4801,okay so with my traumatizing hair dilemma from last time i was a bit nervous to try this place again i will say they promptly sent me a message saying they would refund me and credit me for another meal so that was nice this next order was really delicious and no issues with anything weird in it the girl even called because of a gluten free issue from the uber eats selections and credited me back for something i was overcharged for so as of now i am a satisfied customer
4802,dr staten is very good as is his staff location by old town mall they are all very knowledgeable of what they have what they can do and what they cannot do my husband has very bad eyes he requires special glasses high index that are quite thick jackie the office manager let us know that they would be quite expensive there but we could save money online or elsewhere which i appreciated her honesty and we were able to find glasses at walmart for a fraction of the cost my children also had a great time here getting their eyes checked for the first time dr staten was very nice to them and really made sure their eyes were thoroughly checked the gal don t remember her name dark hair and glasses been there forever is really helpful at finding glasses with you she has a good opinion of what looks good or not i appreciate her she s helped me over fifteen years find the right glasses for me i just want to thank the staff for their kindness friendliness knowledge and help i appreciate all of you as does my family i highly recommend them double check your insurance first make sure they are in your network
4803,had a great experience here in this lovely and clean salon today someone recommended it to me and i m so glad they did i had a great pedicure with a massage and the person who did it was excellent and also a great resource for restaurants in nola the owners couldn t have been nicer and i enjoyed talking with them about us both having a french bulldog as a pet i would highly recommend this place
4804,the pharmacy gals are all excellent the store is always clean and the product in stock sweet
4805,we came here for our last dinner in nola and i m so glad we did yes the biscuits are delicious the small bites and entrees were even better we ordered the pork tenderloin goat curry chicken snapper oysters and dirty rice balls all soooo good everything was so flavorful and fresh hoping that i have the opportunity to go back someday
4806,i went there this morning for breakfast first of all as first impression the place looks cool you can sit inside or outside the counter is stylish and it felt comfortable to sit there the girls are good looking and professional i got a cappuccino a chocolate croissant and and almond croissant for my wife i must say that all three items were awesome the coffee was great my croissant was good and i was about to get another one and my wife loved the almond croissant my wife is french and she said that this is the closest she ever got to a french croissant yet in the usa,very nice place fast service very pleasant really good food we got the vanilla yogurt with fruit and the croissant breakfast and they are both really yummy
4807,a restaurant worth visiting this place offers exceptional service and a delicious menu the staff are class acts and the venue is beautiful well done and thank you for making my dining experience such a great one
4808,omg go and try everything the biscuits will make you slap your momma thank me later
4809,it was great i had crab benedict just the kind of place i was looking for paud parking on the street was easy to find
4810,this is my favorite mexican restaurant they have authentic mexican food with great quality and awesome price my favorite entree is the steak burrito
4811,road warrior here on the road for 3 weeks at a time in a city so doing laundry while traveling is normal for me stayed at the grove they don t have a coin operated laundry for guests so i come to jiffy clean when i m in town spotlessly clean believe me i ve seen some grungy laundromats in this country the machines are wiped down often clean inside and out the floors and folding counters are clean and the attendant is constantly working the room the soap dispenser and change machine is in the far room around the corner i love the credit card reader on all of the machines good assortment of top and front loaders and cheap 25 cent dryers top loader will take only 29 minutes for a cycle on the warm water setting and the korean restaurant next door is great for a meal while doing laundry
4812,i really miss the tofu and spicy eggplant i always get half chow mein and half steamed vegetables mostly very good but under no circumstances should you even put one of those awful carrots into your mouth i can t imagine what they have done to the carrots but they taste like poison and maybe cut the broccoli just a little bit more
4813,the friendliest and most welcoming staff i ve ever encountered despite waiting an hour for our reservation we enjoyed a delicious authentic moroccan dinner complimentary wine and belly dancing entertainment also loved the decor and arabic music is a plus i cannot wait to come back
4814,although this place was a bit pricey for me the food was delicious i had recently been to italy and this place was very close to the real thing i had the mozzarella caprese and gnocci al telefono both with were very good the atmosphere was nice on the patio last spring and i enjoyed the experience,this is the best hardware store ever it is locally owned and whenever i need how to advice on what i need or how to fix something i know i can walk in and get the help i need the staff is very friendly and helpful couldn t recommend it more
4815,time for my favorite cheese steak extra mushroom with america cheese omg is the bomb they are very fast friendly folks always extra staff on weekends they get pretty busy always very fresh freshly made food
4816,i had the bourbon street breakfast i didn t realize it came with real bourbon which you re supposed to pour on top of the banana pecan pancakes it was worth the wait keep in mind you have to be patient if they re really busy decor is traditional french quarter and it feels very cozy when you re here
4817,the family wanted pizza for dinner we prefer grandma s in the kitchen pizza i ve been looking for decent pizza in delaware for over 8 years i finally found some the ravioli with shrimp and marinara sauce was surprisingly good also the house cabernet was horrible hey two out of three ain t bad
4818,went for dessert and had the banana cyrano made table side with a great presentation the taste did not disappoint ice cream was incredibly smooth 5 of us shared two flamb orders plenty to go around
4819,we simply had drinks on the balcony but they were superb as was the view would have loved to have lunch on the balcony but it wasn t allowed
4820,the store is clean the staff made me feel comfortable leaving my pet with them i would definitely bring all my dogs here and the price is perfect
4821,the reviews are true all of them depending on what irks you you ll love this place or leave pissed off and possibly disgusted i love baseball and have been coming here since i was a kid so i m probably a bit bias
4822,we booked rooms for 3 couples through expedia and we were all very pleased with our one week stay at the wyndham the staff was courteous and helpful rooms were spacious clean and comfortable in order to take the elevators to guest floors you needed to have a room key this was an unexpected plus the location was convenient when booking our trip we wanted to be close to bourbon street but fortunately we ended up on royal street which turned out to be much nicer cleaner and had wonderful shopping and restaurants
4823,i m so happy for the naked peach to open the owners been doing makeup for over 15 years 1st class
4824,don t judge a book by its cover street tacos served on the corner outside of a truck always fresh awesome customer service and the fish and shrimp tacos can be separate are amazing i spent some time in mexico and have had street tacos while visiting in mexico this place is by far the most authentic i ve had in tampa
4825,had the trainwreck omelette breakfast and my husband had the brioche french toast with pralines breakfast 2 weekends in a row the waitress didn t let us down awesome meals and service love this place
4826,living in the chicago area my whole life i didn t realize how spoiled i was with all the amazing italian food until i moved here it s almost impossible to find decent italian food in this area but mirko pasta finally filled the void the eggplant parmesan was delicious it was a large portion and i had to force myself not finish it because it was so good the restaurant has a nice upscale casual feel i will definitely be back
4827,great workout great employees was here for work and dropped into a class they were extremely welcoming and explained the entire class to be prior as it was my first time participating in a barry s class got a great sweat in and made sure to grab a delicious shake on my way out

4829,i ordered mix veggie pizza and it was fantastic veggies were flavorful and the crust was thin and delicious highly recommend
4830,4 75 5 if you like want italian food and don t like wet noodles and dry chicken this is the place our server kathy was great very knowledgeable and attentive but not pushy or bothering they have great selection of beer and wine and the food is great we chicken parmesan and a calzone for our entree and a fried trio of ravioli cheese poppers with sauce appetizer all were great we had enough left to take home for another meal pricing is very good also you can get a gumbo soup breadsticks and entree for about 13 there is a small bar with tvs also only complaint is the seating is on the cheaper smaller side if your a bigger or taller man you will not be to comfy that s all that has this place back from being perfect v
4831,i have lived in st louis my whole life and i haven t figured out why this is such a hot spot they have okay ice cream and when i go with my family i often don t even get ice cream i much prefer to get something like a brownie or slushee over the ice cream
4832,this place is where the former pollo loco used to be next to the launder mat i m always in search of the best breakfast burrito and this place has it delicious homemade flour tortillas made daily along with a fresh salsa bar with 4 different salsas to choose from they offer daily specials too i ll definitely be back for lunch dinner
4833,came about 7 on a saturday night 7 july 2018 after attending a wedding in town we were just walking around looking for a place with decent indoor seating so we could escape all the smokers who seem to infest the streets of reno husband enjoyed the soccer on the tv and the inside was loud but not terrible our server jared l gave us time with the menu and we ordered a mixed green salad with lemon vinaigrette 4 25 to share the lamb burger with no olive salsa and a wheat bun 10 50 and the barley chicken 9 95 we both were big fans of the salad dressing i would have bought a bottle to take with me if possible the barley chicken had a lot of barley too much for my husband s taste but it was good in general my lamb burger was perfect and delicious it was one of the best burgers i ve had the goat cheese really complimented the lamb which isn t a very tasty meat on its own and it was perfectly cooked the burger was so big i couldn t finish it and reheating wasn t an option so i was sad to leave so much behind total bill was 26 75 with only water to drink we would return here if ever back in reno
4834,great food and service i ll be going back soon it s authentic kurdish food for a reasonable price which makes a great establishment their kebobs were flavorful and compliments their side dishes

4839,chili s food isn t my top favorite but they always have good deals we went for lunch and i had the loaded potato soup as a starter and the bacon chicken quesadilla both for 7 and i was very pleased they also always have 2 for 1 drink specials on house wine and house margaritas tip you can get flavored margaritas and the blackberry one is great brian is the best server in the world he was so kind and patient he made sure the orders were right and he split the check even before we asked little things we asked for like lemons and ranch were brought out promptly great service if you go try to get a table where he can serve you you won t regret it
4840,i stopped in here tonight regardless of all of the poor reviews i was staying close to this restaurant and thought what the heck i ll try it out when i arrived the restaurant was fairly empty i proceeded to the bar and sat near a tv and the bartender she quickly showed me the happy hour specials as well as the menu they had some awesome happy hour specials on their cocktails a martini was 5 50 and a glass of wine was only three dollars this is an excellent place to stop by for a happy hour with your friends and family i ended up ordering the ahi tuna and it came out perfectly rare with a light sear on the outside the service was good and the food was excellent i understand that there are a lot of negative reviews on this restaurant but i can tell you firsthand that at least at the bar the service was good and the food was excellent if you are looking for a great happy hour menu and some good atmosphere i highly recommend stopping at this joint sit at the bar and you will have a great experience
4841,food is really good cajun shrimp is my favorite also the avocado and taro smoothies are amazing
4842,on be na private pool b ieo like k ok ll be next non no up on no i am m in by i to m in mm mm n in mok nolu p a m i mkiilnpm ini
4843,cool spot patio vibes af service was slow restaurant empty but the hamburger with the tomato jam tits do it
4844,incredible service and food i ordered the filet shrimp combo with lobster mac cheese and brussel sprouts as sides everything was delicious
4845,great all around it s downtown so i was expecting a harder time to find close parking but it s in a good corner
4846,highly recommend best pizza joint ever my family was traveling back from spring break and we were looking for exactly this we ordered 3 small pizzas due to dietary requirements and the four of us finished it all with full tummies this place had it all great pizza great prices great service who doesn t love supporting a local business it was a little out off the interstate but well worth the extra 2 3 min to get there
4847,gin opened in february 2018 it is a wonderful addition to the expansive asian food scene in new orleans korean bbq is an interactive dining experience each table has a built in gas grill where you cook marinated meats and veggies it is a unique and fun dining experience our party of six dined on sunday night we arrived at 7 00 and the restaurant was busy but not full our waiter was named peter and he was helpful we ordered the combo 4 for four and peter recommended we order an additional meat that turned out to be plenty of food we chose beef bulgogi beef short ribs beef skirt steak chicken bulgogi and spicy squid my favorites were the beef bulgogi and the beef short ribs
4848,we tried two varieties of pizza and both were excellent easily some of the highest quality pizza i ve had in south jersey the owner john was there and was warm and friendly the actual facility is immaculately clean with all the mediocre pizza places on every corner it s great to find a place that uses high quality ingredients you can absolutely taste the difference i highly recommend organico
4849,tomo is my favorite sushi place old city this place ticks all of my boxes great food great service and great ambience it is so rare that you find a place that does all three things so well the food is top notch the sushi is fresh with complex flavor the tomo and margarita rolls are not to be missed the wait staff is attentive and warm which makes tomo a place you want to come back to time after time the design of the space is clean modern and hip without being off putting and the aquatic life murals on the walls are gorgeous tomo is a neighborhood sushi place with prices and food that can t be beat
4850,after being concerned about a recent service i was impressed that plymouth auto was accountable for their work and made good on what might otherwise have been a not great situation
4851,my fianc and i attended the roux class at the cooking school during our stay in nola and we simply don t have enough great things to say chef robin is hilarious and so fun to learn from we ended up making a delicious gumbo crawfish etoufee and chocolate chip bread pudding with a brandy mocha sauce omg they give you a copy of the recipes electronically we can t wait to try out recreating these at home thank you mardi gras school of cooking for a wonderful experience make this the highlight of your trip for sure
4852,i d give it 4 5 stars if possible but it s not host station needs some work on greeting customers i e we re patrons not trespassers arrived three minutes early you re welcome for an 11 am brunch reservation hostess asked us to step aside until called to the largely vacant dining room we weren t alone she dismissed others that arrived as well curtly we politely waited until a few minutes after our reservation to be dispatched to a table at the back of the restaurant our waitress arrived in short order we ordered the punch of the week and a couple entrees the burger was outstanding truly outstanding including the brioche bun getting ketchup and mustard not so much wife enjoyed her meal as well waitress refilled the punch without asking which was a nice touch a little over one hundred bucks for brunch in a cool venue we d go back but the hostess stand could use some retooling they set the tone for the experience and simply failed i hope the 5 star review with some advice helps the bad attitudes improve
4853,i really do enjoy this food you can tell it is made with care and consideration overall delicious
4854,great food drinks and an amazing ambiance really good service definitely recommend for large parties
4855,i ve been a fan for years however the last two visits within the last two months were disappointing the wings were extremely small the portions are equivalent to most kids meals the wings are tasty that s not enough to keep my loyalty unfortunately i will not be placing future orders
4856,pizza was decent good amount of sauce and cheese but cheese was a little chewy cheesesteak pizza with red sauce was good and off menu i think probably not my new go to but i ll likely go back and check out more of the menu
4857,legit bbq joint i just got back from a quick lunch trip and was not disappointed i ordered the brisket sliced a pork belly taco and a side of corn bread the brisket was tender with the right amount of bark the pork belly taco was phenomenal would easily have ordered 3 of them instead of 1 and left extremely happy i tried all four sauces that were available the house sauce was good the mustard was better than expected the vinegar was ok in all fairness i m not a huge vinegar sauce fan but the espresso sauce was the winner all sauces were well above average the service was fantastic as well i will be back there again probably next week
4858,dr k is the best vet we ve ever been to and we ve been to a lot she is the most compassionate person and has always given our cats the very best care she s extremely affordable compared to other vets we ve been to which is a definite plus all the techs we ve seen are equally as awesome all the stars for parker s paws
4859,absolutely fantastic i have an older car so it can be really difficult to smog and they are really friendly and give us tips to help us out come here every year and they re great highly recommend them
4860,i grew up in the area i have been going to this theater all my life it is an older movie theater this theater has comfy seats the prices for tickets and consession are pretty expensive that s why i don t go there much any more
4861,stayed here 3 nights and had a room that overlooked the garden atrium this hotel is like an indoor small city i had fun just walking around the entire property exploring different things i took the opportunity to walk around after midnight for an hour or so and it was very peaceful walking through the garden areas and listening to the waterfalls the room was nice but nothing spectacular loved the small balcony we ate a few times on property the old hickory steakhouse was high above expectations food was really good and the service was exceptional one of the coffee spots closest to the lobby had breakfast sandwiches for 5 39 which turned out to be a sub par product it was first made incorrectly and then when it was re made it was ice cold if 5 39 is going to be the price it better deliver 5 39 worth of value and it did not my interactions with staff around the hotel was very good everyone was friendly and pleasant to talk to and would go out of their way to acknowledge you and make conversation even one of the maintenance people asked how our stay was while riding in the elevator
4862,pretty good food very fast service and they re pretty friendly as well it s definitely a good price range for quality food i got a fruit tea which was delicious my husband and i shared an omelette and some french toast the french toast was really heavy but the omelette was really good cute restaurant to stop at
4863,first time in the door and the owner spoke to me like we were long time friends his daughter was working that night and both were so friendly and welcoming their pizza is great i got the greek salad and a supreme pizza enough food for two days thanks slimms for the welcome to fishers
4864,cute remodel nice decor some of the wait staff was friendly others not so it was hot in there we sat at the sushi bar right by the ac thermostat it read 77 degrees at 7 30 pm on a july night i didn t like that our waiter tried handing us the check when we were still waiting for my husband s last dish he even still had his chopsticks in his hands once the chef shook his head at him he walked away my husband ordered the all raw feed me for 60 which was 5 dishes they were all crafted with a lot of thought tons of flavor and precision in the plating the last dish was new zealand king salmon which came in fresh that day all of the fish was super fresh the portions were very small more like a tasting he was still hungry afterwards i got the dumplings which were very delicious and also the monkey salmon dish it was good as well but the portions again were small all of the fish was sliced thin and small in size i d say go once to experience luvi but if you like to eat sushi sashimi like we do find another place it s too pricy for what you get
4865,i know that a target is a target but this one has proved to be reliable enough for me to want to drive 15 mins to it to get all my necessities in one place even though i could go to a cheaper grocery store everything s pretty organized the times i ve come and the service is really good there s a starbucks inside i ve never had to wait in line super long huge parking lot clean store inside sometimes the employees seem grumpy but hey maybe it s just the day
4866,this place is beautiful most kimpton properties i ve stayed at have been they always have unique interior design and at this hotel the design was noticeable from the carpets to the chairs and colors in the room really well done i guess that s one of my things whenever i stay somewhere it s always the little stuff that you notice that makes you say that s nice and this hotel had a lot of those little things from the exterior entrance the lobby elevators and of course when you walk in the room and of course the bed if you re not disappointed in any way at any of those points you ve got yourself a great hotel it s also larger than other kimpton properties that i ve stayed at in washington d c which was nice it s right in the heart of the city and a great place to stay highly recommend it
4867,can t believe i m just now finding out about this place after living in the area for almost 4 years now i love their who set up and food is amazing a menu like no other with specials that change daily new favorite spot for breakfast or brunch
4868,we are from mn and i saw this place on social media and new i had to try we had lots of different things from the menu and i had coffee and the chicken fried pork belly biscuit and it was loaded with flavor and was absolute delicious the service was excellent and very nice and i would be a regular if i lived nearby thumbs up from me
4869,the menu is extremely limited and overpriced some of the seating is weird i would not highly recommend this restaurant
4870,i was visiting from out of town and looking for a place to get a hiit workout in and found getfit615 i could not be happier that i did kate was so welcoming and encouraging throughout the class which itself was great and the gym had a community feel to it even though i didn t live in the area i got a follow up postcard the next week thanking me for visiting i was so impressed by getfit615 and wish i lived in nashville so i could go more often
4871,the lines were really long for tickets so i almost missed my movie however the attendant was really nice and helpful the seats in the theatre are comfy with plenty of leg room they have many movies to select from since it s such a big theatre wouldgoagain
4872,we had a great birthday party here for my son the team was so helpful and kind they made the process simple and were patient with all of our silly ideas and requests we ll definitely be back here for a day of fun and will be our go to place for the summer totally worth the commute across town
4873,so many good things about mazzaro s starting with the murals on the walls can t see from 22nd once inside the selection of cheeses coffee meats and most importantly wines is amazing do yourself a favor and stop in i guarantee you will love it
4874,we visit this spot every time we go to new orleans during our last trip our 9 year old animal activist came along even though we knew finding something on the menu would be tough for her we were seated underneath a large animal head and she became dramatic and said she wouldn t eat here with that animal staring at her i was just about to beat her ass when our server ritchie rich came to the rescue and covered the animal head with a towel she was pleased and no beating transpired the whole restaurant cheered ritchie also brought her a plate of fruit that was off menu the food is incredible and consistent every time we visit thanks ritchie for saving me from jail time
4875,it s clean it s comfortable you get cookies for free and every staff member i encountered was very welcoming and nice the pool is kind of small though but that s not a huge deal the parking garage is an old city garage so it s not exactly nice but again i m from a large city so i m used to what it is it s a garage what do you expect overall i enjoyed the place a lot very pleasant
4876,i have been getting waxed here for years and have been satisfied with the services the staff is cordial and professional today however was something different tyisha is a gifted aesthetician she is thorough and careful the wax was the perfect temperature and the removal painless this woman is a revelation i had a new spring in my step walking out today i ll never go to anyone else thank you tyisha
4877,best indian food i ve ever had in the united states their tikka masala is the best pro tip be sure to order it with mushrooms they also have great poori bread indian elephant ears and mango lassis whenever i m visiting indy i make an effort to visit their chicken biryani is also very good
4878,true life i came here for the 5 burger night that happens every tuesday pick a burger of your choice and get a side of fries or tots for 5 even and these are burgers that are normally priced 11 12 so it s definitely a great deal bar louie fills a void in carmel for a hip bar restaurant open late every time i drive by they are packed and by 6 p m on a tuesday it was pretty full this is a popular spot for people to hang out and it s got a cool atmosphere with two stories i got the philly burger mushrooms provolone and onions with fries and everything was good but my medium well burger was a little overdone and tasted charred for taste i prefer bru burger down the street but this is a good deal on a tuesday night pro tip park in the free parking lot behind the building,indianapolis is consistently ranked one of the best convention centers in the country and the world class indiana convention center icc is one of the many reasons why for one it s huge and thus easy to get lost in at times for example indy hosts 60 000 people for gencon each summer here i ve never been inside the icc during a convention but i imagine when there is an event in town there is clear signage on where to go as there can be many conferences happening at once under the same roof for hosting so many thousands of people the icc has yet to show signs of wear and tear that i can see it s always clean perhaps the biggest perk is the icc is within walking distance of countless hotels and restaurants some are even connected by skywalk lucas oil stadium and bankers life fieldhouse are a stone s throw away and you re near attractions like the indianapolis zoo and other museums we are lucky to have such a fabulous venue in indy,not bad for a first visit i ordered the farmhouse breakfast which includes eggs your way two slices of bacon potatoes and choice of toast for a saturday brunch we were in and out in an hour but when we left it was getting busy so don t be surprised if there is a wait bub s burgers down the street starts every meal with a free chili shooter and bub s cafe version is a small container of granola yum i wouldn t go out of my way to eat here but it is a convenient breakfast in the carmel arts design district
4879,i really love nosh i originally came to try their happy hour on a friday but arrived at almost 8pm luckily they have their bubbles bar from 4 close on friday s where select rose and sparkling wines are just 4 bucks fast forward to the following friday and i m in again but this time to actually try happy hour my bartender from last week remembers my name and order i was able to have my usual ros since i m a frequent diner now i was also able to try the bites from their happy hour menu first of all the mac and cheese was bomb af it was cheesy and seasoned something i was not expecting so kudos the pasta which was either orecchiette or tortellini was al dente not my fave but i ll order that mac and cheese again any day i also enjoyed the sliders which were good spring rolls and poutine fries all of the food thus far was really good came out quickly service was great from hostess to bartender to server to managers checking in nosh is really a cute spot to unwind at i m really happy to have found my now go to happy hour spot
4880,best place for breakfast everything is made from scratch and the sos is to die for even though we moved to philly we still make the trip almost every saturday for breakfast
4881,a nashville must bring your appetite pancakes are massive but delicious depending on time you arrive be prepared to wait but your wait will totally be worth it
4882,my husband and i just got married at the riviera mansion on july 12 2018 the venue and staff were absolutely perfect we had 65 guests at our wedding and the space felt cozy enough but had plenty of room to accommodate a greater guest count as well we had our ceremony and cocktail hour outside which was beautiful and then a sit down plated dinner inside the staff exceeded our expectations with their attentiveness and attention to detail the food was phenomenal all of our guests were extremely impressed with the appetizers salad and main course selections we were able to do a tasting a the venue prior to creating our menu which was also very nice and helpful breanna the coordinator for the venue was a pleasure to work with replied to all of my emails immediately the venue was super accommodating to our needs the staff were friendly and provided amazing service throughout the entire event and the wedding venue is gorgeous we especially loved the bridal suite and grooms room which allowed us to get ready on site with our wedding parties and family the riviera mansion is a dream wedding venue and i would highly recommend this site
4883,delicious super affordable nice people excellent staff sometimes the owners cook comes out and says hi the food is low priced there are great deals for under 5 for a complete breakfast which is unheard of but is definitely delicious i highly recommend their sausage it s unique and very flavory the coffee is delicious service is fast the place is clean the bathroom is clean i take a lot of business friends to this and i ve taken my wife to this i ve never been disappointed great breakfast deals and excellent food for lunch highly highly recommended
4884,absolutely incredible the ambiance the service the menu selections the wine list everything was 5 stars my wife and i shared the smoked salmon crostini followed by the water melon salad and the halibut dish as an entree everything was cooked to perfection and absolutely incredible we finished the meal with the lemon coconut panna cotta each dish tasted incredible and was perfectly balanced in flavor and texture if you visit or live in franklin and have not experienced the red pony you are missing out the are the standard in service and excellent food quality
4885,we came here for a team dinner during our company convention and the service was outstanding all of the appetizers were on point especially the charbroiled oysters i had the creole house po boy that was super legit great beer options and great ambiance i will be back to visit on my next trip to new orleans
4886,i love the kuchi for two deal only 49 ask for chef andy he s funny and makes the best hibachi
4887,loved the vibe and music and the service was great i ordered the salmon and it was excellent however my boyfriend ordered the noble pig pizza and it was very soggy besides that it was a great experience and we d come back
4888,visited panera for dinner tonight and had amazing customer service courtesy of bill he greeted us as soon as we walked in with a smile but what made it even better was his incredible personality i will visit panera just in hopes of being able to talk to bill great job
4889,creole house you are on my list of must return when in nola appetizers crawfish cakes delicious whatever that sauce was it was asking to be licked off of the plate bacon garlic oysters my gawd these things are addicting i had to stop myself from ordering more they were freshly chargrilled like you couldn t just pick them up off the plate they were literally piping hot and ridiculously amazing entrees taste of the bayou crawfish etouffee red beans rice jambalaya all were very good but the star of this plate was the etouffee the flavors blended so well and the seasoning was spot on no hot sauce needed the jambalaya needed a few drops but it was good as well red beans better than anything in california shrimp and grits i never finish plates at restaurants i am the to go box queen but this plate i scraped it clean the gouda grits were decedent rich flavorful the shrimp were fresh and plentiful the cherry tomatoes were the perfect garnish i was completely blown away by the complexity of the flavors oh and by the way the service was great they were busy but the server was very friendly and kept up with us places like this are the reason i could not live in nola i d be obese and broke see you next time creole house
4890,food was pretty good we had a long day and it was good to have delicious indo chinese food
4891,this place is a hidden gem the food here is a bit trendy but very well prepared the drink menu has original drinks from their bar i found the atmosphere very relaxing i would highly recommend you check this place out it s not cheap but i found my meal worth the money and i am looking forward to returning for another meal
4892,this place is amazing great food and service i would definitely go again when i m in town
4893,omg totally amazing call early to get on the schedule and sit back for amazing cake we have gotten two cakes so far and they also do gluten free i sent them the link to my wife s cake pinterest page and they got back to me with some ideas they had from there and well it was amazing my wife had made a request for a cake for our daughter s graduation and seriously this looked like something from food networks and tasted even better
4894,i have never been to a texas roadhouse before i am visiting from chicago and i was so pleased with the food steak and shrimp the best thing about my visit there was our server his name was alberto and he was one of the best waiters i have ever had great service and the food was amazing fun atmosphere
4895,great selection and atmosphere we had to stay a bit longer to ride out the rain but that was totally cool with us 2 more pours please
4896,haven t been in awhile decided to stop in for lunch just a few patrons in the bar the beer selection is extensive many local beers which i like selected to irish sandwich which is basically rueben with a twist and the house made chips sandwich great chips were stale i asked bartender if they were made order she said yes yet they were cold and soggy clearly leftovers never was checked on after i started on the sandwich bartender never engaged with guests just flat and took orders didn t offer the specials after about four visits of basically the same lackluster service i think i m moving on too bad because i like the beer selection and supporting local businesses
4897,i really like their ribs staff and environment i ve been coming here for over 10 years and it s still a good time on every visit live band tonight stop by
4898,this bakery never fails me while the shop itself is small and has little seating it is a must visit every time i go on south street the first time i walked in it was just a convenient place to grab a snack while pudding is not the traditional fare that comes to mind when i think of a bakery their pudding has to be tried they have banana with spin offs with salted caramel peanut butter and strawberry among others plus some non banana flavors they contain vanilla wafers and chunks of fruit and it is absolutely the best pudding i ve ever eaten in my life such a perfect custard consistency and absolutely delicious their cupcakes also shouldn t be missed i m not the biggest cupcake fan but theirs are amazing the icing isn t too sweet and the cake isn t too dry i especially love some of their unique flavors like sweet potato but even their standard flavors like vanilla bean are something special
4899,this place was amazing from start to finish first it was easy to make a reservation online then we arrive and the restaurant is gorgeous everything made you as the diner feel transported to a different area including the music playing softly in the background then we are seated and our waiter was wonderful he was continuously attentive and had great suggestions on what to order we decided to split 5 mezza between the two of us we tried the hummous taboule fatteh fried kibbeh and the batata harra everything was great but the fatteh was beyond wonderful it was so good that we almost got one for dessert but we were filled by the end of the meal i will definitely be returning soon thanks for a wonderful meal
4900,i cannot say enough great things about jdog glenside outstanding service extremely responsive helpful organized on time friendly and so nice to work with everything happened just as stacey outlined they made things easy during a tough time cleaning out our parents house my father served in the navy so it was important to hire an organization that supports our veterans all around a win win highly recommend
4901,when we got there everyone was friendly and courteous the check in was quick and simple the check out was even easier with no surprises we were going to just carry our bag up ourselves since we didn t have many since the bellman wasn t available that second one of the other guys offered to do it every parking attendant we were helped by was friendly and efficient parking for one night was 41 that is outrageous but i don t hold it against the hotel because that s the going rate in that area just pissy about it
4902,i was here a few weeks ago and this experience really stood out for my trip kerry was a gem he even helped me locate the coffee shop to purchase their coffee which i fell in love with i would definitely recommend
4903,went on the refugio state beach kayaking tour guides were kind prepared knowledgable and interesting a nice adventure
4904,came here from out of town for a graduation dinner and the staff was very accommodating to hold a cake in the back for us to surprise the graduate which was very nice there was a group of 10 15 of us and the restaurant was spaced out well to where we did not feel crowded we started off with the chicken 65 veg pakora and shrimp manchurian all came out with good timing hot and fresh the chicken was quite juicy and had the right amount of heat the shrimp were plump and buttery and the veg pakora were crispy and did not have that super oily taste that they sometimes can have we ordered the lamb tikka masala and the tandoori chicken for our entree and i will have to say the lamb melted in our mouth there was no gamey taste yet it definitely still had a nice lamb flavor to it which was accompanied well by the gravy the tandoori chicken was good but i would not say anything special it was lacking in the umami department although it was a nice pieces of meat we ordered everything medium and it had the perfect amount of heat i would say we like heat but not anything that is going to make us sweat i probably wouldn t visit here again since i am coming in from out of town but if i lived near by i am sure it would be one of my indian food take out spots
4905,great service by the lady who came see had we been waited on my burger wasnt cooked adequately however it s good place to visit i stop once we arrived on town heard it was great burger joint
4906,i ve been coming here and seeing amy jo for a few years now everytime im in the wax is excellent or s good as it can be given you are sitting down and willingly having hair torn from your body amy is careful and meticulous and i highly recommend her the schedule generally runs smoothly so you are generally in for your appointment on time the only negative would be the occasional less than friendly front desk staff however they turn over so quickly that it hardly matters to clarify on my most recent visit 05 2018 the staff was wonderful i was greeted kindly and my wait was minimal however in the past there have been instances where the front desk staff is less than friendly rude even however as of may 2018 it seemed to have been resolved
4907,took an afternoon tour on september 12th they take your picture as you get on so you can purchase a photo but we never saw where you get them as we spent most of the time on the open upstairs rear deck or bar while it was storming watching the shorelines and sights as we passed by it was relaxing but nothing much special about it as mostly just rusted hulks lining most of the mississipi shore line or trees and vegetation just the bucket list to ride on a paddlewheeler,there were four of us and we all enjoyed our meal after looking at some of the dishes that others in my party had i wanted to return another night and order theirs also however just not enough nights in my vacation to do that despite seeing the others plates my food was also very good we visited both the ghosts table and the sance room that is upstairs while there it was an interesting experience definitely would return two other highly hyped restaurants we went to couldn t even hold a candle to this one
4908,unlike st louis county there are not many great places to eat in the actual city of st louis this however is one of them good food professional staff the line takes awhile but considering how ridiculously busy they always are it is actually fast if you account for the crowd nice menu of sandwiches well made from quality fresh stuffs well complimented by a hipster variety of chips sodas and beers
4909,meh the pizza was underwhelming and relatively expensive for the small size i got they only offer three sizes small large and extra large new size just introduced but the small for around 18 was not worth the money the thin crust was crunchy had a light blackened taste it was good but the tomato sauce was too sweet and the pepperonis were kinda soggy the small size pizza was smaller than i d expect for the price as well
4910,i m so glad that mt juliet has an authentic indian restaurant we try to eat here at least once every couple of weeks the prices aren t bad at all and the food is amazing and so flavorful we really enjoy the garlic naan and have enjoyed every dish we ve tried from the biryanis to the chicken tikka masala to curry and more they take pride in making great authentic indian food and will make it as mild to as hot as you want it i have indian coworkers that bring me food occasionally and the taste is almost identical to their homemade dishes
4911,perfect location starbucks in new orleans business district while still close enough to the hotels in the area catering to both business and tourist crowd the barista are efficient polite and fast also the location is large enough for lounging if you want to hang out indoor in ac
4912,ok so i like miller s ale house fast service pretty good food goods drinks and great prices good place to watch the game
4913,slightly disappointed the bacon used on my grilled cheese looked to be the precooked bacon you buy in the packs at the grocery the mac cheese was cool at best not hot ordered cheese fries and barely enough to share sandwiches were good might come back to try a signature one i had the big cheesy my daughter an original and my husband had a crawgator we did take home leftover sandwiches bc they are big
4914,great meal came with a family of 5 kids 15 12 9 terrific food coffee and service try the biscuits i m not a biscuit person but they are spectacular we ordered a range of food from chicken and waffles to a healthy avocado breakfast all very good highly recommend
4915,being a huge fan of v street i was dying to try this place decided to order it off caviar one day and i was pretty happy with the results didn t taste too oily at all wiz fries are a must so delicious mushroom sandwich was my favorite one very filling for all seitan and veggies
4916,i foresee this bar becoming a new local fav great spot for amazing cocktails and you must try the bar burger it s the best burger in town brunch is also delicious i would recommend to anyone whether you re a local or just passing through
4917,great service awesome ice cream and water ice love going there staff is very pleasant and helpful with my family parking on site and that is great keep up the great job
4918,just overpowering sushi is all about the fish and everything here was about everything except the fish all the flavors were just so overpowering here and when you tried to isolate the fish it just wasn t the quality that i expect for sushi in comparison to some of the other local options i do think if you re someone who is all into strong flavors and the texture of the fish itself is less important you ll like this place and i can see this being some people s favorite sushi restaurant based on how strong the sauces are but for me it s just too much sauce if you re about the sauce and smells and you don t really like sushi this might be a good place to try to be introduced to sushi but if you like subtle flavors and really care about the mouthfeel and flavor of the fish i d give this place a pass
4919,my first time here on yesterday lunch service was great food was amazing the restaurant itself was so cool with the decorations i hope to be back oh and did i mention that pad thai tofu is amazing it wasn t the pad thai type noodles i expected but everything was good and tasty see you soon
4920,so let me start off by saying this is a 5 star restaurant because the food scene in indianapolis has nothing compared to this spot even though some of the food wasn t perfect in my opinion it s incredibly innovative and unique as a foodie i loved getting a peach tart that tasted like it had ginger and thyme undertones or the savory grits with a perfectly cooked egg that was used to bring a velvety texture throughout the dish even though it s pricey and not everything on the menu will be your favorite it is as special of a place as you will find in indianapolis
4921,only went here for a drink brandy milk punch on the patio which was fun the decor inside was awesome and it looks like a great place to eat
4922,whenever i ve walked past the corner of 20th and market at lunchtime i ve been distracted by the amazing smell of grilled meat there are no menus on the cart not even a sign let me tell you the soup nazi references are not ungrounded you don t order you get a cup of soup and are told to stand back and wait your turn when it comes you walk up to the cart and he talks about quality while preparing your meal when he s done you pay him 10 take the box containing your delicious eccentric meal of the day thank him and go your way grilled meat falafel rice greens fruits quite a few condiments sounds simple tastes amazing you will come back
4923,they have a larger selection of stuff to put into your bowl than most mongolian grills i have visited but the service is pretty awful and usually is every time i visit it is also waaaaay overpriced compared to other mongolian grills i have visited i do enjoy the sides they give you with your entree but my rice is never cooked well and the egg drop soup was slimy i only enjoy the sesame bread they also only offer all you can eat after 4pm and they have a sign that says they won t try to cook our oversized bowls that basically forces lunchtime people to make a giant bowl since they are paying 12 dollars for a single bowl it s an interesting way to do business on my last visit i was forced to bring my little sister with me who does not have a big appetite i went to go make her a children s bowl and was immediately confronted by an employee who told us the kids bowls were only for children 10 and under while i understand why that rule was in place the waitress was pretty rude about it and jumped on us the second we picked up a kids bowl literally right when we walked in having to pay the outrageous full price for my little sister was kind of aggravating especially because she barely ate any and the kids size was perfect for her needs i know they want to make money but the mediocre service is definitely not enough to keep repeat customers i only gave it 3 stars because the food isn t that bad
4924,staying in reno on a business trip found this place on yelp and stopped in for some brunch and to kill time before my flight home it s a quiet little spot and pretty empty when i came in i had the omelette with hash browns and a cup of coffee everything was fresh and delicious and cooked in front of you in their open layout kitchen the hashbrowns were of particular note cooked with quinoa kale and green onions that add a great depth of flavor the employees and owners were very friendly and let me stick around to do some reading and work on my laptop after i had finished my meal will certainly come back here next time i m in reno and i hope to see more restaurants like this pop up
4925,the service was remarkable the food exquisite and really deserves a 5 star rating unfortunately i cannot give the last star due to having to sit near patrons who brought in their two dogs this restaurant is known for its quality service and consistent great food as well as catering to locals and visitors alike but not everyone wants to be seated next to dogs even if they are really cute there are many restaurants in new orleans that welcomes and caters to our four legged friends but i don t believe a place such as muriel s is one of them we will go again but hopefully in a non animal section
4926,the best dentist i ve ever had in my life including family dentists she does work that is always above and beyond her office is filled with such skilled talented women everytime i enter the office there s a welcoming team greeting me i d recommend her and her team to all doreen powell
4927,fast friendly and fantastic sausage i was skeptical about their best sausage egg and cheese claim but they were right the sandwich gets 4 4 5 stars from my wife me simple unpretentious place we will be back i am curious about aunt millie s eggs
4928,we ordered from melt last night though waitr there was a problem with our order after a phone call to the restaurant they went out of their way to remedy the situation sandwiches were delicious fries crispy and tasty loved the mac and cheese but most of all the customer service was outstanding thanks y all
4929,the food was as good as it gets my daughter and i decided to have an early dinner and we both had had this place on the back burner so to speak after experiencing the lobster roll and the uconn roll and some fried shrimp to top it off we were sated and convinced that this place never needed to be on the back burner to start with it will go on our list of special places to go the batter on the calamari and the shrimp and the onion rings should not be called batter because it was light and flattered the dishes that it was used on this reminds me of some of my favorite seafront places to eat even though it was in a plain strip center on w hillsborough great food in down home surroundings
4930,okay i just love this place i m chinese and is personally not a fan of chinese food but this place it s always so good no matter when we order what we order or if were dining in or taking out this is me and hubby s go to place and we pretty much always get the same thing occasionally trying something different we always get the fried pork intestines pork intestines with pickled greens salted fish fried rice the bestttttt snow pea leaves and then depending on our mood we order a bunch of other stuff i got a whole lobster with ginger and scallion before it was ok but today i got the lobster with minced pork omg it was so good i just wish they used uber eats or something so i could get it delivered when i dont feel like coming out
4931,i love this place i come here all the time because it s close to my work i always get the chicken mendi chicken is usually juicy hot and so tender that it s falling off the bone service has aways been super fast and friendly rice is super flavourful everything tastes fresh big portion sizes and inexpensive can t recommend enough
4932,the portions are a lot bigger than they look my boyfriend and i went he s a very picky eater and we didn t think it would be enough we both ended up getting two meals out of our bowls phenomenal
4933,i love the ace and have frequented the portland palm springs and nyc hotels queen b amor is a stunningly gorgeous person who quickly served us and sat us down in a lovely location where we crossed paths with common and robert glasper show hands down robert glasper is the sickest musician on the planet and it was a joy to briefly talk with him as well thank you queen b amor and the ace for being a stunning musical venue
4934,new orleans is a fantastic food town you ll find it hard to find bad food at any of the restaurants we stopped here on a suggestion from a friend and i m sure happy that we did i ordered a po boy with sauted shrimp bacon and jalapeo add to this all of the great po boy toppings and you have quite a sandwich it was full of flavor and had a nice little bite with the jalapeos figuring prominently in the dish my wife had a roast beef po boy that was seasoned just right for that nola taste the creole house also had a fantastic and attentive waiter who kept checking on us and definitely deserved the tip that we gave him
4935,excellent happy hour if you can get a seat at the bar i stayed there all night once i managed to nab a stool a nice dude and total stranger bought me and another new friend i made sitting in my other side tequila shots thanks miles it was the girl on my left s 21st bday do yourself a favor and get the crab salad as an appetizer with those airy chips i loved the hint of grainy mustard and the huge pieces of crab i also tried the smoked fish spread as a starter and thoroughly enjoyed their shrimp and grits the bartender kristoffer recommended i add lump crab to the s g ummmmm yes please it was divine thanks kristoffer and staff
4936,yes the food was brilliant yes the cocktails were delicious that should be self evident what s more important is that i got excited reviewing the menu not just intrigued but genuinely excited there was gesticulation outburst of oh my lord yes and conversations with other diners it isn t just food it s the warm glow of summer in the mexican highlands squarely in the middle of indy
4937,we re from palm springs and we were coming home from vacation as we passed through santa barbara we were lucky enough to have dinner at the bluewater grill it was fabulous chanel the chef marco the sous chef carly our server we re all awesome the women and men behind the kitchen we re creative and worked so hard to deliver a great meal our selections were delicious and the service was great anytime you re passing through please stop and say hello to these folks you won t be disappointed we promised the manager colin and danielle the hostess that we would post a review on yelp the food the crabcakes were delish this sandabs and the potatoes au gratin were fabulous the blackened halibut was awesome and the paella was so flavorful a dish you don t always see on the menu thank you bluewater grill see you again
4938,been going to snows for years any other nail shops i have been to the nails popped off within a week only nail shop i recommend
4939,great atmosphere and great food the portion sizes are out of this world i had no idea what i was getting myself into made to order fresh and tasty owner and staff were welcoming and amazing definitely a neighborhood feel and spot to add to our list will be coming back to try lunch and dinner
4940,this is the first time staying at anglers cove and we will be back we stayed in room 206 which had a great view of the beach and ocean i believe two of the rooms also had ocean views which was nice the unit was very spacious and very clean we were able to use the fully stocked kitchen every night to make family meals which is very important to us we also loved the toy box they supply by the pool for beach toys and honestly the bed in the master bedroom was so comfortable i slept so well during our stay staff was very welcoming and friendly especially chris who went out of his way to make sure our stay was perfect it was so nice to stay directly on the beach in such a fantastic condo
4941,this was awesome i had never had chicago style pizza before and i was super excited to try it the restaurant was clean and nice the staff was super nice the pizza was cooked perfectly with a crispy crust lots of cheese and fresh sauce the calamari was so crispy and a fun twist with the fried lemon and artichoke in there as well we had a tiny mix up that we didn t even care about and yet the waitress and manager treated us so nicely thank you
4942,loved the salmon poke bowl that i get here we ve been two times so far and really love the freshness of the fish not to mention nice sized cuts and the sushi rice and the easy drive thru makes this our current go to spot excited to go eat there next week
4943,delicious everything our group of four ordered was delicious it s a popular local place so plan on making your reservation on open table and plan accordingly
4944,i love going into this place to just browse and see what trendy item i can blow my money on living near mass ave shopping can be limited but also very competitive between silver in the city boomerang boutique global gifts and homespun you pretty much can find whatever you are looking for as far as gifts go silver in the city is always my go to first they are always on top of the newest it items for your home and style they also allow dogs in their store so that s a huge plus because i m typically walking my dog when i stop in the only reason i am not giving them five stars is that although their employees are super friendly they definitely watch you i understand the need for this because they have little items that probably get stolen a lot but i always feel like i have no privacy to browse and debate any purchases cheers
4945,my best friend and i had an amazing dinner here on our nye trip the menu and flavor execution are out of this world highlights include the fried chicken and the crispy avocado rice which sounds uninspiring but is truly out of this world service was attentive and friendly but not overbearing which i find to be the case sometimes in the south restaurant was well decorated and the open kitchen really adds to the ambience deducting half a star for the hostess stand despite having a reservation and greeting the hostess she proceeded to answer the phone mid conversation with me and carry on a 2 minute conversation with the caller instead of placing her on hold and finishing the conversation we had already commenced otherwise she was sweet enough but seemed like she was too overwhelmed to maintain decorum
4946,from the initial phone call to the final walk around inspection this process was exemplary of great customer service the phone was answered by someone who knew the process had the authority to price match make appointment and let me know what to expect upon arrival i was greeted with paperwork already in order ready for my review the technician who came out was my technician and stayed with my vehicle until it was done i added a few items without hassle the final product and installation exceeds my expectations i would recommend doing one s homework get some prices then call clearview and breathe easily knowing it will be taken care of expeditiously without drama
4947,the breakfast is always cooked just right and this is a fun place to eat nothing fancy just a great place to go highly recommended
4948,busy place yet the service doesn t suffer great menu get the sun dried beef prepared however many options so good i d damn near eat it off of my shoe
4949,i know how hard it is to leave your pet but if you have to leave them this is a really nice place i have boarded my dog here several times in the past year he is well taken care of the staff is very friendly and helpful cannot say enough about the lodge at new tampa excellent
4950,if you decide to eat here just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end we have tried it multiple times because i want to like it i have been to it s other locations in nj and never had a bad experience the food is good but it takes a very long time to come out the waitstaff is very young but usually pleasant we have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting we usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends in order to be done quicker
4951,as a person that s been going to capital grille and the palm since i was 9 have to say i am very very impressed by the meal and service i got here tonight the filet and delmonico was the perfect medium and medium rare the twice baked tomatoes were awesome and the apple pie is the best apple pie i ever had and i can t even believe the cinnamon ice cream is real definitely will bring everyone i can here
4952,went there for the first time 2 nights ago and had a great meal had a couple of apps including the vegetable sampler and the seekh kabab all of which were very good for entres two in the party got various types of chicken kababs both of which were very good one kabab had some sort of mint marinade and so the chicken was green but delicious i had a vegetarian entree which was also very good my son got butter chicken also good serving sizes kind of small but in keeping with other indian restaurants that i ve been to in the past we got a couple naan orders also the best one was one that was stuffed with a raisin nut mixture delicious overall the service was very good and the establishment was clean would go again in future
4953,i recently had an exceptionally positive experience at d b tailors i had one custom suit made and had alterations done on four other ill fitting suits which all were made elsewhere the custom suit made by gabe fit perfectly my body isn t an easy fit due to sloping shoulders one shoulder higher than the other a barrel chest and narrow waist most suit jackets gape out at the chest when i button them but not this one it drapes smoothly with just enough taper from the chest to the waist interestingly of the many bespoke suits i ve had made gabe was the only craftsman who seemed to notice the idiosyncrasies of my body and adjust accordingly it was clear he had a complete understanding of what needed to be done and how to do it gabe also successfully rehabilitated my other four suits making them all fit better and look better in both the pants and the jackets i couldn t be happier it was easily my best experience with bespoke clothing bar none i have nothing but the highest respect and admiration for a man that has perfected his craft to the degree gabe has simply a legend
4954,i cannot find any restaurants that serves better raviolis i get them every time i go for the most part unless something catches my eye on the weekly special menu which is always booming with kick ass options service is okay but never he best but good atmosphere and drinks tip stay away from window seats during cold seasons its cold and very uncomfortable when trying to enjoy your meal
4955,took half of our family for dinner and was so pleased with our service and our delicious food and we tried like half of the menu our waitress was the sweetest and everyone was so tending to our many needs we will definitely return desert was even better and i highly recommend the pizza
4956,best donuts i ve had s o insisted that we only needed one donut each and we both regretted that decision they had around 6 or 8 options which all looked amazing i think their options are seasonal kinda pricey but definitely worth it hell i contemplate driving 11 hours for these donuts on a regular basis
4957,the ticket clinic has always managed to help me with my tickets i m not sure why all the negative reviews but it has worked out great for me
4958,veeeeery good thin slices pizza awesome truffle fries good selection of wine apothic is gooooood
4959,jim jg is awesome we knew the transmission on my pickup was going he fervently tried to keep it going before the inevitable blow up well the trans rebuild has been solid it will never blow up again thanks to an external trans cooler you get what you pay for this thing has been dynamite maybe 5 years now he has also serviced my transfer case u joints and hubs he will not do unnecessary repairs i highly recommend his shoppe
4960,delicious and healthy plus the people that work there are so nice the inside is small but enough tables to sit for lunch with one or two friends great drink options as well the tea is really yummy
4961,you can t believe the choices in hot chocolate you can get there and all so yummy on a cold winter day not too sweet the drink hits the spot wish it wasn t so cold i would have had ice cream
4962,such a friendly and cute atmosphere husband loved the cookie dough as he s a fan of it in general my first time ever trying cookie dough and it was okay would recommend for all the cookie dough lovers
4963,delicious a great outdoor seating area and the food was so good i had to visit a second time service was attentive and not constantly interrupting us i could go back there every single day if possible the lemoncello after your meal is a nice touch
4964,came here just for their taiwan beef noodle soup was spicier than expected but overall there was a lot of flavor in the broth the best broth i think actually but could be due to the oil in it portions of beef was great since the price for a bowl was under 7 would come back here again as the noodle soup was good and service was fine
4965,awesome service food try the lobster mac cheese
4966,we decide to make it a once a year trip at least from the orlando area this place will scare for the amount of people that will pass through don t let it it s well organized just decided what you want pick a number and they will serve you within 5 mins top we bought 5 6 cheeses a couple of dry meats and a bottle of cannonau wine enjoyed it in the patio and left after closing the brunch with an amaretto ball and a sfogliatella buy sfogliatelle before they are gone they run out in less than 1 2 hours so worth it
4967,aaaaah man landry s seafood house was awesome me and my fianc sat upstairs by the window and had a nice view of the water our server nathan was great and very attentive as well the bartender made amazing drinks and the food was on point we had the crab cake oysters and a shrimp poy boy everything was made exceptionally well definitely a must visit when in nawlins
4968,i had the traditional breakfast two eggs bacon toast and fruit and split the french toast with friends it was good i have to say my favorite part was their english breakfast tea made with a french press and fresh honey delicious it s slightly on the pricey side but you are in santa barbara in the touristy section
4969,wife and i planned a weekend getaway in reno with our 2 year old we basically just planned on lounging in the room and going to the pool and that was about it we got to the front desk to check in having already made a reservation requesting a room with a king bed the person said they didn t have any king rooms left and would have to put us in a different room with 2 beds we explained that we had made our reservation already for a king bed and she said i will see what i can do but can t promise anything she came back to the counter after a few mins and said she had gotten a king bed room for us the room was clean and nice we ordered room service getting a pizza for dinner and it was really good the pool area is big with several different pools to go into but they were all super busy and it was tough finding a chair if you get there too late aside from that the pool was great servers come around for drinks and there are cabanas available to rent for a few hundred bucks i believe we had hit the buffet for lunch and there was a good selection of food and it all tasted pretty good but later that night i felt pretty sick from it i hadn t eaten anything else that day so i m pretty sure it was the buffet that did it all staff was really kind and took care of anything we needed the arcade is decent size but not really much for out daughter at 2 years old to do so we took her over to circus circus to play around but she for sure loved the pool we will for sure be back to this place may just skip on the buffet i hear the steak place across the street is pretty good might hit that instead
4970,cindy is the best great food and service food is authentic and so is the staff everything is made fresh and you can taste the difference from other mexican restaurants at first bite i would recommend to anyone that enjoys mexican cuisine
4971,of course chick fil a is great but this franchise consistently has the slowest service compared to any other franchise i ve ever been to word to the wise when you see a long line move on somewhere else
4972,they were great had a new person training and they even gave me the left over but smoothie in the blender first time i ve had that happen to me anywhere sweet
4973,so i had only been to a restaurant with the same name in san diego so i was excited to see it was also in greenwood the chicken teriyaki sandwich is worth getting the largest size the teriyaki sauce is embedded in the chicken unlike any other thing you may eat with teriyaki the fries are more than you can handle with the large sandwich so save them for later the staff working were great and helpful
4974,the pancakes are so good the strawberry pancakes are my favorite even the coffee is good definitely a nashville tradition but too hard to get into there is always a long wait to get in
4975,quick review 3 let me fist say that i am not a fan of drinking spirits straight we had friends who asked us to go to their free tasting they offer the first friday of the month atmosphere 3 the building is in an old hardee s you can tell they are making improvements it s a new business so that is how i gave the rating otherwise i would have given a 1 it is in need of a lot of work food none staff 4 the owner gets a five star but the one bartender was a bit slow there was a long line to wait in to get drinks drinks 3 they do offer mixed drinks the one i had was good it was tiny for 8 again i can not drink spirits without a mixer all in all 3 we might go back for a tasting if we are in the area and because it s near 4 hands
4976,i called this morning because my lexus was making a bad sound when it went over bumps mary told me i could come right over and a few hours later and with a new pair of rear struts my car drives like new they saw the problem immediately and fixed it the same day i don t know enough about cars to know say whether the prices are reasonable but the entire staff was friendly helpful and responsive i will definitely be back
4977,the best al pastor tacos i have ever had they cut the meat right in front of you and give you plenty of it for each taco the burrito bowl is also delicious everything is well cooked and it s the most filling option we picked up and enjoyed it with some homemade margaritas perfect date night in
4978,very engaging server brittany and bartender fiona who were both happy to accommodate me and my family and make delicious bartender s choice drinks and the olives were amazing really cute de or as well
4979,we ate here for the first time and really enjoyed it the first impression for me is the clean fresh look and feel of the restaurant no smell of fish in a fish restaurant is a good thing they are kid friendly the staff is over all friendly last but not least the food is delicious i ordered the crab blt with a side of homemade potato chips they have generous portions too incredible i can t wait to go back
4980,their omelete of local crab is absolutely phenomenal this will be my official go to breakfast place in new orleans
4981,i stopped by for a last minute sunday brunch not expecting the love to go beyond my expectations the interior is clean and inviting and the staff are friendly and helpful we ordered a number of side dishes the burger and some eggs and they all came out great if you re looking for true southern food i wouldn t say this is it but i still found their menu appetizing and delicious i would recommend this and will be returning
4982,i came here because i passed by while walking around in the french quarter the day before their grand opening i decided to try it out a week later and was so happy that i did the food was delicious the fried gulf fish fingers were amazing as well as the shrimp crabmeat claiborne dip and i also had the peacemaker sandwich these were all recommendations from our waitress who was super friendly and spot on with everything the waitstaff was very friendly and always checking in on us i highly recommend coming here this is the sister restaurant of creole cafe will definitely be back the next time i m in town
4983,amazing food and fantastic service steve was our server and he was great our cups of coffee were never half empty they offer delicoius food in generous portions using top quality ingredients this will be my new favorite go to location in the exton area
4984,this has some of the best mexican comfort food in town tortillas have to be the best in tucson beans are soooooo good never can go wrong with anything here i ve been eating here for a long time the only things i ve noticed over time is that the crew that works in the evening isn t as on point as the day crew
4985,cambria was nothing but wonderful the beds were incredibly comfortable and the rooms for immaculate we got free drinks our room upgraded and prosecco when they found out it was our honeymoon the bar staff was friendly and full of tips for the town the gym was huge and we would stay here again in a heartbeat we appreciated that they had covered parking for a fee on location as we are driving cross country the friendly staff and neat decor makes this stay even better we were on a higher floor and the veiws were amazing brenna at the front desk was amazing walking distance to downtown 10 10
4986,decent food and decor nothing special i had shrimp risotto and it was undercooked but at least the garlic sauce had some flavor pineapple express mixed drink was good and the service was adequate having a window seat overlooking the bay was nice but didn t justify the prices on the menu location is pretty much the only reason we came here and overall it wasn t worth the trip will look elsewhere for better seafood
4987,ehhh i mean it s convenient but that s about it we have no shortage of good coffee spots in the area so you really have to be either a nice and pleasant when customers say hello or what s up and or offer something amazing that justifies being so bothered by customers wanting to give you their money i ve been in here maybe 3 times and every time i ve left feeling with something to be desired the iced coffee was fine smoothie was pure sugar water and the iced matcha was was again fine but sugary and no question of what kind of milk would you like as you will be asked at most other coffee shops i tried to engage with the barista at the counter each time but nothing i get the whole i m a barista not here to socialize thing but at least be courteous and greet us with a hello and some kinds of thank you your welcome peace offering when we grab our drink at the bar maybe a have a good one anything really to make us feel good about walking away with a mediocre drink and baristas who are probably talking about us the second we leave with alchemy and one shot less than a block away i d spend the extra dollar or 2 to feel good when leaving it s that simple
4988,love this place veggie friendly and affordable staff is always prompt they take cards which is a major plus
4989,first time here and wont be the last i had the best haircut i ve ever gotten i can t remember the gentlemen s name though came in and gave him the idea of what i wanted he executed it perfectly i ve seen the same barber for a long time now and wanted a change up this will not be the last time here for me
4990,man this place was fire the devil eggs to start off were fabulous and for a meal i got the red beans and rice and they were just spicy enough but not to hot my wife got the macaroni and cheese and i tried some and have to say that it s probably the best i have ever had also i tried the roast beef pot boy and it was great too drinks are great and great atmosphere just all around a great place to go come see jeff when u come in he was great as well also my buddy had the the oysters raw and he said they was really good as well must try this place out
4991,really good can be a wait but it moves quickly we are loveless fans and wanted to try something different although everything was good it just doesn t compare to the loveless pecan pancakes and sweet potato pancakes is what we had along with their hash browns again all good but just doesn t compare to loveless very nice area with lots of boutique shopping close
4992,very southern very heavy it was on tv so i take my touristy friends sometimes but i never really come here
4993,i am in st louis for business and my colleagues and i were starving after a long day at the office the service is excellent and so were the food and beverage we all had steaks and were all very pleased with the way they were prepared and tasted i would highly recommend carmine s for a nice steak dinner
4994,great place for some yummy and authentic food service was great and the place was clean
4995,my husband i went to use a groupon that i bought for him for father s day it was a great time the groupon had expired but they let us use the amount paid for the groupon as a credit towards anything at the bar we each had a flight and the beer was good
4996,i came here after a 3 day backpacking trip and received one of the best most thoughtful massages of my life from summer i wish i lived in the boise area so i could go back for another i had asked for hot stone and aromatherapy and summer suggested adding cupping and it was so worth it the perfect trifecta i would recommend summer to anyone
4997,this place has some good breakfast burritos they re huge and i recommend getting salsa and sour cream to go with them
4998,chef s market is always good i ve tried almost all of their offerings and have never been disappointed i like the salad trio for lunch you select 3 salads from a myriad of choices curried chicken salad italian pasta salad avocado and corn salad with your choice of house baked roll delicious one of my dinner favorites is short ribs with jack daniels sauce and a choice of 2 hot veggie sides their sweet potato casserole is crazy good but i like the roasted potatoes and vegetable saute with the short ribs dessert omg the cakes are to die for you will not be able to eat a whole piece be sure to take a look they re in the front case
4999,crowed loud and busy but there s a good reason for all of that and that s because the view the food and the service are top notch randi was our server and i fell in love with her but she wasn t available for take out she was extremely professional and covered all of her tables with the same enthusiastic smile and warm southern charm our food was good but the specialty drinks from the outside bar were amazing to say the least other than the high temperatures and loud noises from the surrounding customers there was nothing bad to say here for this trip did i mention randi what a dream come true i d return just to sip drinks in her section and enjoy the view of her amazing smile
5000,this place is awesome the food tastes homecooked and seems to use good ingredients they give you a huge coffee cup which was fun i had french toast and beacon and loved it
5001,i stopped by for lunch and a cocktail this week the food was solid and service was great i was most impressed with their french 75 cocktail it is one of my faves and theirs is the best i ve ever tried i had to get one to go haha
5002,we visited rotten ralph s with friends after dropping our kids off at college the weather was nice for a thursday evening so we decided to sit outside which as nice and quaint we were abruptly approached by an older female employee who inna very nasty manner told us we could move the tables as we had done i joked that she must be rotten ralph s wife anyway waiter came and apologized and laughed it off and said we should t mind her because she s miserable to everyone moving along our waitress was new but very nice i being in philadelphia ordered a cheesesteak that was topped with cheese and fried onions i found the bun to be fresh and the meat cheese ratio was perfect the bar although slow was difficult to get our beers and soda in a timely manner once our meal came drinks seemed to roll out much quicker the one thing that stood out to me was the fact that 90 of the food came out at the same time but one person in our group had to wait 15 minutes for her chicken ceasar salad we had a similar experience with our beverages one person got their beer nearly 15 minutes after everyone else and the waitress was nowhere to be found the food is good but they really need to brush up on their service
5003,this is yet another review saying that the shrimp and grits was the best we ve ever tasted because it was we also had the bananas foster french toast i never order sweet brunch foods but oh man it was so good i made the right choice plan for a wait but know that it will be worth it
5004,step out of the ordinary and enjoy some extraordinary italian food this is not not the typical italian katie s unique twist to her dishes knock those restaurants out of the park we tried the pear pizza and the fig and squash pizza without pancetta both were delicious the table is centered with extra olive oil and chili oil which you can add to enhance or spice up your meal always remember with better ingredients come elevated prices expect to pay a little more for these fresher healthier dishes katie s also delivers excellent service that is knowledgeable quick and accurate we were not disappointed in the service they seated us quickly and served us efficiently what stops this place from being a five the prices did effect my rating while seafood and fresh ingredients are frequently listed on the menu i have experience fresh larger in portion size meals that were lower in price my own personal bias also effected the rating italian is not my favorite so it is based primarily on my personal taste if this review were over italian food it would be a five so next time you want to take an afternoon or evening and step out of the traditional st louis italian try katie s pizza you ll take your taste buds on an adventure
5005,i m usually not a burger person but my friend insisted that we try this place out since it was apparently the best burger they have ever had i ordered the whiskey burger i will admit this is the best burger i have ever had it literally has all of my fave burger toppings all in one burger the burger could definitely feed two people i barely finished it haha the service was great and the bar tenders were excellent thanks for making me gain 5 lbs noregrets
5006,love this salon i ve been going for a few years and currently work with laura she is fabulous down to earth kind and gave me the most amazing chin length do today she s an artist i always leave feeling less stressed and so glad i went
5007,wonderful dinner with friends this husband wife team have the most innovative food that we have found in town our server was very helpful friendly and attentive the restaurant is small with tables and counter service al fresco dining available after reading reviews the grilled octopus and the burger stood out as special we ordered one each of the 2 octopus preparations as appetizers and enjoyed both the burgers were as anticipated a mix of incredible flavors served on a pretzel bun enjoyed by 2 of us a special a lentil dish with chicken was excellent and an accompanying chardonnay recommended by our server and unknown to us was a complex very nice wine we really enjoyed the food and the overall experience the only negative is the noise level the hard surfaces reflect sound making conversation difficult at times will return
5008,had a great time at the club just don t get there early i got there at about 5 30 pm when the club opened up at six when i was approached by a person it was washing the windows behind me he s a fraud he verbally violated me since i have disability he told me i was being a nuisance when i wasn t bothering anyone just because i was standing too close to the entrance then when i got some assistance to move by someone a passerby he proceeded to have a confrontation with me but i stood up for myself i have no mercy on what happens to this particular person and i hope that karma has no mercy on him either i ll definitely be back again at the club had a good time despite this stupid person so everyone just be careful out there
5009,this is the best thai restaurant that we have found in the newport richie pasco county area the quality and the amount of the food is excellent the food is quite tasty and they make it to your liking as far as spiciness is concerned the service is excellent and there is a discount for cash payment a great place to eat for any occasion
5010,a girlfriend and i had dinner here friday june 8 2018 food was fantastic i had the tortilla soup which was delicious and a large portion i love how they served all of the add ins on the side such as cheese chicken and avocado my friend had a steak quesadilla which she said was also great the servers were very attentive their signs states authentic and i would have to agree that their food definitely tasted authentic looking forward to more tortilla soup
5011,this is a great neighborhood spot they have a great bar with a good spread of bourbons more importantly the crawfish beignet is a must that dish was on diners drive ins and dives it was the tastiest thing i had during my trip in nola so far there was a healthy amount of crawfish in it as well as good sauce and cheese although it had jalapeos it wasn t too spicy as far as the entree it was ok i had the redfish nola i liked the reddish i liked the shrimp and there was a nice amount of crab meat however it lacked a good carb there was like 1 little red potato and i would have liked a sauce so although it tasted fine it wasn t memorable
5012,best plumber in the area i have used mr ecker for over five years now and every time i get honest work at a fair price mr ecker does a lot of work on his own so if you have to wait for a little bit i would suggest waiting if you want whatever issue you have to be remedied correctly,if i was giving this review prior to my last visit the rating would have been five stars i ve been eating at gypsy for years and always loved their lobster mac and cheese and crabby fries however at my last visit the lobster mac and cheese is now only offered in one size and they took the crabby fries off the menu i was highly disappointed at this lobster mac and cheese was still good but i feel as though the price point is a little much for what you get now maybe the owners reevaluated their menu and thought they were losing money i don t know but my enthusiasm for going here has definitely dipped i will return i love the lobster mac cheese that much i hope they bring the crabby fries back they were sooooo good
5013,even better than the rave reviews real folded croissant dough generously filled and expertly baked to perfection kudos to the chef high quality staff for a top notch french breakfast eggs were light fluffy could not have been better
5014,place is a bit uncomfortable given the cramped space which meant wait staff kind of suddenly appear over your shoulder and struggle to get plates on off the table special of the night octopus was well cooked but was way too garlicky tasted as if garlic had burned in the oil fished out and recooked with fresh garlic not nice pasta dishes were good and generous portion overall service was fast and food reasonable but ambience was a bit creepy
5015,literally my favorite place to eat in brentwood for a casual lunch or dinner their mexican caesar is to die for but i get the siracha tzaziki dressing because it s way less calories best salads hands down you can get around here
5016,absolutely fantastic menu fairly small menu but all cooked to perfection service is speedy and friendly one of my favorite spots
5017,great little place ordered the pastor tacos and the chicken empanadas i loved the tacos and the fact that they put pineapples in the taco which really enhanced the flavor of the pastor i thought the empanadas were okay i probably wouldn t get them again the service was good and you do have to find street parking
5018,my rv radiator exploded on a road trip and adam from big dave s came to the rescue we were pulled over on the side of the highway with speeding semis and when adam got to us he immediately started getting the rv hooked up to get us out of that danger zone polite efficiency is what comes to mind and when we got to our destination he expertly drove his huge truck towing a 26 rv and did a 3 point turn to find the obscure driveway we were looking for after dark we just want to say thank you so much to adam
5019,we had dinner here while staying at the intercontinental down the block after a few days in nola we were a little tired of the lines so i turned to yelp to find something nearby without the word line in every single review im so happy we landed on cafe at the square we had the french onion soup fried green tomatoes alligator sausage and grilled redfish topped with crab everything was on point except the veggies served along with the redfish were a little beyond soggy and the potatoes could ve been crispier minus one star because it somewhat lacks a decent atmosphere due to way too bright lighting and something else i can t put my finger on if you re looking for good food quick service and great value you won t go wrong here
5020,this place is amazing everything is modern and cool prices are reasonable and the food is amazing you have to try their french toast at least once in your life i also didn t know it was byob so that s a nice little plus if you like that they also cater to vegetarians and vegans with some great food so my friends and i enjoyed that too there s also not that long of wait for your food either which surprised me the first time i went this place is great if you re going with your friends or family everyone should try this place at least once
5021,i love this store i could have spent all day in there purchased a rug and some other decorations barbara was so helpful in making the arrangements to have the rug delivered to our home in orange county i would highly recommend if you are in santa barbara go by the store carol
5022,it simply does not get any better than tako for sushi everything is fresh delicious the private rooms are so fun for a festive night out it s byo when my girls get together we enjoy the feast atmosphere some personal favorites are the jalapeo yellowtail a must kani salad bird s nest roll the naruto served in cucumber instead of rice honestly you can t go wrong when ordering and so reasonable i rarely spend over 35 including tip when we go and we do not hold back at all when ordering highly highly recommend tako
5023,thank you for the kinda words i agree that restaurants do have off nights and i appreciate your response it was very busy so that s a good sign i hope a few of those issues can be addressed in the future and i would be happy to come back the bread and dipping sauce is definitely one of my favorites my updated review is based on my first experience there which was a good one take care
5024,suzie is great professional efficient personable everything you d want in an aesthetician i ve been going to her for years and i will for years to come
5025,cute little place for breakfast healthy options and great flavors its different from the typical breakfast place that is just usually pancakes and toast would go again
5026,loooooooove this place the ambiance is nice the food is great and the staff is friendly everything on the menu is delicious but my favorite way to end my meal is with the churros and chocolate definitely the best part i would recommend this place a thousand times over for a good breakfast meet up with friends
5027,ate lunch here today with my parents and we were beyond impressed we ordered a cuban sandwich the turkey avocado sandwich and the 51st philly cheesesteak we also got a side of tortilla chips and sides of guacamole and pico de gallo the sandwiches were huge and absolutely delicious the guac and pico were both very fresh and very tasty the prices were great the employees were very friendly i will definitely be back to try other sandwiches and the tacos as well
5028,we ate there last night a wonderful restaurant our waiter suggested the mussels which were great service was spectacular easy parking will return
5029,possibly my favorite lunch place in brentwood everything i ve tried has been delicious and fresh you can see them cooking the service is great and the staff is so friendly also love supporting this local small business
5030,gavin djed our wedding at the riviera mansion and i cannot express enough what a great job he did he has a portion of his website where you can select songs and give him a good sense of the music you would like played gavin flawlessly chose music that fit the event throughout cocktail hour dinner and dancing our dance floor was packed the entire night and many of our guests commented on how great the music was gavin was also flexible to some last minute suggestions and changes we could not recommend him highly enough thank you
5031,great place for brunch i m a college student here and breakfast was fantastic and fair prices highly recommend
5032,we have used yong s alterations since they opened in their previous location all of our important alterations wife children my own have been entrusted to them their response is terrific quality unmatched and prices more than reasonable yong s has cared for our clothing through growth diet weddings funerals last minute emergencies and always delivered beyond expectation i can t fathom a poor review unless the customer didn t give the team a chance to address the error jessica seemed willing to give below a 1 without an opportunity to even bring to the shop s attention to correct i d give a 10 as have experienced their quality work for over three decades you won t find a better friendlier and more responsive expert to bring your clothes to life on your body absolutely the best
5033,nothing bundt cakes is a great place to go if you want to bring someone a gift or a treat for yourself if you sign up for their birthday club you can get a free mini cake and they re not small they offer samples and a variety of different flavors like praline and red velvet the people that work there are very kind why not stop by and treat yourself to something sweet,this market is beautiful it makes you want to buy everything i like their precooked foods everything i ve had has been delicious this is a great place to grab something to eat and sit outside in the winter months there is a fire pit near the tables where you can order from the outside of the store also a great place to bring a date it s casual and there are so many choices you re sure to find something delicious even for the most picky eater the butcher almost always has something on special ask and he will tell you what the best deals are there were three items that i haven t been able to find anywhere else since i was in the verge of buying them online i happily snatched them up i ll be back soon
5034,magical vegan heaven my wife and i stopped here on a detour from our route back home to boston and she a non vegan devoured their philly steak i literally had to pry her away from ordering more i don t blame her at all though because the food was damn good i had the curry tofu wrap and it was delicious the place is pretty small with limited seating so a lot of people were taking and i m assuming regularly take their food to go so i d be wary of this if you re wanting to sit in but yeah this place rocks their kale lemonade alone is worth the 5 stars next time we re in philly this place will be among the first in which we stuff our faces,not sure why this place was listed as being closed as the wife and i stopped here tonight on our way back home through delaware and we had the best time the lady who works there who i believe owns the store with her husband is extremely friendly and helpful and the store is magical they have a newly made 18 mini section filled with naughty goodies pillows doujinshi inexpensive scrolls that ll make you blush and a surprisingly extensive amount of merch like full scale figures and little plushes keychains they have fun things like an archway to string up tanabata wishes and a little lottery to win prizes it s like every anime fan s dream home and a truly lovely place we ll be back
5035,we love the craft cocktails and craft beers the food is hit and miss the batter on the fish and chips doesn t hold up it s soggy and gross the quality of the fish is good but a new batter recipe is mandatory their classic burger is good and so are the fries
5036,i moved a little under a year ago every time i come back to visit i make a stop at this amazing place the staff is magnificent there s always something new to find
5037,this is going to be our new hangout great ambiance and great food selection is awesome gotta start with the crab fries spicy is on point
5038,this beer is in my top 3 breweries in boise i like that there s always a food truck i like that you can bring dogs and kids here
5039,beef bbq brisket thumbs upp booze good n strong got the rock you huurricane rum disarronno drink service excellent nice decorations
5040,quite average at least based on what i ordered in terms of food i ordered the chicken sandwich and that was pretty average the spicy sauce that came with it wasnt bad added a kick to the sandwich bread was ok while eating the sandwich i had visions of going across the street to order a spicy chicken sandwich from shake shack that would have been a way better option since at 12 a pop and no fries not great the 6 duck fat fries were ok i have had way better in baltimore by way of drinks i had the fruit punch lol literally tasted like a fruit punch with little or no alcohol the commodore which i ordered was a way better drink don t even waste your time on the fruit punch service was great i obviously wasn t in the mood for a burger so maybe those are killer
5041,what a gem great wines relaxed atmosphere very helpful staff absolutely fresh delicious food we had the dates pea hummus and risotto all delicious we will go back the doorman was sweet and talented
5042,exactly as bougie and casual at the same time as you need it to be come with your gucci bag or in your yoga pants and slam a delicious cocktail or three
5043,ate brunch here this morning they were short staffed but managing bartender was friendly and working very hard we ordered everyone else around us ordered ate and left we still had no food the bartender had the manager check on it he brought us out our food my louisiane wasn t hot and only had 1 oyster on it my husbands bayou bowl was hot but had the wrong type of eggs drinks were good but no apology from the manager at all 2 hrs to eat so make sure you are ready to wait the food was good but i doubt i make this a regular return spot on our trips
5044,i love their food their drunken noodles and pad thai are the bomb their curries especially green curry is delicious
5045,amazing outside diner one of my favorite places to visit in nola love the live music steamboat willie and his band perform nightly best live jazz on bourbon street try the hurricane if you are looking for something to sip on while enjoying the music cant wait to visit nola again i will be sure to visit cafe beignet when i do
5046,amazing food and great service by far one of the best indian restaurants i have ever eaten at i was visiting from atlanta and my friend brought me here i ve been hooked every since and anytime i visit philadelphia this is a spot i have to go to
5047,this place is great super nice waitress and the chef came out to make sure everything was good delish and will be back kids eat free on saturday until 3p
5048,best donuts ever light fluffy always fresh fast and friendly service always if you love apple fritters like i do go early or they re gone
5049,i really wanted to like milk and honey but we had a pretty average meal here my streak was over cooked and tough to chew other meals were nothing to write home about they were also out of some of the whiskey s on the menu and dessert items in a city with so many great options won t be back
5050,this was my second time eating here and it did not disappoint if you want to make it here for dinner be sure to go early or you will have to wait my family of four tried to come around 7 30pm last time and the wait was an hour so we were disappointed to have to drive all this way and not get seated even though we called ahead of time and was told that there was no wait this time our family of five got in right before seven and was seated right away we came here for the fresh uni we ordered both specials of the day fresh uni and king salmon we also ordered the happy meal stolen treasure spicy dan dan noodles and the mixed feed me menu of five course non raw and raw items the feed me menu came with fried pompano lion s head soup tuna rose lemonfish rose and raw pompano with yellow kiwi the food came pretty quickly and very presentable the portions are on the small side everything we ordered was delicious except the cheese they added on the king salmon was out of place and almost ruined the culinary experience the uni by itself was a great experience i ve never had uni mixed in a citrus twist before i ve had it at sushi restaurants with a thin slice of lemon or straight out of the shell for the ultimate oceanic briny taste another slight error was the miscommunication between the waiter and the chef the chef told our waiter that our table was done with the food when we didn t get any of the raw items we ordered from the feed me menu luckily i said something or we would have not been able to try the great lemonfish the chef personally brought out our last dish the raw pompano and apologized for the long wait for our food which made the dinner all the better another plus about luvi is that they have a machine that seals the cups like at the boba tea place for kids drinks and drinks to go follow them on instagram so you can see when they have uni overall this is a great culinary experience but if you have a big appetite you might leave here not fully satiated because of the small portions both times that i visited luvi i had to grab gelato at piccola gelateria afterwards
5051,this was a good sit down asian restaurant it wasn t the best asian food i have had but it was satisfying the prices were not outrageous for the classiness of the space the food came fast and the waiter was friendly overall we were very satisfied with the dinner
5052,we ordered 2 speciality concretes a frozen custard with mix ins one was banana pudding themed and the other was a cherry chocolate pie both were outstanding delicious custard base with a healthy serving of delicious toppings ordered 2 small sized specialty concretes which was the perfect amount for us to share service was friendly and quick you order and pick up at a window only seating outside this would also be easy to pick up and take to go and enjoy at home
5053,this is a cozy place and great for date nights there is a parking lot across the street which is convenient drinks were good and they have some interesting martini options we enjoyed the complimentary bruschetta and the arancini the saltimbocca was very good but the chicken lemoncello was only good portions are generous the service was very good well above average for delaware county we had a nice time and hope to return soon
5054,i love the fish dishes for the price the food is absolutely delicious and staff have always been friendly
5055,it was decent but hard to find good rolls that aren t fried have cream cheese or imitation crab
5056,this was our first time here at this restaurant we were going to the pacers game and it was located close they also took reservations and that was a bonus because we didn t know how busy it would be on a friday evening with a game we got seated right away 5 45pm and it was not busy at all but just after 6p the place started to get busy our server was really nice and made sure our drinks were always filled it did not take long to get our food either we got the beer cheese tots for our stater and this was really good the bacon pieces were especially delicious my husband had the buffalo chicken burger this is ground chicken with buffalo sauce which i really loved the idea because i was worried it would be more of a fried chicken sandwich he also got the zucchini straws the straws were so so and not something we would order again but the garlic black pepper aioli that comes with the straws was absolutely delicious the burger was just ok it was a bit plain for me and could have used more buffalo sauce there were some toppings missing that were listed on the menu and not a lot of the gorgonzola aioli on the burger i got the stanford which is their turkey burger and again kind of plain again there was hardly any of the tarragon mayo the meat just didn t seem seasoned to be fair we probably could have asked for more aioli and gotten some on the side but i hardly to do that when a restaurant is busy if it s on the menu then it should be on the burger i had the caesar salad as my side which is just your basic side salad overall i wasn t very impressed i would probably go back just for convenience and to try one of the beef burgers but it wouldn t be something i was necessarily looking forward too after this first experience
5057,ask for danny the funniest server ever try the crab claws the sauce is to die for
5058,great service as expected from discount tire locations they are really customer service focused and got 4 new tires within 2 hours of a walk in wasn t cheap but i have a truck and it was a necessity they will try and help you on the price with rebates,awesome wings we had the braised beef tacos chile coconut wings and the pretzels everything was great the beer variety is great too
5059,this crazy tasty cake is amazing and you can get them on all budgets i bought one on my second day dieting for 4 and some change and my remorse went out the window with the first bite fancier but equally delicious cake worked perfectly as a peace offering to my mother in law and im not saying the cake has magical powers but the decorations might because life has been peaceful i loved the seasonal flavors and am slightly worried how close they are to my work that i will be getting a new wardrobe to fit my increasing cake demands just try it seriously low commitment and sky high profits for your tummy
5060,food and service are equally exceptional a wonderful dining experience good prices great menu
5061,so after i posted the review about the receipt goof up they did the manager reached out to apologize and refunded the money i m updating my review to only mention the effort they put in to fix the issue at hand so hoping they have better practices set to avoid future such incidents
5062,the service is awesome staff is very friendly and knowledgeable go check it out tried the deviled eggs devine the fig and goat cheese serrano and margherita flatbreads were delicious as well
5063,ichicoro ane gets lots of things right and the best part about it is the combination of the ambiance with the food choices and whiskey selection i m very happy with this location and the servers i have encountered so far have been helpful and pleasant the katsu is great and i highly recommend it to people looking for a more filling dish on the menu the bao buns were also good for a lighter fish i haven t had anything i really regretted trying but definitely ask your server about the portion sizes of each dish since they vary across the menu the cocktail selection is excellent i even had a special japanese old fashioned last time which was a little expensive but well worth it for some quality japanese whiskey i m looking forward to exploring the menu little by little the best way to experience this is in a group setting so you can try more things and it really reminds me of izakayas or japanese pubs i visited in japan and korea
5064,this place has some good homemade ice cream had the heath bar ice cream and it was delicious other flavors ordered were mint chocolate chip and chocolate both were as good too the line was very long but luckily there were four people taking orders the atmosphere is very appealing found myself looking at the painted murals and finding hidden pictures within them they have a giant chalkboard so that children can draw while parents enjoy a scoop of ice cream definitely a place i would go back to again
5065,my husband and i enjoyed our meals we ordered fried oyster tacos great sauce 4 5 chargrilled oysters 4 5 sauted crab claws 5 5 and red beans and rice 4 5 our server was great he was a younger black guy great recommendations from the food to the drinks
5066,just a regular panera bread but not quite as comfortable as some others i ve been to i love their pasties bagels and their thai salad
5067,great food great atmosphere be sure to make a reservation on a busy night had a splendid experience here in nashville for a convention this for sure added to it
5068,order roti canai chicken satay curry mee price 29 pros hands down the best roti and satay i ve ever eaten cons the food was exceptionally spicy i loved it so not a negative just fair warning thoughts as our final meal for the day we settled on penang mostly due to the amazing reviews for roti which we both love it also got phenomenal reviews for almost everything else apparently we got pretty lucky because when we showed up the restaurant was mostly empty and based on reviews the place can get very busy at times the interior design was very interesting some of the tables were small round steel tables that almost looked like a wok with a metal disk as a lid overall it looked very much like a chinese market and led to a unique overall dcor choice i ve seen it done in a similar way several times but this was the first one that did it effectively once we sat down and got our customary tea we put in our order we were surprised how quickly the food came out we were unsurprised but delighted that both the roti and satay were delicious the roti was thin but not too crunchy and the spicy peanut sauce was just mouth wateringly perfect just the right level of spicy with plenty of flavor the satay was perfect as well crisp exterior with moist interior tons of flavor cooked into the chicken and the perfect sauce to accompany the chicken we both loved the appetizers and would have easily eaten two of three of them once we polished off the appetizers we moved onto the main course once we dug in we confirmed my suspicion that my wife basically just doesn t like traditional chinese food the curry mee was honestly good if exceptionally spicy but neither of us liked it i don t want to talk too much about it because i don t believe it was the quality of the food that caused us to not like it it was just the type of food and i really don t want to knock a place because i don t like their type of food we absolutely loved the roti and satay and i would go out of my way to eat here again i d probably try some other dishes as well and if you already know you like authentic chinese then you should make sure to stop in
5069,i make it my goal to try every taco place in a new city i ve moved to second best taco place in tucson comparable to la tacos which i love these are true street tacos and for a great price easily one of my favorite places to go
5070,this place gets busy it is a tourist destination as it is on the wharf i also went during memorial day weekend so go figure this was the first time that my partner and i ate here and we did not where to go and what to do we were like standing inside until we asked a server how we order and he told us that there was a window on the side of the building if you want to eat inside you might have to wait for a while but if you want to sit outside there are benches on both sides of the restaurants depending on how busy it is you might have to share with other people which is great and fine we ordered a cioppino and i imagined that it was going to be a small serving but when we got it it was huge it fed me and my partner we meant to just get a snack because we were going to go to the public market but i ended up getting really full i did not try anything else so i can t vouch for anything else but this cioppino was amazing as for parking you can park on the wharf which i was amazed at because most wharfs or even piers that i have been to are usually only for pedestrian traffic and parking is free for first 90 minutes that s what i remember don t try to find parking at the very end look for parking as you driving by because my partner and i were able to find parking easily but we saw a lot of people at the end trying to park at the very last parking lot
5071,ok we made a stop here for a nice dinner on our travels home from spring break first of all all of the food was wonderful atmosphere was pretty neat as well our server was very attentive and friendly but not overbearing as a server myself that is important knowing just the right level of interaction desired by a server thumbs up the reason i have rated a 3 out of 5 is because unlike the server food and atmosphere there was a man who seemed to be in the role of a server assistant key hourly he was extremely rude with his looks and demeanor i wish i knew his name because i would make that known but i didn t see a name tag so i def recommend for amazing food and as long as no interaction with this man i m positive your experience will be awesome
5072,my husband and i stumbled upon this place last week and were pleasantly surprised the staff is super cool and helpful and the sandwiches are unreal
5073,this is probably the best restaurant in reno nv we have had a wonderful experience we and my wife had the shrimp and cat fish greens and loaded mashed potatoes and everything was so wonderful please do your self a favor and come here and enjoy the beautiful new orleans vibe and great hospitality i love it here
5074,man this place is busy the kitchen is going nonstop with the servers dishing out the great chinese food known as panda express this one only opened about 2 weeks ago and the word has definitely gotten out to the locals i had the 8 treasure chicken breast and orange chicken with chow mien and fried rice mix the food was great it s a clean ass restaurant like i said the service is great give it a try
5075,we found them on groupon but honestly this was one of the best tours we did on this trip their office are located near armstrong park so you can walk around there if you have some time to kill before or after the tour their office is also shared with a bar so treat yourself to a hurricane or two if you want to just don t bring it into the cemetery later we did the st louis cemetery 1 tour i don t recall what our guide s name was but she was lovely and had a lot of history to share with us it was well paced so it s good for young and old alike
5076,great food and owner is a nice personable young man highly recommend this restaurant
5077,i m so conflicted by this review if you go for drinks i give this place 5 stars the ambiance doesn t get any better the lighting will have you swooning the drinks are great and often they feature a drink that benefits a different organization in the community and then there s the truffle popcorn it s the perfect pairing for a swanky cocktail and it s complimentary then there s the food honestly everything i ve eaten here has been mediocre the devour downtown was especially disappointing the value just wasn t there for a tiny fancy grilled cheese or cheese calzone basically just cheese and bread for 25pp i d skip the food but remember platt 99 for your next date night drink or happy hour
5078,this place is amazing first time i have tried turkish coffee and loved it here the veggie wrap and cheese steak is also great this place gives off great vibes there is an entire cafe section within the restaurant i will definitely make sure to come back to this place if i am in west philly ever again 5 stars

5086,i use them frequently and they normally rate a 5 but do not us the phone app to check out it froze the computer and i had to back out visit the office asked for a manager never got one but the nice guy who did help us out confirmed that the app is unreliable and to this point no one has explained why so just use the phl national car rental but not their phone app
5087,it was my second time eating here the first time was a very long time ago well the food was great and so was the service if nice portions i had the seafood platter was very good
5088,had a great experience with advanced towing recovery i did not have the easiest task for them and we had to work out the details via phone because i am in fl they were very knowledgeable and helpful they went above and beyond to make sure my daughter s vehicle was taken care of
5089,i attended a meeting for the homebuilders association of new orleans here the food was good and they took good care of the patrons i had a mimosa which was good i had a small cup of corn and crab soup which is fantastic but the portion was quite small i had the grits and grillades and it was fantastic the portion same grade on this one the price was around 10 i ve included a photo of the menu for your convenience i didn t get a chance to test the wi fi but i would say given the ambience and the quality of the food it s a repeat
5090,i don t eat raw oysters by my husband does and this was an experience kntrell and frankie were the best oyster shuckers that i ve seen in a very long time i had the new orleans style bbq shrimp and then went onto fruits de mer platter my husband ate the oysters and ate the rest peel and eat shrimp and crab louie we also had the alligator and it was delicious
5091,brunchies is just what we needed in a lutz this is the perfect spot for breakfast or brunch the guava stuffed pancakes are delicious and more than enough to share you can t go wrong with any of the omelettes brunchies also offers a selection of mimosas
5092,this restaurant is in a great location near my apartment and i have ordered from them multiple times the fried egg rolls are delicious by my favorite dish is the shrimp pho the staff are friendly the food is delicious and the atmosphere is nice my only suggestion is to work on a website because the website on the front of the door is no longer in use otherwise this will remain one of my restaurants in rotation
5093,we stopped in and had a couple of drinks and appetizers the craft beers we had were good the old fashioned i had was not what i like in an old fashioned there is always so much variation in this drink but it was ok the cheese board seemed like an afterthought something you just are supposed to have on the menu now in a sports bar but nothing special i ve never had a scoop of blue cheese before the pimiento cheese scoop was good though no explanation from server about what the different cheeses and meats were but i think we guessed pretty well the breads that came with the board were ritz crackers and some kind of hard thin toast that we didn t eat we also ordered duck wings in the appetizer serving size they were fine but the coating was overly sweet to my taste a bit loud but not too bad outdoor seating and half and half bar half inside half outside is nice service was ok we sat at the bar the barmaid insisted on shaking our hands and memorizing our names and while it may have been a genuine attempt at friendship it felt gimmicky to me i ll take superior service any day over handshakes and you knowing my name i wouldn t refuse a second visit but i won t go out of my way to visit again either
5094,i would like the world to know just how great wonderful it is to shop at jcpenneys at the oxford valley mall the store manager chadd whom i had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with what an outstanding person he makes you feel very relaxed and makes good on whatever the problem is and he helps out his staff i was in jewlery and it was busy so he helped his over the top associate carol and helped other customers and went on the register to ring out while she was waiting on me i call this a great store manager outstanding staff and many associates i know and appreciate i so enjoy shopping at jcpenneys but to have a store manager chadd who will listen to whatever you have to say and does not ignore you or have someone else take care of whatever it is he is there to see you and give you the attention you deserve and with that i thank you chadd and carol for all your amazing help

5098,my job orders from them all the time so i knew when my mom came to visit i needed to take her there this was the first hibachi spot my wife and i visited when we came to tampa and it doesn t compare to kobe or the other hibachi food chains
5099,the bird s nest cafe is a neighborhood gem it s a great space to hang out in with plenty of seating the coffee and food options are perfect no matter what time of day it is for breakfast they have select pastries from gracious bakery the bacon croissant and morning bun are my favorites breakfast burritos yummy grits with cheese and bacon and much more for lunch there are many panini sandwiches to choose from a daily soup all good and last but not least the pity pat salad which i love many goodies to choose from and he owners and employees are all very nice and pleasant to be around it s a great place to meet and catch up with friends and neighbors
5100,10hr fishing trip this particular offshore trip was a bargain buy where a 10 hour trip was offered at half price which was great the duration was from 7am 5pm the crew was awesome and very helpful at the time of my trip they could not offer live bait because they ran into a situation that was beyond their control and they lost all their live bait all of the fish i caught grunts porgies short red grouper were things i ve caught from the skyway bridge or close to shore conclusion look for the bargain trips bring cash to tip the crew they work very hard and go the extra mile to serve the guests don t set huge expectations to catch really big fish but expect to catch lots of fish check out some of the other trips they offer from what i understand those trips are geared more toward bigger fish and more variety
5101,security guard told me he would put me in jail for 24 hours if i went in the pool told him i was gonna 1 5 him on yelp here ya go dude in the white shirt why have a pool it u can t swim but everyone else was super cool and nice good music cool place but security guard sucked
5102,giordano s has pretty good pizza and the restaurant is nice overall i ve eaten in once and had delivery once the pizza was better in the restaurant the cheese pizza is heavy but i thought it was good not amazing as my chicago friends insisted it would be but enjoyable it s not among my go to pizza places downtown but it s not a bad option
5103,i live in the san gabriel valley and visit sb frequently and i always make it a point to go to chase for lunch or dinner or just cocktails i ve been going to chase b g for at least 20 years have always had superb service and tried different entrees and have never been disappointed i have gone there for thanksgiving dinner as well and the menu is excellent when the devastating fires and mudslides occurred this past year chase emailed their customers a comforting invitation about providing service to their loyal customers and new customers i will be visiting sb in august and september and plan to have dinner at chase while i m there i definitely give chase 5 stars
5104,absolutely amazing service they were so helpful with the menu and more than patient with us as we were catching up with friends and couldn t decide what to get the food was amazing and the drinks are delicious can t wait to go back
5105,i get the annual pass every year love to bring visitors to the park i live close enough to hike here often

5107,excellent food fresh local ingredients extremely flavorful and delicious also very efficient with to go orders they always check the receipt to make sure everything is in the bag that was ordered which is also greatly appreciated and lastly i enjoyed reading the words from ron that i picked up as i was leaving about happiness and being happy such a small personal touch that makes ron s so wonderful
5108,first timers here but was not disappointed had to wait 20 30 minutes for a spot for two at the counter but it flew by staff very friendly and happy great smells and things to watch and entertain you as the time goes by my wife and i split the short rib hash perfect quantity for two the eggs were done perfectly runny to mix in with the tators and the onions and ribs very hot so watch those first couple bites wife enjoyed a glass of fresh squeezed oj amazing and i had a cup of coffee that never saw empty thanks to an attentive waitress all in all a great breakfast experience we will be back
5109,during my first visit to new orleans i visited lke for their 75 cent oyster happy hour and a french 75 which is a cocktail made from gin champagne lemon juice and sugar the oysters were delicious but the french 75 was exceptional the crowd wasn t as stuffy as you would expect for an upscale restaurant and since i was alone a local and large family invited me to sit and celebrate with them a few days later i impressively visited lke blacked out after a couple of hurricanes and ordered 75 00 worth of burgers and fries that were still decent the next day moral of these stories dine at lke and take any leftovers except for oysters in a doggy bag
5110,we called sierra air on february 24th saturday for them to check our thermostat to furnace was not working sierra air came within the hour and cleaned the furnace sensors and all was well we bought our home a couple years ago and this was the first time we had the furnace serviced now we know to have it serviced annually especially for all the safety sensors the serviceman was very polite and answered all our questions thank you sierra air
5111,i ordered ice cream and decided to ask about veggie burgers they have them i order one of those as well i joined their club online and got a free scoop i chose their flavor of the day caramel cashew the burger was flavorful and the ice cream had real pieces of cashews in it which was a nice surprise it was very creamy ice cream the lady that helped me was very nice and knowledgeable and i think i would revisit this place and try some of their other ice cream options
5112,here enjoying a great burger the mad love until a random customer start complaining about things that didn t happen the manager didn t listen to her bar staff or me while defending them she ended up giving away a gift card to this guy he lies and makes up things about the staff and he rewards him wow the bartender and hostess were amazing and helped me out every moment of my time spent here except while the manager was distracting them to cater to the loud mouths lies i will definitely come back and spend time here michelle was off duty and still helped me out
5113,delicious food very attentive staff reasonable cost and huge portion size are why i give this place 5 loved every minute and came away stuffed my meal curry goat with rice beans and attekie drink ginger beer juice wife s meal grilled lamb with rice beans and fried plantains drink byssop
5114,we went to lil dizzys cafe as it was very close to our airbnb in treme was also recommended to us by our uber driver we went in for an early breakfast at 8 30 am we got the eggs grits smoked sausage the andouille sausage gumbo and two biscuits the eggs grits smoked sausage were nothing special tasted good but not great fairly standard the gumbo tasted quite good would definitely recommend this if you re looking to try a quick no nonsense nola gumbo biscuits were also very tasty overall good place for a quick breakfast
5115,i can t wait to go back it s unbelievably full of everything anything you could possibly want from an italian market you can eat there as well unfortunately it closes very early on saturday but we didn t know were lucky to get inside before they locked it a lot of items were already in the process of being put away so we didn t buy very much couldn t even get bread or eat there i was starving so i grabbed some cheese ate some of course saved the package to pay for it need a lot of time to meander around there s so much variety it s sensory overload what we did buy was delicious
5116,love this location great customer service and fresh food love being able to find new items to try and appreciate the sample and ideas provided each time i visit tight parking but worth it
5117,great little hole in the wall right next to the party area one of the best burgers i ve had nice juicy good tasting burger fries are off the charts service was quick staff was awesome recommend this place for anybody that looking for a quick lunch going to try philly cheesesteak next time
5118,this is great place for mani pedi you really feel like family when you go in relax with a glass of wine spa music and great technicians the owner mila remember your name and visits all the guests
5119,maybe my favorite location to visit at least once a week especially when on this side of town their selection is random but unlike most other locations this one usually have items in my size especially shoes and sometimes hats but most of all its all about the selections that draw me here so i suggest you make a stop if you have the time one thing i learned about shopping at ross if you see something you like buy it don t wait because it may not be there next time
5120,this food truck is a real hawaiian grill unlike other local restaurants that are 0 hawaiian with similar names i made sure i got my work done early so i d have the extra time to drive from work to the bjc location and it was worth it i got the loco moco a poke bowl platter spam musubi and a lumpia roll it was competing against my memory the hawaiian grills from my home town of las vegas and it did not disappoint one bit i honestly think it was all the best i have had i plan to go there every week and i hope that one day it becomes a full fledged restaurant it s my mission to try everything on the menu side note next time i try kimchi fried rice which most of the korean places i have been to don t even have buzz s has a very complementary mix of cuisines
5121,beware of parking this place is good and healthy now that i can walk here i don t have to drive across town to get my taziki s fix this location is always clean and i have never had an issue finding a table the only issue is that i keep running into people i know and getting into really long conversations
5122,the staff spent over 10 minutes on the phone with me answering all of my ridiculous questions about my serious dietary needs what they have to offer two thumbs up for the patience and kindness they offered me
5123,the hotel is in a great location in the city easy walk to broadway and first street the hotel staff at the front desk are very personable and helpful especially the night time crew there is often live music and a pool and bar on the 5th floor gym has great equipment to get a workout in i would stay here again
5124,surprisingly good had the grouper fish fry on a friday night which was unlimited fish it was good husband had buffalo chicken sandwich which he liked kids at free as we were staying at hotel ate there for breakfast which omelet was simple but was really good as well
5125,oh man are the burgers here tasty indy always has room for more burger options and this place has instantly become a major competitor the location is fantastic the restaurant has a nice look and feel to it and the food just does not disappoint fork the extra money over for the doctorate just do it you will not regret it
5126,first restaurant i went to post baby so i was super excited to get out and enjoy a great meal surely enough workshop delivered great atmosphere and good service the deep fried risotto balls are a must
5127,let me start this by saying that i arrived at the restaurant soaking wet from a rainstorm so i hope this won t color my review however the food here was not up to the level of other meals i have had this week in new orleans the drinks were good on the expensive side they gave complimentary souvenir cups clean matching the type our drinks were served in i had an oyster po boy the oysters were medium sized and still greasy from frying the oysters were topped with slaw which was delicious the poor boy came with fries i am on a low salt diet and they tasted very salty to me my daughter did not find them unusually salty we were in the back room but we could still hear the jazz from the stage room in general this is a decent place to eat bar food and listen to music
5128,my first time to cameo was the friday before easter i had read the reviews and chose melissa to do my hair i was very pleased at the beautiful salon the cleanliness of the salon and how friendly everyone was melissa was great and color came out great i called yesterday may 8th and was told she could do may 9 ay 5 pm i thought that was rather quick because melissa is always booked someone had over booked her
5129,i was skeptical to buy polish pierogis at an italian market but i m happy i did comparable to the polish market we buy fresh pierogis in detroit they were very flavorful tasty and fresh i will be going back for more and to try more stuff
5130,the best happy hour oyster place i have ever 2 dozen raw oyster and crab plus brussels sprouts a meal we will remember for a long time we will be back
5131,this place is amazing i have been here twice now once with my boyfriend for a date night the atmosphere was perfect staff was very friendly and though our table was right beside the dishwasher we did get a couple little splashes in which we laughed off it was an amazing time second time i took my mother for a mother daughter lunch bother times we did the feed me option both times got the bacon that dang dish is amazing dreams are made from that dish my mother daughter day was just as enjoyable i recommend this place to everyone i love the food is so fresh and typically locally sourced you can taste the quality care and pride that is served to you on your plate a little on the pricey side but that is why it is a treat for us to go and the price is totally worth it try it and tell me i am wrong
5132,it was delicious a great location and i loved the atmosphere also both the host and server were very nice
5133,this is one of my favorite stops in reno for the coffee the food and the atmosphere as well great coffees pastries breakfast items and more a nice wine selection and both inside and outside it seems coffeebar is always full my go to drink is their chocolate cappuccino i use this as a remote work location where i can enjoy the coffee while working yes it can get noisy but a quiet workspace drives me nuts
5134,this location provides a steady stream of small and sundry items i need to fix up my house and to build fun things with and for my children staff is solid and reasonable with an uncanny knack for knowing where things are hidden by the time i m done fixing everything at my new location i suspect my house will be approximately 11 from this home depot
5135,hidden gem this was a great surprise for me to find and even a better place to dine in the servers and the chef are great and have a great pulse on what british cuisine should be definetley worth a visit i will be returning very soon
5136,we stopped by in the afternoon on a weekday there were perhaps only half a dozen other people in the building we just stopped in for a quick flight the decor and ambiance were fun we tried the basil ryeman which was really interesting only try this one if you like basil as the basil flavor is very strong we liked it though we also tried the farmer s beat which was reddish in color from the beet root it had the beet flavor but it was subtle not very in your face we had the country roots sweet potato stout which was my favorite i think it s kinda hard to find a unique stout in this day and age the sweet potato gave it a sweet slightly earthy flavor we also had the wildwood flower honey blonde it was good you could definitely taste the honey the staff was nice we enjoyed the visit
5137,i recently moved into a new home and key one helped get nearly 15 locks rekeyed in no time very reasonable prices and the owner was understanding of my time constraints because i was on my lunch break he changed everything out and i was on my way back to work thank you for a job well done
5138,hi im mona y tonight was my first time going here based on a a lot of reviews first let say being in the public everyday and dealing with the public people are mean rude and lazy but not these ladies oh my goodness they are wonderful as soon as you hit the door i would come back just on customer service alone now the food its good i took it to go i m a professional foodie and critic its good im sorry i dont care for the sauces for me its an acquired taste i also suggest they not serve them hot to go the plastic containers they put open that gives it the opportunity to spoil they over heat so i suggest have some to the side just for to go order that cool just a side thought but its ok i know how to fix it i had a wonderful experience thank you guys
5139,we visited them on a saturday night and were seated right away it has an old school family restaurant vibe our server was attentive and helpful and brought us our drinks right away since this was our first time we decided to just get a feel for their menu we ordered crawfish pies crab balls fries a dozen of charbroiled oysters i was more impressed with the fries than anything else however my wife loved the crab balls the oysters lacked that grill garlic flavor and had quite a bit of trash inside of them i actually chomped down on one that went straight to my gums ouch needless to say we won t order their oysters anymore if we decide to go back
5140,i loved the ambiance the service is just phenomenal we received so much food i actually have grocery leaving lol the food taste just like love you can just tell the food is cooked from the heart and soul glad we decided to try this soul food restaurant reminds me of being in the south
5141,love this new italian market restaurant the waiters were as nice and helpful as can be the food was phenomenal do not miss the short rib pasta we had probably 6 or 7 dishes plus dessert and the only thing that wasn t basically perfect was the duck with cauliflower rice the cauliflower rice was quite salty but other than that overall flavor of it was also great i would order everything we got again including the delicious desserts and can t wait to try the rest of the menu
5142,i love this place the cupcakes are sooooooo moist and delicious i always get david and goliath i would ve given it 5 stars but 3 50 for a cupcake is ludicrous i only go for special occasions
5143,first time trying this place and loved it service was fast and friendly got the pulled pork smoked turkey breast mac and cheese and baked potato casserole and everything was hot fresh and full of flavor also tried the chicken and cheese and brisket and cheese tacos which were very filling and delicious will be coming back and often
5144,excellent breakfast spot it is literally around the corner from our house i will be back jacky breakfast sandwich was my choice for this day my dad had b e and he liked it i want to try the burger next time btw breakfast is not the most important meal of the day that s a myth,wow wow we ve been trying to go here for a while and for some reason or another it hasn t happened we used our access card and walked there last night and i must say this is one of the best meals i ve had in awhile for italian food the best i ve had forever which is a long time we will be coming back deep fried ravioli appetizer we had chicken alfredo and eggplant parmesan for entrees she ordered a glass of wine that was 10 that we did realize we could buy the bottle for 11 later which is fine i understand when we come back we will be served by mario because he is the best
5145,we have and do like this place the pool is dirty we use this koa as a few day stop over in our travels hit the town etc first time this beautiful was used by us as the weather has allowed it and really can t buy a pool cleaner for at night to clean leaves sand and dirt out cement deck is covered by dead leaves koa man walks around looking at women like a rooster lol internet is weak and a battle to use strange as they have really did up the place and it s that or this way must be weak management paid almost 70 for a back in
5146,meaning of the only problem here is that their french fries are soggy and undercooked
5147,got to enjoy their falafel wrap for the second time delicious falafel sharing space with an amazing amount of crispy veggies all enhanced with a creamy sauce and bundled with a flour wrap yummy and filling staff was so friendly and they worked hard to get the orders out quickly thanks all wrapped up for coming to black rock bikes and helping to make the tuesday night ride group summer solstice celebration such a highlight of the summer
5148,best cuban sandwich that i ever had i love this place good prices and great quality food
5149,great restaurant and creative menu we also love la mulita next door which shares the same kitchen the only downside is that they do not take reservations so it can be a bit of a gamble on a weekend you also need your whole party to sit so if you have a late friend you could be stuck for a bit
5150,tennessee roll that s it so yum there is a sweet old lady who is very good sometimes but not so much others she likes to talk i always get a small fried rice and a tennessee roll which is enough for dinner
5151,i believe they have new management now the produce section has vastly improved no more gnats flying around rotting fruit and better dates on dairy eggs etc the store seems much cleaner now you can actually get to the milk refrigerator case there is no longer a table of products placed in the way that you have to trip over the bakery section is surprisingly good i ve purchased a few cakes here and all have been fresh and delicious the employees behind the bake section counter are very nice and helpful thanks for not blasting bubble gum music over the speakers great job
5152,this place was extremely good definitely one of the best ramen places i ve been to there was plenty of food and the rice beer was good there was a line but it moved quickly and they let you look at the menu while in line so the service was quick they should look into getting hot sake for sale bombs though
5153,i have been to this location twice now once in the summer and once in december i love this place not only for it s diversity in atmosphere between the bar and dining room but for it s excellent customer service and great food the server was knowledgeable about the specials and answered all questions with ease she made recommendations based on our questions about the menu and alternatives to try the drinks were made with precision which enhanced the experience especially since we were entertaining guests from out of town with particular standards for manhattans they commented that it was the best they ve had the restrooms are clean and easily accessible i love that they have live music this rounds out the experience the only issue was the music in the bar was a little too loud which made it difficult to have casual conversation in the dining room overall a great experience and we will go back
5154,six stars for the handsomizer my only complaint is that i wish my hair would grow faster so i could go more often there s always a football soccer match playing solid tunes in the background and a beverage offered it feels like conversations pick up right where we left off on my last visit if you re a nashville native and looking for a new barber i cannot recommend the handsomizer enough you ll get compliments everywhere you go and will be counting the days until your hair grows back and you can visit again
5155,everything here was great including the coffee the chicken and waffles were fantastic and our server kyle at the bar was super nice even though it was incredibly busy
5156,this is the best cleanest and most efficient bk in the area john
5157,ashton what a great margarita i was not expecting this type of high class well made margarita mike the manager is absolutely the only
5158,writing this review after my third time dining at compere it is consistently good every time with some highlights and some misses though throughout the meal ambiance is decent service is fine and attentive we tried all small bite items on the menu currently the conch and the arancini were really great first course wise hamachi was well prepared with good flavor and the whippe ricotta was one of the best dishes on the menu the biggest let down of the evening was the black drum it was unbearably bland with the accompanying sauce broth not adding much at all main course wise should stick with the goat which is always excellent banana chocolate fritters for dessert were tasty all in all good meal but they need some serious work on their fish dishes
5159,we went to the c house about a week after they officially opened the environment is great and the location is nice too the menu was limited because they were still trying to get everything put together which is very understandable but from what everyone had there was no complaints about the food the buffalo cauliflower app was awesome along with the dipping sauce the mac and cheese took a little longer than expected but it was absolutely delicious the asian slaw salad was incredible as while along with the cauliflower dipping sauce that a few of us actually used for the salad they should keep that has there salad side dressing all in all we will definitely be back and the c concept is so great and unique love it definitely recommend if you re in the tampa area
5160,i loved this place it was my first time coming here with my friend and we both loved the service and how our manicures came out they made us feel welcome and taken care of i really enjoyed it and we will definitely come back we did make an appointment at around 1pm on a saturday and there was only one other customer in there with us
5161,sooooo good fav spot downtown classy intimate and more quiet than most dining places drinks are phenomenal i recommend the margarita they have a great dining room tons of booths also they do rooftop dining enjoy your experience here
5162,wow what i nice little find and within walking distance of the home 2 suite hotel has a small beer selection but a very stocked and large walk in humidor service was great even though the place was a little packed from the ncaa march madness tournament but it was easy in and easy out can t wait to go back and see what else they have when we are back in town
5163,the service and the drink was good but that is where it ends i ordered the falafel plate it came with a teaspoon of hummus 3 falafels pita some roasted veggies and some nasty grain i tried to make the most of it and asked from some more hummus i was given another teaspoon not tablespoon so my falafels were dry it was a 17 dollar horrible meal i left unsatisfied so we went to another place so i could actually eat good drinks but don t get the falafels unless you hate hummus
5164,i had the entrecte grille et frites picture included and my wife had the boudin stuffed porkchop both meals were amazing in addition we walked in on a friday at 5pm with no reservation and were seated immediately the only negative comment is the that the wait staff seemed stretched a little thin we got our drink orders and it was probably 10 15mins before they came back to see if we were ready to order i even noticed the couple next to us also trying to get the wait staffs attention so they could pay their bill overall it was a great experience and we plan to come back in the near future
5165,i came here spur of the moment on my way to another shop after reading about it a while back i had a wonderfully tasty brownie it had a moist texture and was flavorful the employee that helped me was friendly and kind and i ll definitely be back to try other items
5166,very nice stay modern high ceilings clean comfortable room and bed walking distance to broadway and the ryman auditorium very nice accommodating staff wish we could stay longer mile end cafe in the hotel had delicious bagels
5167,writing this review before i ve finished it is that good here on business with a colleague and we ordered the honey nut sweet potato fried the crawfish spring rolls the shrimp fgt remoulade po boy and the chicken waffles all of it was absolutely incredible can not recommend this place enough the staff and the food is amazing
5168,this was my first time in nola and i was looking for brunch spot i got to katie and the was an hour wait my friend and i decided to wait it out and we were glad that we did we got the bottomless mimosas and sangrias while we waited for our food my glass was never empty our server was very attentive to making sure we had enough drinks the portions were huge i got the crab cake p o boy and it was so tasty definitely recommend checking them out for brunch
5169,best chicken you could ever hope for in bourbon st the chicken is good the sauce is good everything is goof
5170,probably should be a 4 5 the food was amazing pork roll fries are definitely a must but you gotta try the meatballs as well they were juicy and melted in your mouth and the crab cake sandwich was delicious as well all in all good prices for what you get a lot of places charge a lot more for smaller portions and lesser quality food service was a little on the slow side but it was packed on a saturday night so you have to take that into consideration i just moved to the area so i ll be back many more times
5171,bre is an outstanding guide we booked their the infamous city of the dead cemetery tour had a blast it is a 2 hour tour not only did we get to tour the cemetery but bre gave us the 411 on the history of nola slavery architecture what voodoo truly is not what is portrayed in the media hurricane katrina music lively culture that is new orleans more it was great learning all of this from bre because she is a native we got to learn about the traditions she was brought up with make sure to wear sunscreen sun gear etc because even though it was just warm the sun beats down on you in addition it is like 100 degrees in the cemetery so bring water in case you forget there is a friendly man that sells water for cheaper outside,new orleans most powerful drink the hand grenade there are 5 locations solely on bourbon street which means 5 opportunities to get trashed hand grenade keep the grenade because you can get refills for cheaper so what does this bad boy taste like it tastes like melon it does not even taste like it has much alcohol in it but whoa it is a secret hangover waiting to happen
5172,great place for a quick and easy meal all of the staff are very friendly they seem to make a lot of their items from scratch chili dog was great and the hand breaded chicken tenders were very good
5173,i ve read through some of the reviews and i can absolutely see how that the different situations could ve been the case i just went for restaurant week with a few of my girlfriends the good things i was warmly greeted by the hostess when i came in she checked me in because we had a reservation and i went to the bar to have a drink while i waited for them the bartender was very nice as soon as the rest of my party arrived we were seated our waitress was very nice given that it was a bit crazy in there with restaurant week she was accommodating and went above and beyond when one of the appetizers was not good the one busser kept our table clean and made sure we had what we needed and the hostess even checked on us too and the bathroom was very clean this is what earned my stars the okay things the bar area seemed a little dark and dusty almost like they just don t pay attention to that area my food was okay but i feel that i would need to try again on a non restaurant week to see how things compare i felt the dinner portions were small but then we got a huge but delicious piece of cake for dessert the filet was cooked as ordered and the crab cake didn t taste like it was all filling but the crab cake was small the only side available was a baked potato it would ve been nice to have a vegetable option too i d try again i hope the service is just as good as it was tonight even if it was an act
5174,great breakfast would definitely come again highly recommend next to carrollton market had the southern breakfast basic but excellent nothing pretentious just good
5175,this could be one of the best gems of south city thank god we only live within a 5 min walk the owner dianna is amazing and the wine and food are sure to satisfy
5176,i love the setup nice the floors and furniture earthtones very relaxing and aesthetically pleasing the place is packed with millennials and that s totally fine because sometimes you get tired of looking in the face of baby boomers the mojito was really good it was beautiful tasty and sexy yum appetizers tried the 3 salsas not gonna rave about those the tomatillo fell flat and had the consistency of runny snot the pumpkin salsa was different and you gotta love pumpkin seeds thank goodness i do lol i believe the pumpkin salsa will be an acquired taste for some now that guacamole was off the chain good you can taste the freshness i i completely enjoyed that pop of serrano the queso fundido is a salted hell entre i did the fish tacos the pickled onions weren t my favorite thing on the taco out of the 3 tacos the aioli wasn t consistently distributed one had too much and on the other one it was barely there the pickled onions tasted more like salt i don t believe they did anything for the tacos i personally feel the taco slaw and pickled onions needs work the herb rice is beautiful to look at it s green love that but it was flavorless flat and bland good thing because the black beans were off the charts with salt i get the salt and pepper thing when cooking but too much ruins a good thing dinner was okay needs a little tweaking before i d say fabulous i d dine here again for the empanadas i m curious about how they taste the flavors here can only be interpreted by a discerning matured pallet to truly understand and appreciate,first time in here did a all day long shopping spree with a friend and i enjoyed my time spent in this store it s small but easy to maneuver around
5177,we had such a great tour with david he was so much fun welcoming and had so much good information about new orleans the food and the people we are now locals and know that we need to ask for our burgers dressed food was good and david obviously has good relationships with all of the stops on the way
5178,un maravilloso hotel tiene muchas comodidades un buen personal las piscinas son limpias el paisaje la comida todo muy rico tiene un buen olor
5179,this restaurant was on my list of recommendations from a friend and the food was excellent my entree was the steak au poivre perfectly med rare with a delicious sauce fried goat cheese as an appetizer our server jeremy was courteous and friendly must add though if on a busy night be prepared to wait as they do not take reservations and have limited seating
5180,went to two different party s this week at ole reds first upstairs private party the food very good service was even better everyone had a great time second party even bigger our hosts rented the whole restaurant for a private party again the food was fabulous service was perfect the problem was a more personal issue there was a group of us from bakersfield enjoying the food and service while listening to the band who were taking requests so i got up with a 20 00 dollar bill in hand and made a request for anything from merle haggard returned to our table and waited and waited it became clear the leader of the band preferred more current song choices not old forgotten country music legends being from bakersfield it would have meant a lot to us the band was good but lack of respect to take a tip and dishonor country legend all in the same night is shameful one song any song
5181,our tacos were delicious we will definitely come back the building itself was a little lacking a bit of a dive set back in a strip mall the prices were great so was the service for a taco shop they are on point thanks guys
5182,first time here yesterday had the doner sandwich which was delicious the spicy original tzatziki sauce on the sandwich was a wonderful addition my meal mate had the goulash suppe and said it was very good the beer list is extensive and i couldn t resist a half liter hofbrau hefe a great accompaniment to that sandwich service was fast efficient and very friendly this restaurant is a great addition to the southern end of st petersburg
5183,we had a nice time here great place for a group the restaurant handled a large group of 18 for us and i greatly appreciated the manager and our server who was very attentive there was one server at a busy place so it wasn t as fast as if we were a smaller but more than acceptable given our group size also the price point is very reasonable for nola we were upstairs and the room is spacious and a little loud with all of us talking for those who didn t like seafood there was selection for them i had a sampler and i found that i would have skipped and ordered the etouffe as it is the best food in the sampler my husband ordered the creole house po boy which had a nice spicy messy sauce but i missed the crunch of the fried shrimp
5184,i stayed here for two nights recently for a friend s wedding and was largely impressed the rooms are spacious and have good views the lobby bar is nice and the food is good i thought my room was well priced at 139 night but that is below the normal price since we were part of a wedding guest block the hotel staff were also very nice without being over the top i only have two minor criticisms and i d still recommend this hotel overall first the breakfast buffet is ridiculously expensive 16 dollars for continental and a whole 35 dollars if you want anything hot the food was good but not 35 bucks for breakfast good walk to city tap house for brunch instead the other criticism is an unfortunate circumstance rather than anything the hotel is doing wrong but it still affects the experience the street block the hotel is on does not smell good something was up with the sewer or something hopefully it s not always like that fortunately our room was on the twentieth floor and the street level smell was not an issue there
5185,this is the closest vietnamese restaurant around my area pho is great for the price the rice dishes are also great i love there thai tea very tasty and sweet
5186,it was delicious going back today the chicken is rhe best the frozen daiquiri was delicious
5187,i have mixed feelings about this place i like the vibe but it always seems to disappoint the service is friendly but not fast after i sat at the bar several bartenders saw me and continued to interact among themselves i was about to leave when i was given a menu so i ordered a beer and then some brunch it should not take 20 minutes to get a frittata but when it arrived it was hot so i put the delay down to the place being busy it happens being steaming hot however was part of the problem it was the asparagus frittata with salad but the salad was served on top rendering it soggy from the steam from the eggs it was sort of like when you order a takeout burger and fries and they put the fries in a styrofoam container with the hot meat limp worse there was no point in putting the salad on top as it added no flavor and the frittata was so underseasoned eggs with no salt or pepper that it just added to the overall blandness it was however generously sized and the eggs were properly cooked not rubbery at all after removing the flaccid greens and salting and peppering it it was pretty good are disastrous ideas like this a product of the cooking show culture where everyone is trying to make dishes creative without regard to conception or execution in any case the beers are well selected and drawn and there are ample seats at the bar which is appreciated when dining single i have eaten here twice but next time i ll just have an excellent and well priced beer and enjoy the atmosphere
5188,atmosphere interesting crowd very young and trendy likely very privaledged people and that are local or college students not diverse at all most seem to be beach style trendy but rough like you just got out of bed but your look is premeditated comfortable seating area very busy which is probably great for business pretty sure i saw a dude with beach clothes on and a gold chain also saw some women in emo style but they appeared to be privaledged as well obviously not certain of any of this but i want to paint you an accurate picture food pretty good and likely considered healthy i can never really tell lots of acai and other styles of bowls to include oatmeal and quinoa i got the quinoa bowl and my wife tried the muesli bowl the food was pretty good service nothing special good service overall probably worth going back based on the healthy option route not bad
5189,ekta proved to b a successful date night spot quiet place with a handful of customers on an average wednesday it was a byob but we didn t partake i ordered a soda and was disappointed when i paid 2 bucks for a can of soda i could see the soda fountain behind the hostess desk feels like a bait and switch but now i know for next time we ordered garlic naan chicken kabob and veggie samosas for an appetizer before our food came out samosas were hot and fresh without being overly greasy the kabob was a flavor bomb perfectly cooked with just the right amount of char on the marinated chicken will be ordering that again i ordered the chicken vindaloo my go to indian dish and the wife ordered lamb tikka masala both dishes came out steaming along with a plate of rice to share i always get the vindaloo extra spicy and it did not disappoint great level of heat made me sweat a bit but did not compromise flavor at one point i coughed and the hostess giggled because she was worried they made it too hot for me but i assured it everything was great garlic naan was soft and pillowy and perfect for wiping up the last bits of the red sauce on my plate portions were good but i could have used a bit more jasmine rice will be returning
5190,i lived in camden bay apartments when they were brand new i would recommend it i rate it 2 on my list from a scale of 1 10 me and my daughter loved it
5191,excellent food and service great korean food try the kfc and poke sushi and the pad thai is also on point to those who complain about the long waits friday s and saturday s are generally busy at places that are popular and serve quality eats maybe take up meditation or just practice some good old fashioned patience anyways give this place a try it s not easy to find quality asian cuisine in tn and this is a great spot with quality food
5192,what a great restaurant outstanding service food was awesome particularly the grits pancakes and hash browns be sure to add onions and cheese what a great experience
5193,i came here with my girlfriends and let me tell you it gets packed fast we ate oysters for breakfast and it was so worth it the server that we had memorized all 6 of our complicated customized orders i was very impressed oysters here taste like the fresh ocean i ordered the oyster po boy and that deliciousness came out fast i definitely recommend this place when visiting nola
5194,my mother and i were walk ins for a pedicure we were welcomed very warmly certainly a great experience
5195,omg i got some food delivered and it was so good here is what i got vietnamese tacos i ve never had this before delicious taco shell white doughy and sweet grilled summer rolls clear sticky and crammed with those white noodles and veggies loved it chinese egg rolls the best egg rolls i ve ever had i could only eat half of everything except i ate both egg rolls
5196,there s not very many places for lumpia in reno but i found this little place i can t comment on the rest of the food available but the lumpia was exactly what i was looking for i ordered directly through the yelp app it was confirmed and ready for pick up exactly as expected very happy easy to access location with plenty of parking in a quiet shopping center
5197,i am in love with this place a charmingly friendly and helpful staff incredibly diverse excellent spread for breakfast chocolate covered strawberries as a treat in the room great location across from redding terminal great happy hour in the hotel bar
5198,great local diner had the corned beef hash and eggs made perfectly with fast friendly service will be hitting this place often open 24 hrs
5199,if you want caring superior customer service and great quality work green hills seamstress is the place to go i took my wedding dress last tuesday for an estimate on a few adjustments their prices were significantly lower than others i had been quoted and they called me wednesday just a week after i had dropped it off saying it was ready for me to come try it on it was perfect i was scared my dress wouldn t fit for my big day or that i d spend an arm and a leg to get it altered but they made all worries fade away while i was there i noticed the crocheted loop in the back was missing they added a metal hoop and reenforced all the snaps and hooks in the back of the dress while i waited and didn t charge me anything i m very impressed i ll be back for anything else i need
5200,dr sarah burns has been my daughter s doctor since birth she s three now dr burns is awesome caring gentle calm thorough we love her our only complaint has been with one nurse who was very impatient with us and our inability to hold down our struggling 18 month old for a shot our daughter was then too upset for dr burns to properly examine her since then i ve requested shots be given after the exam and we ve not seen that nurse again so who knows it is a big combined practice so there are the typical pitfalls in the auxiliary staff not knowing you but they all have treated us well even if they didn t i d put up with it to keep dr burns as our doctor she s worth it
5201,love the building itself and all the fab art on the walls one of the things that makes eagle unique very fun place to grab coffee with a friend i pass on the food though because its really not great
5202,the whole reason we drive out of the way and come to this twistee treat is because they have no sugar added sugar free ice cream that is extremely hard to find but today the machine was broken trip wasted my not seem like a big deal to most people but when sugar is an issue these places stand apart but like i said not today
5203,wow we had the pleasure of one of the best dinning experiences in a very long time i travel a lot and eat out 80 of the time so i am exposed to many types of dinning scenarios we sat at the upper bar and had drinks and dinner let s start with the staff incredible we interacted with two bar tenders and a few other staff all were extremely knowledgeable and passionate about their role in the org you can tell that the owners treat and train everyone at a high level let s get to the food and drink we had the brussels sprouts and yuca fries to start both outstanding then we ordered the paella cauliflower and canelones everything was fresh with unique flavor the pickled fresno peppers were so good the staff gave me a tub to take home and because we asked so many questions we were given a tour of the kitchen to meet the chief that s a first the beer and drinks were on par with the food i have zero negatives and will be back
5204,lascelles is another restaurant located within walking distance of the cinema in downtown granite city the restaurant is inside an old bank building directly across from city hall the tomato bisque is outstanding it comes with two small pieces of a grilled cheese sandwich i order this ever time i go to this restaurant lascelles has a great special it consists of a 16 oz steak a 16 oz baked potato and a 16 oz beer for 16 the dress code for this restaurant is casual and you can normally get a table without a wait i would recommend this restaurant
5205,amazing falafel salad the sandwich is decent and i haven t tried their drinks but the salad is by far and away one of my favorite dishes in philly franklin food court is usually pretty busy so i would recommend coming outside of peak lunch hours like 11 am
5206,great place to eat for lunch dinner is the same menu but cost more hibachi was great and entertaining staff very friendly and attentive
5207,so surprised by the quality this food was delicious and so fresh not bad of a wait time either for delivery so pleased
5208,seriously what s not to love about this place super relaxed atmosphere friendly staff cool decor awesome food and ice cream martinis which you can t find anywhere else hidden gem
5209,best mexican food in st charles
5210,amazing meal appetizers were delicious all the steaks including the filet carne asada were flavorful and tender all the sides are family size so sharing is a must topped it off with the sampler board for dessert an assortment of all the desserts on a mini board definitely recommend
5211,wow we came here to end our family vacation knowing it was going to be pricey i d urge everyone to look into the costs up front so you don t have any surprises on check out we checked in on a sunday afternoon and it was really quick the rep was knowledgeable and friendly and gave instructions on how to find our room the room was the cheapest they had but still really nice and very clean we dropped our stuff off and explored there is so much to see and so much to do some of the activies are free like the fountain show in the evenings but most aren t such as the riverboat ride or the spa services dinner our first night was at the cantina prices are decent and the service was good our second night we ate at piaso pizza the pizza was good for the price generous servings for 4 friendly service and a decent selection of wines there are at least three coffee houses that i counted and all serve starbucks coffee there are three pools one indoor and two outdoor the cascades outdoor pool has already 1 5 small pool that was perfect for our three year old and the larger pool went up to 4 6 which was great for our 8 year old there is a great locker room by the cascades indoor pool that has showers a hair dryer and restrooms overall my family and i had a great time and i don t regret the money we spent for the two nights we were here which was a lot just do your research and take the time to see the scenery it is breathtaking
5212,thank you so much rolling hills pet clinic walked in today with no appointment pretty concerned that my cat was feeling sick all weekend i was able to get a appointment staff was very friendly as soon as i walked in greeted me and my cat with a smile and treated me as if i had been going there for years i truly felt like they were concerned about my pet the doctor dr deutsch really took the time to explain all my questions and did not seem rushed overall the doctor was very knowledgeable and gave off a very positive vibe very good reasonable pricing i definitely will recommend them to my family and friends once again thank you again to all the staff there you guys are great your kindness is very much appreciated fiona also says thank you
5213,cute place and the dragon tea i got with sea salt foam was pretty good not too sweet and i was afraid the sea salt foam would be too salty but was just fine very thick foam and is a little too much but very tasty with crispy jelly added this place is on the higher end of prices imo for just a boba milk tea but the ambience is super aesthetic and cute only 4 stars because they didn t have half of their menu available lol but i m excited to go back and try their uji matcha items when it s in stock update still no matcha but tried their waffle puff cone this time around and it s super tasty perfectly made cone that s super crispy on the outside and soft in the center not too sweet so the cone with the ice cream aren t sickening like other places i also appreciate that the cone is cooled a little bit before the ice cream is placed in so it s not all melts right away sassy owner though not sure i wanna come back now
5214,this is my favorite place for mexican meals always come out piping hot and delicious we love the seafood burrito but haven t had a bad meal the chips and salsa are mediocre but the meal makes up for them the margarita and beer selection is also plenty and they keep pouring as requested
5215,the spot sabrina s is understated and so good we had the chicken fajita melt as a wrap the man child had the torta it s a must if you re in the mid town reno area
5216,i had a coupon for a 5 00 meal i was not expecting all i got for 5 00 a leg and thigh which were perfectly cooked my sides were fresh coleslaw a good sized side salad 2 flour tortillas warm and fresh fresh salsa and a large diet coke the service at the drive thru was fast and courteous this location is so very much better than the one on prater in sparks i will be returning frequently
5217,words cannot express how amazing this place is i almost don t even know why i m writing a review because what else can possibly be said if you live in the state of indiana and you have not been to milktooth get with the program what s holding you back the countless amazing reviews the countless awards milktooth literally made it onto a reputable list of top new restaurants in the world google it so i had the grilled cheese sounds simple and boring right nope if it were legal i would seriously consider marrying this thing it is hands down in my top 5 favorite meals ever and i love food i ve had lots and lots of food it s just that good salty and sweet is my absolute favorite combination and this meal nails that directly on the head it s fabulous beyond words the bacon what to say about the bacon also amazing it s so thick and it s covered in this sweet sorghum glaze and it s the perrrrrrfect consistency texture and i just love it it s basically a huge chunk of salty sweet meat get in my belly the coffee is also superb lots of breakfast places serve up burned coffee simply because it has been sitting in a pot all day not cool i can t say that i m a huuuuge fan of the layout though i despise communal eating and some tables are definitely meant to accommodate multiple parties this isn t nyc i d like to disgustingly devour my bacon meat chunk in solidarity and peace tip 1 know that milktooth is not cheap my meal without the bacon and coffee included was 16 at the time whoa but it s worth it tip 2 expect a wait even with only 2 people in my party i ve never gotten in without at least a 30 minute wait but again it s worth it tip 3 order a pastry and some coffee while you wait just head on inside to the counter and order up with all of that being said i heart milktooth
5218,awesome company love their vans and melissa has been so accommodating she is very professional and always followed up with our group
5219,i heard about this place in south florida so i decided to check them out the food was excellent the staff were very professional courteous and prompt this was a great experience keep up the good work blues city deli best regards jacqueline
5220,what a fantastic place to eat we have eat here several times and never walk away hungary the food is always very good and the girls waiting tables are the best if you cannot enjoy every part of this experience you almere not hungary to start 2 thumbs up definitely a 5 stars from me
5221,i really enjoyed the bibimbap got the one with tofu it came in a hot bowl there is outside seating which is nice but i would probably sit inside the next time
5222,this restaurant is right off watson but offers other entry ways from side roads there is also a drive through you order at the counter they call your name to get your food like a bread co seating is limited so be ok with sharing a big table with strangers there are two double seat tables and a table for parties that are 3 people or more i ve been twice and have enjoyed my food every time the bacon is ultra thick and crispy and the gravy is so good and has a lot of flavor but isn t over salted the iced coffee is great and has coffee ice so you don t get watered down coffee i have asked for one refill at both visits and have gotten them i have a very spirited son and he loves this place there are crayons as well as an open kitchen to watch he also loves peeking in the bakery window and seeing what the back of the house is doing
5223,okay so we were so hesitant to try this place but we are so glad we did the service was friendly and accommodating the quesadilla with chipotle chicken was amazing guacamole is fresh and so so good i literally can t be more pleased with this place five stars will definitely be back
5224,dick made this awesome drink it was an amazing drink to start the night the drink was hand crafted and was fun to watch what a great place to have a drink
5225,yesterday was my second visit here and i didn t think it could be any better but it was the first time i stopped by on a whim allen did my gel mani and was great i am extremely particular about letting nail techs touch my cuticles but he was very gentle and i had no pain the gel manicure was perfect and he didn t take off too much of my natural nail during the process the second time i made an appointment with allen and he took just as much care and payed as much attention to detail as before complete with a hand massage with hot lotion since the shop was much less busy i know that tipping is expected but from my experience the employees here earn every dollar they re all very nice offer drinks have not tried their wine yet but it s an option and are very timely with patrons i ll keep coming back here as long as i m in nashville already planning to bring my mom here as a treat when she visits and don t be fooled by the west end location prices are very fair for the area and are really worth it for the service
5226,this is my first visit in their new location it s been awhile the front porch was a wonderful place for brunch there wasn t a lot of room but it was enough that you didn t feel obligated to participate in your neighbors conversation unfortunately they were out of espresso but the standard coffee was more than fine and the attentive server kept my cup full i had mama s eggs because avocado it was a generous serving that i didn t even finish the grilled chicken sandwich was also very large but was devoured quickly the side of fruit was fresh and not the standard melon variety the salmon salad has a large piece of salmon on top and the server had no problem with a few substitutions that were all taken care of when the salad was served the server kept the ice tea and water glasses full it was a reasonable price for an above average meal
5227,good service and nice a quit at lunch time even though the place is full a little warn in the place but the place was clean and was such a good time will be coming back
5228,while vacationing in santa barbara my boyfriend and i came across cat therapy while wandering around the town intrigued we went inside to find out more and see what exactly a cat cafe was the girl who was working there was so welcoming answering all of our questions happily and excitedly you could tell she really loved her job she told us how cat therapy was an adoption center for cats who had been rescued from kill shelters they offered an hour play time with the cats and kittens as well as organized events such as happy meow r and cat yoga we opted to sign up for sunday cat yoga the yoga class wasn t challenging and would be considered more of a basic yoga class but it was one of the most relaxing and fun yoga classes i ve ever taken the cats are free to roam around so as we were doing our downward dogs and chatarungas or should i say cat arungas the kitties would run underneath you rub against your arms and legs and sniff at your curiously a few of the kittens even fell asleep on top of the class goers during savasana myself included it was a truly happy and stressful hour and i would definitely recommend to any cat lover one of the more unique things i ve done in a long time
5229,cons this bar has a very very very limited food menu but the kitchen somehow takes up 1 3 of the restaurant not sure what that is about the prices are extremely high in proportion to the food quality and portion size a chicken sandwich that is a little bigger than a slider for 13 no fries a side order of fries is 4 and about the same size as fries in a happy meal 17 tax and tip and unless you re 9 yrs old you will still be hungry pros the staff seem very friendly especially the redheaded bartender she is very pleasant and accommodating they have a nice beer selection and you can buy a growler to go of your favorite beer the wings are really good too
5230,love love this place food is exactly prepared as the original location on christian street in s phila the mel s chicken cutlet is my favorite and the greek salad is next we always introduce our friends to this place bc we know it will b delicious
5231,really liked it i think we will go back the food was tasty and definitely filled you up i wish that i had found this joint sooner the banana foster pancake was delicious i had the chicken sandwich one thing that i was disappointed about was they forgot my avocado on my sandwich and my server only checked in like twice and i couldn t find him so i had to ask the bar for some help it s hard to find a good spot closer to the water so kudos for that
5232,i had an amazing experience at alic motors trenton and all the guys there treated us great i found exactly what i wanted for an amazing sea it was a quick and painless deal the follow up from them has been superb i highly recommend them to you
5233,best cuban sandwich i ve ever had they ve taken the best elements of the cuban and each flavor is balanced yet deliciously bold i ve been enjoying cuban sandwiches from all over the bay area ever since i was very young michelle s is memorable the fluffy ham flavorful pork and cheese on garlic toasted cuban bread is a winner not to mention their generous and fresh deviled crab
5234,dave was very responsive to our review and has since made it right we will be going back in the near future and are looking forward to it
5235,love the food here the fresh ingredients and the taste of everything is delicious i had the sea bass which was very good the pizza had a good combination of toppings the gusepie some waitresses explain the menu really well others not at all they also don t have straws there are really so many other ways to reduce plastics and this town still gives out styrofoam in places and plastic grocery bags just gave straws on request and move on don t go with the paper ones they don t work so it isn t perfect but the food is so delicious that it doesn t matter
5236,really enjoyed a st pats dinner with the wife it was an hour wait for a table for two with no reservations on a saturday night but they had seating right away at the bar apps drinks and meal was awesome definitely recommend for a nice meal on a date night service was very good too
5237,great salon friendly and clean a shoulder massage while you dry go here for mani and pedi
5238,great pizza one last week and another this evening love the thin crisp crust good quality cheese and tomato sauce delivery was quick and arrived nice and warm the order taker on the phone repeated my order back to me twice and the driver was courteous
5239,had a blast my fianc and i went last night and attempted to complete speakeasy we were so close we were grouped with another group of adults 21 and it was exciting to see how well we could all work together only having just met leave yourself some time to find parking as you have to park on the road they did a fantastic job at setting up the room and it was definitely challenging
5240,i have had a great experience every time i have visited red ponty the setting service and menu are all top notch in spring or fall check out the screened in patio out back for drinks and snacks
5241,just what donelson needed i am so happy this place opened up in the neighborhood their version of huevos rancheros is so freaking amazing and their baja fish tacos are bomb i ve only been twice so far but both times have been such a delight honestly i feel like this place is really boosting the popularity of donelson we are more than just a farmers market thank you nectar
5242,kyle and karissa are the absolute best come see them and they will take care of you
5243,we ran in for a late night dinner last night the prices are definitely high both couples decided to split a plate you could tell the annoyed our server and the food was good but not worth the price for sure i will say the garlic bread they bring out before the meal was ah mazing i could have probably eaten my weight in just the bread overall i probably wouldn t eat there again myself but it could have been an off night there is just too much competition in the food world around st louis
5244,great food and hot cooks who you can stare at openly party the feta and pita are famous but the fried quail is where it s at great jump off point
5245,one of the better coffee shops in town the coffee is rich and flavorful not weak by any means their sorbet pastries and omg the ginger dragon delish not to mention the staff and how kind and happy they all seem love love love this place
5246,we ve been here a couple times for their build your own hash i ordered the salmon hash last time with poached eggs and hollandaise it was sooo good only reason i didn t give them 5 stars is pricing 14 16 for the hash and it s not full service dining
5247,this is a self service pizza place where you get your own drink napkin utensils plates condiments and they ll bring you the pizza the pizza was really good the restaurant is clean and open environment and the staff are very friendly the selection is great too
5248,really nice dog i d say 4 5 stars definitely better than the current 3 5 rating big portion all beef got mine with everything yummy sweet ish chili onions ketchup mustard really good bun and they serve it to you out of giant hog dog cart right on bourbon street the smelliest nosiest craziest street in the usa
5249,excellent service has air conditioning which is great in the south my favorite was the chicken chicharrn chicharrn good location in the block is the best one
5250,staff was so friendly ordered the classic and grilled pork and it was amazing and fresh the bubble drinks was also very tasty and not watered down soft bobas for the win will definitely come back
5251,delicious unsuspecting little gelato place i had the nutella crunch which was delicious i never would have thought to combine those ingredients i will be back
5252,my boyfriend and i went to this bar after leaving a show at house of blues it was a short walk and an easy decision to go into the bar it looked so cozy and welcoming there was a fireplace and not too many people the bartender was conversational and respectable at once i ordered the vegetable sandwich with no cheese it came out with cheese a common mistake and the bartender was extremely accommodating and apologetic we enjoyed moscow mules there all night by the fire and didn t want to leave,the food was very good the french toast was huge and had pudding in the middle the tofu sandwich i had was delicious can t help but mention that i got very pretentious vibes from this place the owner seems very nickle and dime ish paid 5 for a small glass of blood orange juice i saw there is a 25 for each entree to go and a 2 up charge for syrup wack server was very awkward and we didn t feel welcome,potstickers were good but the lo mein my boyfriend got weren t even cooked they were just hard uncooked noodles and some peppers
5253,a local told us about this nice coffee house on our first day in nola it s nice and clean the guy behind the counter was nice and the iced mocha latte was great if your looking for great inexpensive coffee this is the place
5254,great new juice and smoothies place spotless and fast friendly service menu has raw juice selection various smoothies bowls and until 11am steel cut oatmeal bowls with an array of toppings and you can customize all of it you can call ahead for orders and then pickup dedicated parking in the front give this place a try
5255,healthiest lunch option in the cool springs area by far sure there are other places that offer a good salad but grabbagreen really makes sure you can t get distracted by the add ons like that extra brownie for dessert i ordered the gulf of mexico bowl with chicken instead of shrimp everything was fresh and great quality but overall kind of bland the avocado dressing just tasted like a pureed avocado which isn t necessarily a bad thing but if you re looking for a flavor punch that dressing will not suffice if you get chicken it s ground meat instead of chopped just fyi in case you don t realize it when you order i think the ground chicken definitely makes the bowl look more like that classic clean meal prep lunch i m sure there are other bowls with dressings that are far more tasty i mean they even have a healthy mac and cheese but when i come here it s either the intention to go all the way and eat as many greens as possible as others have said grabbagreen is a great option if you re really trying to stick to a healthy eating habit or if you re like me you eat here when you feel really guilty for eating a bunch of junk days before there are quick grab and go items available and fresh made juices and smoothies so it s a great option to add to your cool springs lunch rotation
5256,this is a great place for young kids 10 and under my kids are 10 and 12 but we hadn t been here in a while so they enjoyed it lots of animals unfortunately the only ones we got to pet and feed were the goats they were very appreciative though the wildlife trail was interesting too it is not an all day visit we went through in about 2 hours little ones would probably play longer lots of stuff to climb on an interactive play area both indoor and outdoor there was also a separate farm house with smaller animals like hedgehogs and reptiles this farm has an excellent outreach program that our pta used last month highly recommend this for an educational assembly program the kids learned about nocturnal creatures and loved it there are also scouting programs and the staff is very knowledgeable check out their weekend events lots of fun for little ones give it a try
5257,emmitt was hilarious and i had a lot of fun on this tour thank you again would highly recommend
5258,new owner owns a few restaurants and upscaled the menu but still reasonably priced i got the bacon wrapped filet it was cooked perfectly and was top 3 i ve ever had and i ve had prob close to 50 different steakhouse offerings before also offer cheaper sandwiches that looked amazing too bar offerings could be expanded a bit but i m sure they are working on it
5259,3 days here been here twice incredible pancakes we got the buckwheat pancakes the first time most gluten free option very delicious would highly recommend the second time we got the banana batter pancakes with pecans the sweet potato pancakes and cornbread pancakes of all these the sweet potato was best but the buckwheat ones were the best the sweet potato and banana were too sugary for my taste two stars down because the eggs were very eh and the line was really long expect to wait we waited over an hour to get in and on top of that we waited another 50 minutes to get our food
5260,i loved this place but drove by today to see it was closed for business and there were for sale signs in the windows
5261,traveled to indy for a conference and needed a solid place to take customer out to eat elmo s was booked and heard this place was just as good and under the same ownership i actually liked the atmosphere better as it is brighter and more updated than elmo s shrimp cocktail was amazing same as elmo s salads and steaks came out perfectly prepared and the service was great i was so impressed i went back to back nights with different customers
5262,breakfast wrap grilled on pannini press uh yes please we came back today because we had one last week and it was so delicious i subbed out tomatoes for spinach added mushrooms and had gorgonzola for my cheese oh my do it you won t regret it assuming you like those ingredients we split a side of fresh fruit it costs 3 but it beats a load of greasy home fries nice change up and it was super fresh lady next to us got the bananas fosters french toast which looked really good the place is so small so seating is at a premium but the food is prices well and very good if you can grab a seat or have a short wait it will be worth all your breakfast desires
5263,i came here for brunch and now cannot wait to come back for dinner the space is huge and very well appointed and beautifully decorated we split a pastry and shared an appetizer of the classic hummus to start the hummus was the best i have ever had smooth creamy and perfect flavor the waitress quickly offered us more pita which is a nice touch we both had a lebanese flatbread the cheese tomato long hot parsley and the lamb bi ajeen with egg both were flavorful and perfect cannot wait to come back now that the garden space is open bonus if you don d feel like dining in there is a small market cafe in the front we both got items to go
5264,if you are into mediterranean food this the place fresh and super tasty very nice service as well highly recommended
5265,beer garden review if you are looking for a casual evening with some beer and your basic pizza and fries this is it the pizza has better crust than lariele they have created a great cozy outdoor environment in the beer garden i just wish they had more draft beers and more pizza options but hopefully those are coming the service was not great waitress seemed annoyed and took a while to come back to table the arancini was eh you are served with plastic plates and forks so definitely a casual setting
5266,this place has great atmosphere but the menu is dumb it s just a few phoofy pretzel sandwiches that don t really go along with drinking at a bar it s like they have an identity crisis it s not really a german style restaurant but they re charging high prices for a limited german style menu they just need to get some damn wings burgers nachos and regular bar food in there and would it kill them to get at least one belgian beer in there every bar in nashville has nothing frickin ipas lame also they re not open on sundays so you can t go there to watch the game so why the tv screens then so we can watch dancing with the stars it s just doesn t make sense are you an actual village pub or just a fake north korean store front
5267,food was good drinks poured right atmosphere is cool service was fast and friendly fortunately we didn t get one of the man bun servers lmao visiting from california and we have enough of those snowflakes there i was hoping nashville was man bun snowflake free other than that i d recommend this place and i ll probably be back
5268,very great mexican cuisine different than chipotle it has spicy tofu also available for vegetarians very flavorful will definitely go there again
5269,amazing staff bean pure with bread appetizer was interesting i tried to like it but it didn t win me over the waiter said it s a 50 50 hit bruschetta was very good gnocchi with pink sauce was basic the pasta itself was bland and the pink sauce tasted like it came from a jar spinach ricotta ravioli with red sauce was tasty two for one wine before 6pm yes i was eating early
5270,my sister and i have visited tarpon springs three times once a year and hella s is always our destination for lunch the service is spot on and the food is great i have had their gyro which is tender and succulent and full of good flavor i also have had their cod and it was a pleasant surprise i never knew that cod was that good my sister has also had many of their dishes and really liked them one hint get there early otherwise you will have to wait for a table highly recommended
5271,wow got in time before closing i had the corn beef reuben but i choose not to have the sauerkraut with 1000 island dressing on rye it came with chips but i added a up charge for a nice small salad no tomatoes my choice unfortunately the rye bread was burnt i would have never served it she didn t even ask if it s to well down burnt but o did eat the beef which was tasty g had the philly cheese steak it had onions no peppers it has a great outside deck great view of the waterways but besides that we won t be going back
5272,went here for the first time for an acai bowl and it wont be my last had the tropicale and will be back to try more friendly people laid back atmosphere and i am sure a whole lot more that i haven t explored
5273,i had a great time eating lunch at ichicoro the service was fantastic and food was delicious i ordered ramen noodles with pork belly and it easily became my favorite this is one of the best ramen places in town i only give it a four star because my family makes ramen and i m biased with how ramen should taste however ramen at ichicoro is a must have it s full flavor and the broth is well prepared i only wish that it could be a little less salty then again my taste buds are hard wired differently overall i recommend this place if you want to have a unique tasting experience in a hip place downtown
5274,the food was ok typical take out chinese food i would eat here again only because its super close to my house i got the chicken with garlic sauce it had a little spice to it and the sauce was very sweet the portion was a nice size i had plenty left over i also ordered a spring roll it was about the size of an egg roll not the best spring roll i ve had
5275,mamas kitchen is just like what the name says mama s kitchen the owner and employees greet you like an old friend and make you feel welcome the menu has a wide variety to choose from along with specials i ve eaten there twice but haven t thought to take a pic before i devoured my delicious home cooked meal i had the pepper steak last week excellent today i had the country fried steak and i can only assume they bring you a steak knife as a joke your fork falls through it topped with a delicious gravy and accompanied by real mashed potatoes and tasty green beans with bacon and whatever you order get the garlic bread all of this for a fraction of what you ll pay at most restaurants in tampa i ll definitely go back
5276,there s always a wait every time i ve come here from my personal experiences the meals are too overpriced for what you get the juices can be found much cheaper at other restaurants and while they are good they are no better than any other juice bar i ve visited to be so pricey
5277,this place was pretty good it was a little too noisy for my liking i had the falafal and that was delicious their hummus was tasty too but the customer experience was a bit off as they don t have their processes down quite yet i m going to return in a few weeks and see how it has developed
5278,best sushi and chinese in all of northern nevada i eat here as often as possible they always have fresh delicious food made just the way you like it great atmosphere and friendly staff
5279,the caesar salad is worth the trip alone and i highly recommend the proscuitto and spinach pizza paul is a great guy and every time i ve been in there he s gone out of his way to say hello and check that everyone is pleased
5280,i love this place i love that there are 2 size options for bowls and smoothies the green bowl and ginger smoothies are my go to though i ve loved everything i ve tried would be awesome if they had recycling bins for the water cups etc at least didn t notice any at the la cumbre location a bathroom would also be nice
5281,old glory is killing it this place is currently 1 in my book especially for late night drinks the vibe is dark and dungeon like and the music echoes and bounces off all the brick and steel surfaces like nobody s business dimly lit with little nooks and crannies where you can get all zoned out with the special person you re with the drinks are amazing and the bartenders are tatted up eye candy plying their craft with perfection you must visit this super cool place soon because this hidden gem will be harder and harder to get into
5282,atmosphere and food very good the strawberry lemonade sangria was good but excited to try something different if we come again server great all the way up until we ordered after that we didn t see him until we were done eating had to ask manager for napkin and server took plates without asking if we were done maybe just overwhelmed or new will try again though 5 tasty burger wiis hard to pass up update visited bar louie again last night after a long day kayaking on the river food and company on outside patio did not disappoint upgrading my rating to 4 stars as alexandra kept us hydrated nicely and provided great service with her bubbly personality hoping first visit was just a one off
5283,i m really very impressed with the selection here i m not nearly as impressed with the price but where else can you get such a huge selection of foreign beer there s not just your usual belgians and germans either i was happy to find japanese russian and even some lithuanian and polish bottles to choose from there are even some quebec based brews you can find here du de ciel sticks out that i haven t found elsewhere in the philly area i ll be back just for the selection alone you won t find anywhere with more inventory in the surrounding areas i ll cringe when i see the high price but try to remind myself it s worth it
5284,food great staff better sangria to die for located in a very unique building the old water works building on main street
5285,very clean and friendly environment everyone was so polite and helpful also very knowledgeable i must say i ve been to other eye care centers and i never had such a great experience like this one very pleased
5286,i found anna marie thanks to groupon sometimes you get what you pay for on groupon but anna marie is amazing i switched from my previous wax spot to adam eve and i m so happy that i did she uses hard wax which in my opinion is far less painful than soft wax she was pleasant to talk to kept the conversation going to avoid those awkward moments and made me feel comfortable
5287,out at the end of the pier the mussels were really good the sourdough bread was not homemade but the overall vibe was well worth it
5288,the food was very good i ordered this take away and it was ready on time and the order was correct and the food was tasty i would go back there again next time i am in tucson i would also recommend this for anyone looking for quick food that tastes good
5289,ordered the trout sandwich and didn t really know what to expect it ended up being one of the best sandwiches i ve ever had in my life so good that i m writing a yelp review about it which is not typical for me absolutely delicious also ordered the butcher cocktail which was very good as well highly recommend
5290,definitely will be back looks like a hole in the wall and the place is rather warm but the food was great service was also great they made recommendations but i loved the avocado omelette
5291,beautiful place to stop for a drink and a view of city park the bartenders are always lively and courteous and they make an excellent pimm s cup on a muggy new orleans day they re a bit on the pricier side but their turtle soup and catfish with the smoky grit cakes were quite tasty on a toasty sunday morning and as a bonus they do bottomless mimosas
5292,delco s finest always great for some late night eats and a cold beer on the outs with gravy fries every time
5293,this is hands down one of the best if not the best pizza i ve had and this was a gf dairy free pizza usually with those requirements pizza tastes like garbage but even my husband said it was phenomenal better than his the amount of toppings you can choose for only 8
5294,the food and service very good our party had a variety of dishes and everyone really enjoyed and the prices are reasonable a definite return visit is in store
5295,the place is nothing to look at but the service was wonderful and the ramen out of this world we will go back for sure
5296,great food for a great price every time i have gone in to bab cafe the staff is always super helpful and educated on their product and make recommendations would 10 10 recommend to anyone
5297,while our food was wonderful i got the feeling you have to be a regular to get service here we watched as the bartender skipped over us to make other drinks after she took our order while it seemed they were very friendly to people they knew we were new so didn t feel very welcome i can see why people go back because our dinner really was delicious also for being a saturday night our wait time was not bad at all
5298,cool fun art filled place with great staff we stayed nearby but came here for breakfast and to hang out at the pool bar everyone was very welcoming really wonderful staff at every turn good coffee many spaces with different personalities to choose from wonder what the rooms are like i might stay next time cabanas surround the pool all ages of people were enjoying themselves it would be 5 stars for me if there were more plant based food like maybe a tofu scramble for breakfast and some non dairy cheese for the flatbreads the pastries in the front lobby looked good and there is a spa and a shuttle their avalon property next door looks beautiful too
5299,i took my kids and the line was pretty long the cinnamon roll was a bit hard and the toppings were not that great i feel like the price for what you get is not that great of a value i prefer cinnabon at the local mavricks
5300,there are a lot of bar b cutie locations around town however this is the best one i ve ever eaten at i get their chicken bbq sandwich combo with fries for about 8 50 it s lean and good quality meat with excellent sauce you wait a little while for your meal to be made for you that s why the fries are always very fresh excellent brewed iced tea desserts are pretty good but they are charging a bit too much for their banana pudding it s not worth it
5301,working with mike at sparks florist was a great decision and a delight i came to him with a crazy idea and he worked closely with me to design something that would fit my vision and my budget then he went above and beyond to make sure it turned out beautifully and it was a real show stopper i d definitely recommend mike for any special events or wild ideas you have
5302,my husband and i went to dinner and decided we wanted to dine out and get some pizza although i have been at a different giordanos location i think this restaurant fits downtown perfectly when you walk in the environment is cozy and the customer service is great i am a fan of pizza like it s a necessity in my life we ordered a deep dish with chicken sausage and banana peppers needless to say we enjoyed every bit of it our waitress was awesome and was very helpful i absolutely love the eat pizza sign in the restaurant it adds beauty to all the pizza lovers out there when i want to sit down and enjoy pizza this is the place to go pros pizza taste delicious environment is nice customer service cons marinara sauce could be better pizza takes 45 minutes but that s ok
5303,what a great place the owners are super friendly and make such an effort to make you feel welcomed from the minute you arrive the sandwiches and soup are delicious though i d probably skip the salad the next time around also don t miss the gooey butter cake it s made in house
5304,great personal service clean environment and great working machines plenty of room for folding clothes sandy was a great help when i forgot my hangers thx shout out to deb also
5305,i ll say this anything worth having is worth waiting for and i am so glad that i waited a cup of coffee and i was ready for the grilled shrimp bloody mary incredible i had the fleur de lis omelet stuffed with crawfish and topped with etouffee with a side of boudin simply delicious use the wait in line app the food takes a minute to get out but the service was delightful and so worth the wait
5306,gorgeous historic hotel rooms are clean and classy wonderful service and staff would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the french quarter
5307,visited this pb to get car inspected i was taken on time and back at my house w in the hour 4 stars because there seemed to be a lot of confusion at the check in desk but i have to commend them for not trying to force a sale for other services in order to pass inspection i cannot tell how often this has happened to us thank you pep boys
5308,red shrimp was delicious soup was also great and very hot only complaint is that my entree was not very hot and when i asked to heat it i can see the microwave in the back where she took the food to reheat it also the waitress had a table outside and wasn t very attentive
5309,great bowls sauce all of the ingredients were fresh and healthy service was great i m going to become a regular at this place
5310,at first we thought it might be a bit expensive however the quality exceeds the pricing
5311,was rather disappointed in the service we found our own table as requested to do but wait staff continually walked by without even acknowledging us after ordering a flight of their beers again it was a long wait not impressed by any of the beers one even tasted like soap have tried other flights at other breweries and find it a great way to pick a favorite but not here
5312,another fun stop in our quarter quest the chicken wasn t wow but still good the slushees are bomb a must stop on tour of the funnest place on earth
5313,purchased the class as a gift for my parents they loved it thanks
5314,amazing coffee stopped by coat coffee for a latte and they were out of bags of coffee so i decided to go tinker s store so glad i did such a nice shop and they helped me pick out a great bag of coffee can t wait to go home and brew me a cup
5315,had a great meal at burger study it was a nice night so we enjoyed the outside seating a table of four we all got different burgers and everyone was very happy i got the prime degree which is made with dry aged beef so good the dry aging added some great unusual flavor for a burger so many good burger options on the menu but i d be hard pressed to order something different on another visit we ordered fries nothing special and onion rings very solid version not too greasy as sides drinks were good too large beer selection and a good cocktail menu the service was extremely friendly but a bit slow especially given that it was a relatively quiet night at the restaurant would definitely return when in indy unfortunately not that often and in the mood for a great burger pretty much all the time
5316,my husband and i loved this quaint donut and yep slider restaurant we stumbled across the first night we were in nola we wanted a light night snack their donuts are amazing they are cake like donuts very dense but delicious we were there during mardi gras so they had a king cake donut just awesome also we had the sweet and salty carmel and pretzel dipped chocolate yum a couple of days later we went back to try the sliders they did not disappoint perfect and the waffle fries were excellent you could add cheese if you wanted i wanted but my husband didn t i lost highly recommend
5317,i had a really great first visit to growler s taphouse the beer selection is really great and our server made some excellent selections i usually don t expect much food wise from a place with a lot of beer but the food here was pretty great i ordered the pork sliders and chips salsa the hot salsa was so good
5318,the service and food here is wonderful we came in a party of ten and had to get out in a rush to go they were extremely nice packed up our food and the atmosphere of the restaurant gave us a first great impression of nashville as it was our first time visiting we ordered the tuck hot chicken chicken and brisket sandwiches and everyone loved theirs nothing was oily and everything was reasonably priced i can t wait to come back again because everything was delicious
5319,servers were attentive but pizza took over 30 minutes and that seemed to be the average for any order volcano buffalo pizza was pretty tasty celery on a pizza who knew
5320,exceptional food and service our waitress was very funny and charming maybe the best calamari i ve had and delicious drunken noodles also my wife is vegan and they had a whole separate menu for her which she appreciated greatly
5321,eric detailed my wife s 2015 range rover and it looks better than it did when it was brand new i have had many vehicles detailed over the last twenty years i ve never received my vehicle in better condition than new i didn t even realize that was possible definitely worth every penny and i wouldn t go anywhere else as i am sure i would be disappointed
5322,great service conch fritters were delicious will visit when in town again beautiful view of the bay
5323,this is one of my favorite breakfast brunch places in town friendly staff and amazing food if you didn t bring cash that s okay there is an atm on site the atmosphere is rather homey
5324,amazing food fun vibe and very friendly staff i have loved coming here for a long time but recently i have been even more impressed by them i have several food allergies and i found this place to be very allergy friendly i am not sure if they are accommodating to all allergies but they have a list prepared explaining which options are safe or not safe with certain food allergies which i thought was very thoughtful
5325,owners harry and luke with his brother phillip are all apart of this small but tasty establishment they have small medium and large bowls where it is a chipotlesque feel if you choose a small you get 4oz of protein 4oz of toppings all your choice medium 6oz for each and large 8oz prices proteins and toppings are all listed on the menu on the picture
5326,the most authentic mexican restaurant that i have been to in new orleans excellent food and good service the highlight for me was the green salsa which is the best i have ever had
5327,the food was delicious everything you can ask for in one plate i was able to make a reservation on yelp so i didn t have to wait the staff was friendly
5328,this is a cool little hole in the wall place but i wasn t it s biggest fan although it was good food i ordered a banana and chocolate chip pancake and it took almost 30 minutes to get out to me the waitress was very sweet the environment was cool i guess it just wasn t for me,it was decent food but i m probably not going to go there again i just ate it and can already tell that my stomach is going to receive the repercussions for it haha the staff was very nice and gave me no problems
5329,visiting my daughter and decided to check this place out food was great and the service is excellent you feel at home here
5330,so i meant to just go in and get a croissant or danish here since i ve been looking for a decent one here in reno but managed to get distracted and buy a bunch of other things to try instead because all their options looked delicious i ended up with a poppy seed pastry a baguette and coconut cake all were pretty amazing the coconut cake was light and not overly sweet and i 100 will need to go back to satisfy my sweet tooth
5331,this place was great love the cozy atmosphere inside this second level restaurant with great people watching views the cocktails are tasteful and fun and their wine selection is good the food was delightful we started with the beets and then both ordered the seasonal sweet potato gnocchi with a panna cotta to satisfy our sweet tooth for dessert overall experience was lovely and our server joe was so welcoming and attentive definitely recommend this place to all and will be back again
5332,such a fantastic shop so many beautiful pieces from so many different designers everything from stylish clothing to handbags to home decor and then there s the jewelry oooohhhh the jewelry if you re looking for unique pieces funky inspirational it s all here top that with two wonderful business owners that are on site and so friendly i fell in love with this shop my very first visit to safety harbor and make it a point to visit every time i m in town there s always something new fabulous there s so much to choose from it s quite addicting and somewhat dangerous ask them about the husband list and did i mention they ship outstanding
5333,good service and nice ybor city feel great place for a cold brew coffee people watching
5334,holy bat crap this place is amazing go to place in st pete anything on the menu was good food coma
5335,they make great cakes we use village bakehouse for all of our special occasions and they always knock it out of the park
5336,one of the best dinner options in carp it s always a highlight of our annual family pilgrimage to this fabulous little beach town fresh delicious food and ridiculously large portions the kids meals and the special combination dinners are insane values kids meal has good small people friendly options pad thai fried rice etc plus salad fruit and beverage special combo starts with soup or salad includes 3 apps fried wonton spring roll and a fried shrimp steamed rice and a massive entree portion we love all of the thai curries pad thai pineapple fried rice on our last visit the special appetizer was tempura avocado with a pineapple lime sauce not to be missed if you re lucky enough to catch it
5337,affordable amazing service and a great location i loved grabbing dinner here with my husband for a quick date out i would have tried everything on the menu if i could have but make sure you at least try the baklava will definitely be coming back
5338,the staff did very well for a new location very friendly and great service the porterhouse steak was cooked exactly as i requested glad to have a closer location to me upon leaving it was pouring and the staff was offering unbrellas and walks to car in order for us to stay dry
5339,well for the price we paid the server was condescending and the food was good but not spectacular we had the goat cheese and crawfish crepes turtle soup seafood bayoubase shrimp and grits bread pudding and cremebrulee although the food was quite good it lacked content not much turtle in the turtle soup large portions of grits compared to shrimp and a few errors with our drinks and bill the most challenging lo engine part was trying to get our server to not be condescending and to find her excuse for being so well stuck up perhaps there been riding on their notoriety for too long
5340,exceptional entrees exceptional service and many very healthful options one of our favorite local venues recommended without reservation
5341,finally had the chance to check out the infamous falafel cart nazi at 20th and market what an experience if you re not familiar this guy has been in this area for close to 10 years maybe longer and he has a reputation for making high end restaurant quality meals with whatever he s got in the cart that day there s no menu no alterations unless you want all veg no bag no utensils just the ridiculous meal about 2 lbs of food all for 10 today he had fresh made turmeric semolina pasta in a slightly sweet and spicy sauce that i can t quite pinpoint is the base with freshly grilled chicken the most perfect falafel grilled peach strawberries grapes and sprouts micro greens the balance of flavors and textures from the platter blew me away the sweetness from the sauce and fruits on the front end is brought back a bit when the spices from the falafel and chicken and the smokiness from the charred bits from the grilled chicken and peach kick in what a meal honestly two meals for 10 also if you plan on checking out his cart make sure you have a little extra time because there will be a line and he only makes one platter per person at a time
5342,the food and service were just like the old days at tony angelo s this time we had the marinated mushrooms lobster cup now a seafood cup and veal parm next trip will definitely be the the feed me
5343,fantastic dinner and great setting oysters were the best i ve ever had nice to sit by the window and watch people outside excellent service from terrance and the other staff
5344,i actually found this little gem by looking on yelp it was a little bit of a walk from our hotel but well worth it we went for breakfast and i got the breakfast bowl and it was super delicious everything i wanted for breakfast in a bowl i think i would get it with bacon next time instead of sausage just to be easier to eat my husband got the yogurt and granola and a side of hash browns the hash browns were seriously so delicious the portions were pretty big so you could always split something sweet and savory i couldn t stop starring at the cupcakes and cakes but it was 8 30am so no room for that this trip also i have to mention how friendly the service was right when we walked in we felt welcome and can t wait to got back i would say go early because it s a small place and seems like it would fill up fast
5345,made an account just to write this review breakfast culture club serves my favorite espresso in santa barbara in fact it s some of the best espresso i ve ever had better than even the best i ve found in la sf it has a fruited sweetness to it a hint of red fruit perfect mouthfeel and insane sweetness their beans are from coava which i d never had until coming here and the espresso blend is just brilliant i think they used to use coffee from handlebar which also makes good espresso but i m very glad they switched because coava makes a much more interesting espresso handlebar is good but very typical roasty toasty notes caramelly but definitely not fruity i like to get a gibraltar a cappuccino or just straight espresso the gibraltar and cappuccino both bring out the strawberry notes of the espresso and end up very sweet because the espresso is just great here the texture they achieve on their milk is fantastic as well exactly what i want in a cappuccino that said if i want something with more punch i just go straight for the espresso their toasts are also very good i think they ve changed how they do toasts since previous reviewers posted they prepare the toast for you so it actually is instagram ready if you re into that as for ambiance this place is perfect the opened garage door makes the whole place feel very open and spacious strong hipster and surfer vibes around you ll often see people barefoot also usually a couple people working on their laptops there s about 4 or 5 power outlets available usually i ve been able to get a spot with an outlet if i need it but in the morning it can be so busy that it s hard to find a free table with an outlet highly recommend stopping in here if you like fruitier espresso drinks
5346,my wife and i are now in the routine of a once a week visit to number one china buffet for a take out dinner our favorite dish is the hunan chicken and veggies along with pot stickers fried rice and fresh green beans just the right amount of kick fill your plate in minutes from the buffet extravaganza and out you go in minutes dddtv fan steve h
5347,this bakery has amazingly talented chefs so far they have delivered a superb product that not only looks great but tastes sooo good the women are wonderful the prices are really good and it s nice and clean inside they did a phenomenal job on my husband s 50th birthday cake and a super awesome job on my nephews birthday cupcake cake i was just so overwhelmed by the beautiful job they did and everyone at both parties were in aww of how great the designs came out i just cannot say enough about this bakery and the wonderful job they do
5348,nice people very affordable large portions that i can eat for two meals probably the cheapest smoothies in downtown manayunk 5 out of 5 for adorableness
5349,first time in the nola and this spot was a must on our list our wait wasn t long and the food and service was superb being from maryland we know seafood and all of the seafood was cooked and seasoned to perfection their sesame ginger chicken wings were amazing and stuffed mushrooms were perfect appetizers for our entree s we have the seafood platter salmon and the ocean delight we will definitely be back and i m blown i left my leftovers s o to larry marrow for a top notch place dcornothing
5350,conceptually awesome my wife and i popped in early friday evening for our first visit the environment left us feeling as though we were at a beach bar restaurant we tried two appetizers grilled shrimp and smoked fish spread both were well prepared and delicious for entrees emily had the grilled snapper tacos and i had the gag grouper dinner both meals were delicious the issues the exist can easily be corrected it is summer and this is an outdoor venue you order your food at a hut located behind the bar however you have to stand in the hot sun while ordering a canopy needs to be installed there is no pricing listed anywhere so you order and then get surprised by what you are asked to pay what we ordered was well worth what we paid but it would be nice to know what you are spending before you order the only menu is a series of high end cocktails all of which sound delicious however the bartenders are not adept and creating these wonderful concoctions so the delivery is not as great as the written word suggestion cocktail napkins or coasters they won t blow away and ice alcohol melts the ice so load the glass up because the florida summer heat melts the ice also the plastic wear is fine and works well enough but the little piece of paper in the package is not sufficient to be called a napkin serve and extra real napkin with the utensils one thing for sure we will be back but at this price point a few additional steps need to be taken by management and crew ps your rocking your idea morgan smile and look less stressed even if you are cheers
5351,i was starving and was looking for something to eat on eat24 i can t really drive and go to places to dine in because i just had a newborn and its not easy getting around sometimes so i was looking for something via delivery so since i haven t had tacos in a long time i decided to give this place a try with all the good reviews i d see sorry to say it wasn t the best tacos i ve had in philly i d ordered the tacos al pastor it tasted sweet with little to no flavor and i had asked for the red spicy sauce but why was there green spicy sauce on my tacos although i like how you can choose your own toppings but it wasn t my kind of tacos i love trying new places and once i found the place that fits my expectations i just stick to that one place but this one wasn t for me i ve ordered burrito for my boyfriend s daughter and the portion was huge but i took a bite and it was just okay i m not really a fan of burrito anyway delivery was quick but i don t think i ll be return
5352,great food and amazing service not only were the tapas creative they were very well priced david was our server and he made the whole evening he is a gem and really great at his job
5353,i had their salmon grilled plank style with chili onion corn side and it was seriously very delicious their in house warm baked apple pie was the topper of the eve had good wine beer rejections too great service food drinks and lots of huge tv screens for those wishing to cheer on favorite sports will definitely return here arlyn
5354,amazing chicken and waffles and french toast went here with my kids and husband and we all left full and with awesome food probably the best chicken and waffles i have had and the spicy asian sauce with them made it even tastier would definitely recommend
5355,i went to this restaurant recently for a date it was certainly a great date spot cozy and romantic the food was very fresh and seasonal items were highlighted in the menu we bought a can of wine to split between the two of us which was unique and different the quality of that too was very good however the menu was limited for vegetarians though the restaurant really tried to accommodate i had the kale risotto which was very filling my date who is also vegetarian had a tofu steak th tofu steak was very well done of good consistency and had barbecue sauce i wasn t a fan of the barbecue sauce because it think it could be better nightlights with an asian or mexican style barbeque sauce we also had the torched broccoli and crudits platter and rolls with chive butter for appetizers all these were good though i expected the crudits to be pickled and they we re not the reason i gave this a three star is because i think the menu while innovative had hit or miss items i look forward to seeing the change the menu up in the future
5356,i feel like this place is a hidden gem i say that because every time i go there are barely any people there they have incredible food and an awesome happy hour menu i always sit up at the bar and the bartenders are awesome
5357,fun place to get together and meet people staff is wonderful and friendly people make the difference barrio is a destination because of their focus on customer service a regular place we frequent
5358,fun place to have some very good burgers and fries good selection of draft beers and a cooler room that has a great selection of bottled and canned beers
5359,this place is just adorable the inside decor is very trendy and cool and the outside has twinkly lights hung up and is great for people watching i got the ben s bread and it was really yummy and had all sorts of bread with different cheeses and toppings great appetizer i also got the nutella iced late and i really enjoyed it because it wasn t overpowering but you definitely taste the nutella most of all the service is great our waitress sierra was very friendly and helpful and the entire team really made sure that i had a nice visit i suggest this place to anyone looking for a snack or coffee in nashville
5360,for a beer lover like myself their beer is phenomenal it would have been nice to get a heads up on social media about the canning release s popularity and that there would be potentially people waiting for 5 hours to get the new cans we traveled from far away not realizing there would be a 2 hour wait outside down streets from the actual location i honestly can say i love their beer and it might have been worth it to wait but if i had a heads up i would have been prepared to wait on a line of sorts
5361,the best place to jet ski by far great people great service great prices unforgettable experience i will be back each and every time i m in the area
5362,we visited with a group of middle school students after a philadelphia orchestra rehearsal we emailed for a reservation on the bus on the way into the city they were so gracious and took us at the time which was most convenient for us the food was awesome pizzas for the kids and salads for the adults plus delicious bread knots with olive oil and roasted garlic our server was so sweet and gracious i will visit again in the future good food and pleasant service what else could anyone ask for
5363,good food i love their pastrami sandwich with spicy mustard wish they had more ipa s on tap they only have two laguanitas and sierra wish they d offer a few local brewery s ipa s the restaurant is a little dark but in a hot day that could be refreshing in be in a dark cool restaurant
5364,best surprise in nashville with stellar service and an amazing menu eggs benedict the way it s supposed to be prepared a breakfast wrap comparable to none we ve ever had elsewhere bananas foster pancakes designed to raise moods and blood sugar at the same time the place is always open and did i mention stellar service i m certain our server two days in a row was jillian if i ve misspelled her name i beg forgiveness she makes the experience wonderful this diner elevates the concept of the lunch counter to a social and culinary event
5365,food is fantastic service is quite awful call ahead if you can so you don t have to wait it took us 10 minutes to have our server acknowledge us once we waited 35 minutes for a table it took another 10 15 to get coffee and were never given cream we were given a pitcher of water but had to ask for glasses so we could drink it they are understaffed and we visited on a saturday morning when they were having a special event so they should have known better food was amazing and my fianc loved his coffee we definitely got better service at the warrington location so if you re thinking about trying this place out i would say go to the warrington one they also have a better waiting area and full counter service area to get coffee while you are waiting
5366,this is a gem my daughter found some pieces i jus wish they had more for my size and age range worth a visit
5367,we came for craft frozen daiquiris and oysters and were not disappointed happy hour is 4 7 daily with 2 off daiquiris and 9 dozen raw oysters they also had wine specials and a cocktail of the day for drinks we got a frozen pimm s cup and a singapore sling which tasted pretty strong and served in a classy styrofoam cup for our takeaway pleasure we also ordered a half dozen chargrilled oysters because my girlfriend wasn t a fan of the raw oysters we ve had in the past in nyc the cooked oysters were solid but i really thought the raw oysters were the star of the show they were fresh and huge and surprisingly did not have that strong of a brine taste something that seemed to be characteristic of oysters from the east coast my only complaint is that there was grit and sand in all of the oysters that didn t bother me too much but just be careful on chomping down immediately after you slurp because you might bite into some hard pieces my girlfriend ended up eating half of the raw oysters which was a huge step forward for someone who had previously hated raw oysters that said she still preferred the grilled so depending on your preference you can t go wrong with both
5368,as an active runner my shoes are my life force endurance house has a fantastic selection of shoes for all runners the staff are always nice and helpful what sets them apart from other stores is how they check for what shoe will best suit your stride and reduce injury i will happily keep coming back and know that i will get a good price a great pair of shoes and have personalized help
5369,we had been driving around for some time on a weekday last week this was our last time in town as we had sold our home in alton so after going to 3 different restaurants and finding that they are closed for various reasons we decided we would come here wow seriously everything happens for a reason and wow we were maybe one of the first patrons in the restaurant upon opening the ambiance is lovely we were greeted warmly initially and the warmness continued throughout our visit as i said prior the ambiance is lovely the decor is so just want to take it home the service was impeccable our waitress was attentive friendly knowledgeable and smiley omg the food the food we had their summer special holy cow were they fantastic entrees were seafood shrimp alfredo and our friend and i had the steak honestly you cannot go wrong with anything that you order from tony s top notch old school dining experience which is rare
5370,yes it is a bit pricey but after several visits i can say i have yet to receive any questionable food always tasty
5371,a great local beach bar with an amazing view i have been here several times after moving to hudson the staff here is very friendly and will go out of their way to assist you their mahi fish tacos are definitely some of the best around
5372,these were amazing mardi gras snowball stuffed with cheesecake i got the throw me something mister and my husband got the fat tuesday
5373,i went to spa nails before and that place was terrible i came here and had a much better experience the nail technician listened to what i wanted and made sure that i was happy when i left i got gold foil because i couldn t find a salon that did gold foil my cuticles were amazing after and the gel lasted 3 4 weeks definitely will be coming back when i need another manicure in reno
5374,customer service is amazing went for my first oil change here and besides not having to get out of my car it was so quick and easy everyone was so friendly polite and informative i will never go anywhere else for an oil change and will make sure that i tell everyone about how awesome this place is
5375,there isn t much seating here for families but whole entire families come to this place anyway and rightly so the food is delightful i m strictly a burrito man but when it came to making a freshly rolled no tricks kinda meal this burrito was worthy of its rather large weight i think it has some special sauce that might be ranch dressing mixed with something else but anyway it s tender if i lived here one would see me entering the cuernavaca with a fifty gallon jug meant to use for filling up with water or rainbow gold but this time i would be filling it with only chx burritos add avo so i could store them in my fridge for later shame i don t think they would taste as good fresh the staff is nice and freshly governed by og man behind the register who speaks both english and spanish come grab something i heard the cuban meal takes the cake too great work remember reader this isn t about michelin stars here safe friendly good food
5376,3 5 stars it was pretty good i ve been to the center city location and the manayunk location and thought the food was similar here you order at a counter sit down and walk back up to get it when they call out your order it was dead inside so that did not pose a problem here i ordered the tan tan ramen which was decent i thought they noodles lacked flavor at first but it was better by the end when they had absorbed the broth a bit i felt it was a bit expensive i paid 16 for the ramen and a soda i was however very full by the end of my bowl so i guess i can t complain too much this place is not nearly as good as terakawa in chinatown since i don t work in chinatown this is a pretty good backup it is much better than that awful ai ramen place in the liberty place foodcourt i m sure i will be back
5377,yes they are open i had been told that their soft no advertising opening would be later in the month we stopped by and visited for an early sunday lunch with no advertising and not even their web site showing that they are open yet there were not busy for them we have eaten at the locations in fishers greenwood and some south side chicago locations years ago when we lived in south chicago suburbs in comparison the employees here seemed more friendly the only down side were our hamburger buns were very soggy assume from the hamburger meat being so juicy we will return again once their grand opening rush has passed
5378,best tacos and salsas love all the locations but malvern is our go to spot wonderful prompt service as well thanks
5379,this place is burger heaven everything was delicious if you want a juicy burger this is the place to go
5380,bab is a great place to go on your lunch break for something filling yet healthy although the bowl i got couldn t used some more flavor i was so full after getting about halfway through but didn t feel guilty at all since it was basically just vegetables definitely would recommend
5381,first time customer i decided to go for a mani and pedi friday evening after work my wait time was less than 10 minutes friendly environment and great customer service they have so many polish options dip powder seems to be their most popular which i ll try next time i wasn t to thrilled about my pedicure because the work looked a bit sloppy but my manicure turned out beautifully i will be a returning customer
5382,we can t wait to come back okay so we decided to come to new orleans for my 30th birthday and stay with the ace we asked for a few things to be in the room before we arrived and oz at the front desk went so far above and beyond to make that happen for us literally what a star allison and cici helped us out during our stay as well and both are rock stars sadly these are the only names i have but i can say that everyone was so nice to us and made our stay so wonderful the rooms are spacious and perfect for the vibe of the hotel great products in the bathroom comfy beds and blackout curtains perfect for sleeping in they re totally hooked up for music with a record player as well as an intuitive bluetooth set up awesome minibar with all the fixings and a full fridge which was great to have for all the leftover fried food you accumulate in nola we didn t get a chance to eat at the restaurant but it looks adorable the lounge has super yummy cocktails and there is usually complimentary popcorn to snack on attached is a stumptown coffee which was so convenient for us as we head out to explore there s a rooftop pool and bar restaurant called alto that is so fun heads up it is open to the public so it can get crowded that said we didn t have a hard time finding some chaises to set up on the eternal summer was my favorite drink up here we actually made it to the gym once it was great clean towels cold water full set of weights and a couple treadmills all good but we didn t spend much time here i think that covers it really looking forward to returning
5383,everything here is super good and relatively affordable they have stamp cards and students get discounts if you re super hungry you can get a bowl but it s great for even snacking i love to order even just a side of rice and put the little spicy teriyaki on it the employees are super welcoming and enthusiastic and the entire environment of the restaurant is overall wonderful
5384,all three of my kids went to wings daycare and loved it we loved how active they were all day and the teachers were great it was always fun for them when they could go to planet kid or the rock wall or swimming or field trips great place
5385,this place is so sexy chill vibes with a low beat of music playing in the background but not loud enough to over power your conversations it s an awesome date hang out after work or a nice meal spot the food is equally sexy and delicious we sat at the bar and enjoyed it the sushi rolls i had were some of the best things i put in my mouth fresh and amazing
5386,first time eating here food was great sandwiches and sides tomato basil was super fresh and rich delish very fresh cheesy customizable even a byo salad for healthier options staff was super helpful with options menu checking in on us at the table great experience will definitely be back
5387,the food was pretty good the wait for my chicken was really long i had to wait for 25 mins just for chicken slices they didn t have a lot of sauce for the shrimp but it was pretty good it only took 10 mins for the shrimp to come out
5388,excellent pizza and pasta lunch and dinners plenty of selections and they are very willing to modify a dish to your preference fast friendly service
5389,i highly recommend sunday brunch here every thing we had was great of course we sampled some pours of whiskey parking on a sunday was not too bad but was meter parking our server was very attentive i forgot her name
5390,great local place food was good and drinks better try to get here during happy hours it gets kinda crazy after w the college crowd for some reason we lucked out since we stayed across the street,went to get a half and half today the tortilla soup was good the southwest chicken was bleh first it s not really a southwest style chicken sandwich no spices at all besides the onions second the inside was cold apparently they didn t leave it long enough on the panini press and something completely not related it took them what seemed like forever to just make this combo alas the service was pretty good and thus the 3 star i think something is just not quite right both in the kitchen and out front to cause these kinds of rookie mistakes would i come back probably not
5391,love the food here we have never ever got oily bad food from here it has always been great
5392,if you like soft serve ice cream yelo d offers something different filipino flavours i had a swirl of ube purple yam and buko coconut in a cup it was served with a few fruit loops the coconut flavour dominated but the flavours are subtle nonetheless and not quite as sweet as other ice cream you can have it served in a black cone a regular cone or a cup the place is small so you might have to wait on line especially on a warm summer afternoon you can also get other treats and the service is very friendly,a cafeteria of my dreams so many choices of coffee cold drinks sandwiches prepared salads treats and even small portion of nuts and candy it makes my head spin there is a buffet of hot foods sold by weight a sandwich bar for custom cold and pressed sandwiches daily soups pasta and more i had an egg salad wrap that was absolutely packed and so fresh i even liked the lettuce which i normally don t but it was crisp and doesn t have that weird taste i sometimes notice at other sandwich places and the prices can t be beat if you can avoid the lunch rush the service is reasonably fast
5393,best place late night authentic simple food great service and friendly staff food was awesome had the breakfast wrap
5394,we had a gift card and came on a tuesday night the food was delicious my husband had a 12 oz rib eye he said it was the best he has had in years alan was our server excellent service and they have cardboard take home boxes
5395,salvadoran food extraordinaire this gem is tucked in a small strip mall behind a gas station don t let the not in plain site deter you from the goal of authentic dang good food papusa s are wonderful as well as everything else on the menu its slammed at lunch but worth the wait if the weather is nice usually in reno there is picnic tables available on the east side of the building as well leave them a nice tip when you pay the bill at the counter mmmmm
5396,the beds were a 10 the rooms were clean the breakfast a 10 those potatoes were the best in a long time for 28 dollars less we stayed closer to the hospital the first night didn t sleep well as the beds were horrible two nights at the four points helped us get through a tumultuous time maids and wait staff were all exceptional i ll be searching four points whenever i m heading out and about we were visiting our daughter at the hospital and the comfort really helped
5397,i ve had a good experience with fort lowell realty so far kathy flores has been responsive from the time she showed me the property we re currently renting to letting me know what i needed to do throughout the application and lease signing process when we relocated and picked up the keys to the house there was a slight snafu with having the correct keys but kathy responded immediately and helped us get in to the property right away we were pretty road weary from driving 1600 miles so it was a relief that she was so quick to get back to us the woman at the front desk whose name i don t recall was also super helpful and friendly also love that there is a tenant portal that houses the lease agreement lets us pay online and therefore we re assured that the payments have been received and everything is track able
5398,please support this small neighborhood shop everything you need and plenty of personal assistance so helpful big box hardware stores make me totally crazy and you have to buy a bag of everything even if you just need one
5399,first of all i am super excited to try this new restaurant i believe this is the first shanghainese based cuisine in nola i can taste some of my favorite childhood dishes tonight chef hao did a wonderful job bringing his experiences from japanese cuisine into this cool new restaurant as well chef was able to preserve the traditional shanghainese cuisine taste while adding elements of fusion dishes of japanese sichuan cuisines this was a delightful and the most welcoming dinning experience i have to bring my friends and family back again
5400,we were craving vietnamese food after 2 days of southern food we had a group of 17 peeps here from cali heard great thing about this place from our friends came in at 11am and was seated right away we ordered the egg rolls spring rolls and crab puffs as appertizers let me tell you if was awesome we then order pho chicken and pho filet let me tell you the broth was right on point and the noodle and meat was awesome the owner mr tran came out and talk to us to see how everything was excellent staff service also we shall be back next time we come back into town
5401,small menu seems like a neighborhood diner atmosphere we had the biscuits and gravy and the slinger which comes with sausage instead of hamburger iced coffee is truly just black coffee served over large chunks of ice food was good but nothing was great very small dining room with family style communal seating first time trying but probably won t be back
5402,when this place first popped up on my phone as hot and new i was so excited to try this place it s always so exciting to try new cafes and ice cream places that pop in reno since there really isn t many trendy places like these it was interesting to see the cute wired sign and pink wall the man at the register said him and his fianc started this business so i wish them both luck he was very welcoming very informative the soft serve is so creamy the way it should be the flavors are so yummy it was nice to see familiar flavors like ube and green tea for some suggestions maybe a thai tea or strawberry flavor it was nice that we were offered pocky sticks to add to our krem creation maybe next time if adding wafer sticks or some type of cookies would be nice i got the ube baby baby and it was delicious i ll definitely be back for more
5403,i had a wonderful experience at this place kaitlyn is a wonderful hairdresser and did a amazing job

5406,our first evening in nashville we decided to try the tavern restaurant it is quaint and dark davis was our server and he was great and very accommodating i had the burger which i m sad to say wasn t anything to write home about the best part of our meal was the great service we received from davis
5407,a great place to enjoy malaysian and thai foods the restaurant is spacious and comfortable the service is excellent for the food it is super especially the curry dip with bread definitely we will come back again
5408,this is a great place today was my first time there and the guy at the register noticed i was kinda lost with the menu so he offered his help and explain how it works for the food and drinks he was very friendly and helpful i ordered the egg and cheese on an everything bagel with cheddar cheese and added bacon with a small coffee there is a self serve coffee and tea station so you make your drink to your liking even though my breakfast sandwich was very simple it was delicious i would highly recommend this place
5409,we just had a drink and dessert here my husband had the fried pie it was apple he said it was too much like mickey d s and that it needed some cinnamon i had the ice cream sandwich which was a sugar cookie with vanilla ice cream and marshmallows it was good
5410,this place reminds me of lucille s bbq in ca but with a more authentic feel you re greeted as you walk in and order at the front right away you go to your table then your food is brought to you it s very flavorful and each meal has its distinct taste there is also a few beers on tap as well as many canned drinks i haven t had much southern food but this was great and the atmosphere was right thank you for a great experience
5411,had great coffee and king cake great little local atmosphere breakfast looked great
5412,brevity truly is the heart of wit and at the heart of the where should we go to eat tonight the answer that will keep you coming home smiling is tre lune this 3 moons dining experience is over the moon not because it is so over the moon expensive but because it is so dependably great and the staff all are great you are taken care of the food seriously good and the experience is half ny and half italia all in montecito great work over time tre lune take a bow

5417,we are frequent patrons who enjoy their super fun bar tv s and music selection the service is very good nice hard working mannerly people in a very cool atmosphere that appreciate the business food is consistently fresh seafood and good pizza is the best in south jersey and my husband the unofficial pizza officianado makes me try them all from nyc to trenton to philly delaware chicago this is really the best pizza i ve ever had the crust is thin crispy yet has a nice chew and flavorful last night i had a dinner special of chicken cutlet in a lobster white truffle oil light cream sauce with asparagus shallots and sundried tomatoes over angel hair pasta on the special s menu it is listed as a veal entree but the kitchen was more than happy to substitute chicken for me the dish was so delicately seasoned with such a fine touch that i enjoyed smelling it almost as much as tasting it in addition it was such a generous portion that i enjoyed it two nights later for dinner and now want to go back tomorrow and order it again what an absolutely fabulous recipe very fine subtle flavor but also comforting and satisfying not to mention selena the bar manger bartenders jayna and chris are just so pleasant professional and helpful it really is a great place to go enjoy
5418,open early has what you want friendly and knowledgeable staff the repair shop messed around with a bad wheel i had for an hour and didn t charge me a cent when it couldn t be fixed
5419,this is a great place not sure what everyone s complaining about to get a comfortable clean hotel room in the middle of a metropolis in any city much less philadelphia for a rate of around 100 is amazing george the receptionist was super helpful and kind he called us soon as we got to our room to see if everything was ok how nice and it was ok lovely shower with good pressure fridge bottle water microwave this is a great place to stay parking across the road for only 17 with validation from the hotel for 24 hours
5420,great to coffee patio and gluten free tasty goodies have not tried lunch items but look great
5421,love this location good bang for your buck and the staff is really friendly love coming here with my husband for breakfast on the weekends
5422,i recently stayed here with my husband and had a wonderful time the hotel is beautiful the location is perfect and the carousel bar is one of the best bars in new orleans but my main motivation in leaving this review is to thank a man that works there named malcolm who helped me tremendously one night he did not hesitate to assist me and went over and beyond we will definitely be staying here again
5423,good vibe and bartenders great beer selection yummy cocktails most importantly get the street tacos and cheese curds they were amazing

5425,ichicoro ane is a true diamond in the rough came out for the first time with a group of friends and got a chance to try a variety of dishes along with the black mage cocktail which became an instant favorite the menu has a little bit of everything on this particular night i got a chance to try some of their popular dishes from the japanese pancake yucca beer cheese fried tofu with seaweed devil crab halo halo and others can t say one outshined the other i truly enjoyed every dish i tried i liked the flavors and the creativity in all the dishes the bar waiting room looked like the ultimate man cave they have a limited choice in spirits but what sets them apart is the rare and exotic choices i can see myself returning in the future this place is ideal for a quick bite or boys night out i liked the vibe and the music just added to the atmosphere
5426,i have heard about this place from a few different people finally made it in and it lived up to the hype ate here with a friend realized she had lost her wallet as soon as we sat down valet was super polite brought the car up for us to check it it wasn t there ended up having to run home found it in the drive way and came right back the host and server were very patient and polite about it food was awesome we got multiple apps to share servers name was kath she was great from the hosts to the food and service we ll definitely be back
5427,really good red beans and rice with andouille sausage slow service keeps it from being 5 stars though
5428,we always enjoy eating here coffee is exceptional and helps to pass the time as they get very busy i recommend reservations on the weekend
5429,excellent food dk and sarah are very friendly and make you feel most welcome it s a great atmosphere as well
5430,i used uber eats to get a buckin bacon breakfast wrap holy cow this is the best breakfast burrito i ve ever had the sauce is tangy and delicious it took less than 20 minutes to receive and arrived fresh and hot will definitely be returning
5431,5 stars for the sushi we ordered 3 specialty rolls and one basic and the size of each roll combined with flavor and quality were excellent the salmon skin was super crunchy which i love and the amount of lobster and crab on the southern california roll was frankly staggering 13 the service was the only draw back as our server was not overly attentive and it took a minute to place our order but it was a snow weekend and i think they were short handed we ll definitely be back
5432,didn t know that this was blake sheldon s place we here for a private party the place was beautiful love the flow of the chair set up bar and stage place was also clean and their food was delicious we had biscuits mash potatoes fried chicken pull pork mac and cheese brussels sprouts and some salad stuff and all were delicious i love their fried chicken crispy and crunchy this place was lively and groovy i also loved their live camera and great lighting and sound system
5433,wow found this place looking for brunch near rittenhouse square the staff are friendly the coffee amazing my friend mentioned their popcorn and we found out that they only serve it at lunch i am from massachusetts so i won t be able to come back but they brought some popcorn out and the smoked salmon eggs benedict were delicious
5434,our server was top notch we ll be returning tomorrow and we re only in santa barbara for 3 nights if you like crab this is your spot 4 different kinds of whole crab on the menu also order the coconut shrimp
5435,we made a reservation for 12 people and we were really late due to the lack of parking and expensive parking in clearwater they still saved our table which i thought was super nice of them we sat down at 11 21 and they still allowed half the table to quickly order breakfast breakfast is served until 11 30 and then came back around to get lunch orders sawyer was our server he is fairly new and considering they were down staff he worked his butt off to make sure our table had what they needed as expected meals came out in shifts since that is how they were ordered but the food was so fresh and flavorful my husband got the grouper tacos and didn t leave a bite on his plate i got coconut shrimp and those were delicious as well we had plantains seasonal veggies which was some grilled squash and cheese grits all were just really good everyone at the table really enjoyed their meal honestly the only reason this is not 5 stars is because we did wait a bit for drinks food but they handled it with such professionalism we ll be back ps best place to park is probably the hyatt parking garage or the one next to it the hyatt is 15 for the first 3 hours then 5 per hour after the one next to them is 15 for the full day
5436,clean excellent service and the sushi rolls were equally as good as anything i would pay full price for
5437,so glad we stumbled on this place great vibe excellent music and the food was ridiculous lamb sliders yes fish tacos yes gumbo and the bulgogi rice bowl washed down with a fancy drink you can t go wrong
5438,thoroughly happy customer that has been frequenting in riva for years now it is by far our favorite restaurant we make it a point to head there at least a couple times a month their pizza specials during the week are too good to pass up service and beer menu is always on point and perfect ambiance on top of that this will be my greatest heartbreak when we inevitably move from the manayunk east falls area
5439,have ordered takeout from this restaurant several times and figured it was about time to leave a review outstanding is about all i can say every time the food has been excellent and we have had everything from platters to sushi to egg rolls to soup the staff is also very friendly and packaging is very professional will absolutely continue dining with this restaurant
5440,minus 1 star because the price doesn t justify the portion great music and quaint atmosphere but the price should be like vs limited menu with only appetitezers not full on entree we got a lamb slider that only came with 2 tiny sliders for 12 the chicken gumbo was also small for 9 new orleans have so many places with great food i highly recommend another spot but if you want to come here for the food expect to pay and still be hungry if you for the music and drinks it s a good spot to check out customer service is average
5441,y all wiz kid has the best vegetarian cheesesteak ever and it s just a bonus that it s vegan the wiz kid philly grilled mushrooms and seitan fried onions and rutabaga wiz is so so so good having tried the rutabaga fondue at vedge i knew the rutabaga wiz would be great but i was still so blown away by its deliciousness the sandwich is super meaty and filling i can t wait to go back and try other menu items but let s be real it s going to take a lot of willpower to not order the wiz kid philly
5442,didn t get in from the airport til about midnight food was decent especially for late night fried seemed over cooked maybe that s a brutish thing philly steak sandwich was good but not much cheese
5443,really good experience with kathy she got the carpet 6 weeks before home depot was going to and inatalled it the next day she is a pleasure to work with and i highly recommend her company
5444,i let the action speaking they have the best cup of freshness tea guarantee from the top to the bottom of my drink stays the same taste unlike others bubble tea places contact water more than what you paid for you are getting a whole drink that are cold hot ready they have their owe logo for interior logos cups be sure to try the waffle
5445,yum yum this is a cute little place located in the heart of broad ripple we came about an hour before closing we got 2 regular cuban sandwich s and the rice bean pork mixture the staff was friendly the restaurant is clean and i love the decor the food was really good the sandwich was so filling i had to take the other half home i could have went w the mini we will be back for sure,i have been dying to try this place and finally did the inside is gorgeous white and yellow decor everywhere the restrooms were super clean sasha did my hair she started by having me look in the book of styles i went w the mai tai we started w a shampoo i could get my hair shampooed all day by someone else after that it was onto be dried this was relaxing they have a big tv w romcom playing loud music there are no mirrors so you cannot see what is happening which is fine bc i just love having my hair dried while they put product in your hair they explain the products the product is displayed up front but no prices so i felt it was expensive and i hate asking prices i feel if i have to ask and it is too expensive then it is awkward my reveal was great loved the style i did end up buying 2 products which was more than i have ever spent on any products in my life but my hair is normally dry and it felt like silk i am posting 2 pics one from that day and one the next day i can imagine this style lasting me 3 days i would come back for a special event or just to treat myself
5446,this review is long overdue as we are frequent patrons of this great neighborhood place i have never had a bad meal at dagwood s we love the lunch menu selections which include a serving of soup and salad from the self serve bar their lobster special from 12 to 5 with a 1 pound steamed lobster corn on the cob and boiled potatoes is fantastic and a great deal at 15 their crab cakes tuna sandwich burgers and any seafood with pasta are consistently excellent service is always attentive and prompt thank you for being in the neighborhood dagwood s and we will continue to be regulars
5447,the best sicilian pizza around delicious shrimp chicken caesar salads we will be back great service almost a little too attentive we were interrupted quite frequently while trying to eat
5448,illegal tacos offered a great burrito full of protein and authentic flavor for around eight dollars easily something you could wrap and take home to finish or finish on the spot the space itself is somewhat limited on seating but the patron turnover seemed steady so waiting a few minutes for an open table doesn t feel impossible i enjoyed the food here and feel content with only needing to eat here once while in philadelphia for a few days
5449,my husband and i are visiting nashville from chicago go cubs we have been to tavern once before last year and my husband fell in love with the chickenooga drink so in love that tavern was our first stop back in town well one chickenooga into the night and there was an issue with the keg equipment making this drink unavailable the manager soon came over with a substitute option replacing the beer they very well could have just said too bad but went way above and beyond and made my husband content great food too but the service is well above the rest
5450,great tour offering a lot of facts about importing our table sugar salt coal etc saw many goats used in shrimping and fishing enjoyed every bit of this steam boat tour i didn t see the other steam boat until the next day and so glad we booked a tour for this steam boat this boat offers great seats and great views the other boat looked more like a tourist boat with benches lined up the oh not so comfortable feeling steam boat natchez is the way to go
5451,good quality ingredients poke bowl was a huge portion after some questionable poke in montreal this week i was starting to get worried that good poke was only a west coast thing fortunately i was wrong this was not exactly a traditional poke bowl kind of a lot of carrots and corn but the ingredients were fresh and high quality and the portion size was very generous i think their 16 poke bowl was literally twice as large as a 13 poke bowl would be in seattle and these are airport prices service was not super speedy especially since i was there in the early afternoon when there was a staff changeover and it seemed like they usually have fewer customers at that time of day but today it was pretty busy if you re in a hurry you can order anything off the menu to go or there are premade sushi containers in a fridge whose quality i can t vouch for
5452,hands down one of the best dining experiences i ve had mark the gm is the best very cool and food was superb
5453,we had a great time at baileys range tonight bradley was our server and he was a delight we can t wait to go back and visit him i would recommend the big popper burger and horsey mayo to everyone
5454,extraordinarily average food is just ok and portions are small and pricey service is meh restaurant itself is beautiful and it s not a bad place to grab a happy hour drink but i wouldn t eat there again definitely not one of jose garces better spots
5455,this is a beautiful restaurant they have an extensive menu we ordered the small greek salads and we each had a lamb dish everything was delicious the portions are huge we definitely will be back to try some of the other dishes
5456,good food fast to go orders the red beans and rice was great and ton of food and the crawfish pasta was delicious
5457,just moved into the neighborhood and was looking for a good barbershop i saw good recommendations for the barbers club so i stopped by i was not disappointed really awesome staff talented barbers and great environment the boss was even walking around to introduce himself and socialize with customers great cut and shape up 100 recommend and i will definitely be back
5458,delicious food quick efficient and great service the owner is really nice and always helpful a must try
5459,this place is amazing if you want good pizza come here if you want good food off broadway come here or you re missing out
5460,yep if you want high quality food for a discerning palate then here s your place service adequate to good the 3 times i ve been there all about the food
5461,the whistle stop is a quaint little breakfast and lunch spot it is a family owned business and the entire staff are friendly and cheerful they always make you feel welcome when you re there it is located in historic downtown plant city fl in 1896 it was known as a drugstore this is a cute little town with several restaurants and gift shops when in the area my hubby i stop here for lunch we always enjoy our meal the bread is always so fresh it s delicious i have to say that i ve never been anywhere where they take your order and serve your sandwich at lightning speed i m always amazed at how fast they make the sandwiches sandwiches are usually served with a sliced pickle and a bag of chips the sandwiches are generous and they are priced very reasonably i hope if you re in the area you give them a try for lunch
5462,the line was very long waited 45 minutes on a saturday morning at 9 45 am in july but the food was fantastic the pigs in a blanket with the cinnamon sauce they provide was amazing
5463,i have a finicky dog and one lucky dog has the only treats my little girl will eat the staff are always so warm friendly and helpful i especially love heather who grooms rosie she comes back to me so soft clean and beautiful and the prices i feel are very reasonably
5464,max did a great job redoing my drink after coming from another starbucks where i was unhappy with what i got thank you max,emma the manager is amazing and all the ladies that work here are amazing i love the workout and my abs are coming along nicely
5465,when you absolutely have to satisfy your sweet tooth this is the first place you should consider no matter which cake you choose you have chosen wisely a friendly staff will let you sample whatever your eyes are set on
5466,we met another couple for dinner and they suggested murph s based on a previous visit i m always up for someplace new but i was blown away with my dinner at this little unassuming bar in fishtown a nice beer selection i had a kona ipa and a belgian from local st benjamin s both were really good we ordered the zucchini blossoms and received three of them stuffed with pillows of ricotta with a thin batter and lightly fried a product of the season here today and gone next week these were totally worth it also ordered the caprese salad it came with an extra dollop of mozzarella cheese drizzled with balsamic and oil along with a piece of crusty bread this was excellent as for entrees my wife had the salmon wrapped in thin slices of zucchini and it really worked i had a pasta dish with an unpronounceable type of pasta that resembled small penne with a spicy sauce and pork cheeks another hit this was one of the best pasta dishes i ve ever had and was cooked al dente murph s is a great neighborhood gem and a must visit when in the area
5467,perfect place to take our electric tricycle for an after the playa rehab open on labor day for returning burners dwayne is such a great hardworking and friendly guy said he d get it done for us in a day and he did easy access from reno easy parking fair prices so happy we found this shop
5468,this was r s fave place during our short visit in nola they re famous for their burger or at least that s what r told me we came during happy hour on a weekday i think it was like 4 6 pm or maybe it went to 7 pm regardless we made it that s the important thing because their hh is amaze balls there were 0 75 raw oysters 1 50 cooked on the menu half off of cocktails we ordered a few like 5 these raw oysters were so huge like a little bigger than the size of my hand what an amazing deal they were delicious too the service was nice and attentive oh yeh the burger r loved this burger too i think he just likes burgers in general but if you re a burger fan you ve really got to try their s out we saw other people in tables next to us that ordered like 20 oysters at once despite ordering a small number i think it was satisfying their cocktails are really good too this place is next to the hilton and the crazy thing is that when we walked to our hotel room yup we stayed at the next door hilton there was a luke s takeout bag in front of someone s door apparently you can use hotel credit at lukes and have them deliver i think
5469,small clean and on point with their options menu was a bit limited which is not necessarily a bad thing food was good and the service was solid a solid choice if you re craving korean,overall a great experience i was a little skeptical as we had been to their original location in chattanooga which is only a small ice cream cafe but this location is a full on restaurant prime location near downtown in the gulch the brunch menu was creative and we really enjoyed everything we ordered i suggest getting the cortado cuban coffee if you re looking for a kick to start your day all the biscuits were plentiful but definitely get a side of the sweet sausage prices were on the high end for a brunch but comparable to the entire area
5470,great restaurant with really cool vibes highly recommend sitting on the second level rooftop if you can the menu is great you really can t go wrong for my vegetarian friends out there be sure to try the cauliflower it s amazing
5471,the oysters are the best i ve have ever had scott the master chief has a real passion food
5472,we had gotten the spicy nola bites crawfish cakes and the crab cakes and shrimp alfredo everything was amazing the best crab cakes i ve had so far i know i will be craving the spicy nola bites when i go back home i definitely recommend this restaurant the service was fast and friendly
5473,we stopped in here after our initial lunch idea didn t go as planned my wife and i both like mediterranean food so we figured it was a good option we ordered the hummus which was very good to start with i opted for the caesar salad with shrimp and my wife went with the grilled lamb gyro my salad was quite good the shrimp was cooked well and the spices were unique my wife felt that the lamb was too tough and it may have been because it was sliced in a different way most often with traditional gyros you will see the meat on a rotating spit and it is then thinly sliced off this was just thicker and it didn t work i thought it was cool that they made a point of having shaved chewable ice in their drinks
5474,loved everything about angelina s ristorante the staff was amazing while we sat there waiting for our meal we could see angelina the owner cooking our food with fresh ingredients the pasta was perfectly prepared and the sauce was absolutely delicious we had a party of 16 to celebrate my daughter s graduation the staff couldn t be nicer i cannot wait to return to angelina s
5475,the girls working today sat are super cool pleasant and friendly provided some good info on breakfast specials and different items they offer very good smooth coffee dump the acidic starbucks and support local businesses that provide excellent service and products thanks again for the excellent service
5476,was really nice to visit there everything was laid out and it was beautiful however the snow tubing was a little bit of a letdown long lines and the tubing is not very long also they need to hire better traffic directors one guy got frustrated at us and made a nasty comment that we can hear through our open window as we ask for directions being our first time up there
5477,the food is excellent but bums me out never open on sunday play area clean and well done for my sons safety
5478,food was good no problems there my issue was with the incredibly dirty conditions table we were seated at the floor was awful service was mediocre at best too
5479,i called up this tire kingdom to inquire about the price of two tires including balance and installation for my car i wound up with two good tires and two good new friends with the two guys that work the counter area both armando alicea and ed carpenter were strangers to me when i walked into their store for my two tires each of them were kind courteous and considerate of my needs i felt like they treated me like a member of their family and gave me honest answers not salesman type answers to some of my pointed questions and concerns regarding my vehicle and tire needs there are not many tire car repair places where you will find straight forward sincere advice like these guys gave to me i felt they treated me like i ve been good friends with them for years thanks armando and ed i will certainly see you guys again for any of my future car needs
5480,we had the crunchy french toast and the barn sandwich and both were very delicious try a side of the andouille sausage is was amazing nice ambiance and you can tell the food is freshly made in house
5481,i went there with a group of people and everyone enjoyed their meal the service was friendly and the dcor is festive if you like cajun creole food i think you should give acadia a try you ll love it
5482,good food overall for people not from the area it s kind of just a nicer fresher chipotle with a bar the meats were good and the fillings were nice but you don t really have a lot of options and the guy making our burritos barely gave us the chance to say if we didn t want something i don t like raw tomatoes and if i hadn t immediately said something i would have been stuck with them
5483,simply incredible this really is a special place that puts out some of the best desserts and cakes i ve ever tasted i suggest making a reservation if you plan on dinning in because you never know if it s going to be busy or not you can order at the counter to go as well which i recommend over any ice cream or bakery near here the caramel cake millionaire cake and birthday cake are all fantastic they have good espresso and other coffee options and they have a full menu i ve yet to try anything other than dessert and drinks here gorgeous decor and very well kept
5484,i ate at the milk and honey chain for the first time in charleston and loved my meal i was thrilled to find out there was another location right here in nashville i m happy to report that the milk and honey nashville is just as delicious as the original location in charleston my consistent favorite on the menu is the avocado toast with za tar spice the combination of the salty spice with the creamy mild avocado and crunch sourdough toast is what my avocado toast dreams are made of
5485,good beer not a huge selection but a good lineup this place needs coasters lol because dripping beer all over yourself is not cool but ya good beer and good thing it smells good haha
5486,ride on over to lovely florissant neighborhood for sunday brunch met a work colleague for mimosas leisurely buffet a couple of hours talking on the veranda were on to a lasting friendship reasonable prices fabulous service
5487,this restaurant has very good energy first the owner has very good sense of humor second the food is so good my husband never took left over home unless it is super good and he did this time even though we are on our road trip back to california third we love the mango juice bottle all in all you can tell that it is a very decent family restaurant offering good food and service
5488,in the area and found this location on yelp the young cashier asked if it was our first visit and offered samples before we ordered he even gave us a free gift because it was our first time visiting the food was fantastic full of flavor and huge portions i tried pulled pork baked beans and corn pudding among the best baked beans i ve ever had my husband thought the pulled chicken had a bit of a bitter taste and his mac and cheese looked a little bland he offered to let me try it but i would have had to share my beans and despite the love i have for the man i didn t want to i deducted one star on behalf of his bitter chicken definitely recommend the restaurant though
5489,my go to starbucks staff are friendly and know my cinnamon dolce latte obsession lol i was annoyed when this place was closed for construction because there aren t any really near me other than this one besides the bhp one and there s just too much traffic drive thru here can be slow but it s not usually a big deal since i stop after work can t wait for pumpkin spice to come back because i m basic not sorry
5490,i m from out of town and jess was super friendly and welcoming it really made me feel at home even though i pronounced everything wrong lmao she was helpful and knowledgeable with all local beers and recommended second line desire saison it was delicious i can t wait to go back and see what else she has to offer
5491,this is the best food i ve had the whole time we ve been at nashville in all seriousness the avocado toast with the home fries was the best i ve ever had the staff is amazing and we didn t have to wait for a table i wish we could eat this every day of our lives also my soy latte was amazing
5492,i ve gone here three times now and it does not disappoint it s a sure great location by bike or car the trail directly connect to it the outside dog area is an awesome idea and perfectly executed especially for people like me who don t like leaving their mutt at home my two favorite dishes are the meatballs and the broccoli csar salad
5493,the bagels were very good and the bagel and egg sandwich was delicious also the coffee was excellent the people that work there were very nice and i highly recommend this place
5494,we ve been looking for a good italian restaurant and finally found it the chicken piccata and spinach salad was delicious
5495,had a day off and decided to try a massage here after my karate instructor kicked my butt it s at the ellisburg circle close to work small but comfortable and clean waiting room very friendly front staff easy to sign in with simple 1 page form my lmt was very attentive to the sore parts and i did not feel she was in a rush she gave a firm but gentle massage and i felt renewed afterwards the girl at front desk looked up my groupon for me and it was an easy check out perfect
5496,easy to get a special battery for my 2008 jaguar eric great on the phone and then in person price right no charge installation done right and swiftly 100 happy
5497,i recently stayed at the alexander for 1 night with my husband and dog pros large clean room dog friendly with welcome treats for your dog and a great little grassy area just outside for them to do their business new and modern friendly staff free and easy to use wifi in room keurig and free bottled water cons location was on the outskirts of downtown but very close to the fieldhouse if that s your destination i m from indy but haven t lived here in 10 years so i m not sure if this location is considered decent i just know there wasn t a lot right by the hotel but it is an easy 10 minute walk to a ton of bars and restaurants parking was expensive we parked in the lot right next to the hotel for 30 night no discount for hotel guests i didn t eat at their restaurant so i can t comment on that yolk is right next to the hotel for breakfast lovers all in all a very nice hotel and a pleasant stay
5498,i will dream about you alligator sausage boa until next time i m in nola every bite i took was amazing from the drinks to the dessert
5499,dudes seriously so good so so soooo good the rutabaga fries are the most amazing thing ever the rutabaga cheese is better than any real cheese wiz i ve ever had in my life the reuben cheesesteak may or may not have also brought a tear to my eyes i mean this place is amazing the pot holes brownies holy crap we ate one before we got our food ate left and turned around and went in and bought 2more that didn t make it back to jersey with us don t judge me try one you ll see i wish there was more seating but other than that there s not one bad thing to say some of the best vegan food we ve had yet thanks wiz kid
5500,excellent ambiance great keeping of tradition on meats which are excellent i was expending a bigger bill than what i got happy to find a new favorite steakhouse in new orleans sit in of the booths you won t regret it
5501,first time there and had a wonderful dining experience staff was great and engaging the mac and cheese is unbelievable the pieces of bacon was so good it wasn t over cooked or chewy it was just perfect we had the tater tots for an app and it also had the beacon too for dinner i had the double major it s was pretty much everything the big mac wishes it could be overall the experience was great and what i expected it to be with st elmo s name attached to it i would recommend giving it a shot if you re downtown or on the prowl for a tasty burger
5502,we had a great experience today at bj s ryan our server was very personable and took terrific care to ensure that all our questions were answered the food was flavorful and well prepared we shared a few appetizers and enjoyed the variety that the menu offered our server was attentive and checked on us frequently the drink menu was diverse having something for each of us at the end of the meal we split the pizookie trio allowing us to taste a variety of their options
5503,i rode by this place almost everyday i finally stopped in one day and i m so glad i did best club sandwich ever owner is super friendly and always walking around making sure everyone and everything is great can t wait to try their breakfast,always a good time try the huge soft pretzel with their beer cheese it s enough for 4 people to share as an appetizer
5504,i got a luxury pedicure and it was amazing so relaxing highly recommend can t wait to come back
5505,i ve never been to a village inn as we don t have one near us but have heard about their famous pies we were greeted by chelsea a very personable waitress the hostess other waitress was friendly as well i enjoyed talking with her and used some of her suggestions in my ordering she was really helpful in telling us about other area attractions and restaurants that are good michael s grill has halibut for example that s nice to have good conversation especially if you are learning the area i think my husband actually likes this place better than our local denny s which is saying a lot he s obsessed with denny s for some odd reason the food was delectable reminiscent of my days as a child going to the local hojo s up north only the decor is a brown and orange instead of aqua and peach not sure why the restaurant only had one other patron maybe because we went at 3 pm on a weekday it s certainly not for lack of service because they obviously can cook and serve with a smile will definitely be back
5506,if you plan to dine al fresco be aware that a red arrow bus depot is next door and is busy with at least one idling bus at the supper hour i had the sea food linguini which was no big deal the shrimp were over cooked they no longer had the chocolate mousse and were out of pecan pie so i settled for the strawberry cheesecake which is also not memorable there might be great items on the menu but i don t think i ll be back to try find out the service however was fine
5507,great establishment travel a lot and have visited multiple bl locations and this is by far the best always great service and food is always brought timely and as requested bartenders are very professional friendly and always smiling props goes out to brandy who always does a great job behind the bar
5508,this coffee shop is one of my favorites joe is super welcoming and the coffee is robust and tasty love love love them

5512,very good food fast friendly and courteous clean and upbeat team work in all areas of the business even give employees a crown on their birthday witnessed this myself would recommend to anyone in the lutz area
5513,server was really friendly and attentive only thing i would say is that the prices don t match the quality of the food 9 for a side of fries that were average at best if they dropped the prices or increased the quality of food it would be five stars
5514,this pub is down an ally but it s worth the search the four cheese pizza was good service was good clean good atmosphere two thumbs up
5515,josephine give us the best service ever when we come here we always ask for her we tried different waitresses and shes always the one whos on top of everything food is very tasty and worth for the price check them out and you will love this food as we do
5516,it was my first vist to this shop and the proprietor of the shop is friendly warm and welcoming we saw that there sacred items on the alter that should not be touch or photographed and we respected those wishes not that it was a bother or hinderance we appreciated the fact that energies should not be disturbed we had quite a few questions the owner answered in great detail and even clarified my follow up questions with clear concise answers we found everything we were searching in the amazing shop ignore the negative nay sayers and stop by this wonderful shop and experience it for yourself

5523,this bar is tucked away and really a hidden gem the ambiance is quirky but romantic it is a perfect spot to grab drinks with friends or for a date the drinks are expertly made although slightly pricey this has quickly become one of my go to spots for a cocktail
5524,love love love love this place very entertaining hibachi chefs and unique sushi rolls i also use them for catering a lot perfect for lunch date night or gno
5525,fantastic i ve been craving a poke bowl since i got back from hawaii this place definitely deserves all 5 stars very fresh it was delicious will definitely be back i had a medium bowl with ahi tuna spicy salmon and shrimp only con service seemed a bit rushed
5526,awesome place i love going to nooks for trivia night the place is really spacious huge bar area i always order a craft beer lots to choose from i also get the burger quesadillas wings and a soup the bartenders are good about remembering me which is always a bonus it s a great little gem tucked away but close to home
5527,great bar abigail was very knowledgeable and friendly learned a bunch while having fun and a perfectly balanced daiquiri the pot tenderloin was delicious and the service was excellent thank you to kyle for going to retrieve my gift bag from the swizzle stick hospitality at its best
5528,the scallops and broiled crab cakes are really good i rarely like seafood at diners but it s excellent here
5529,i totally love the steak eggs with the breakfast potatoes and melon mule the service was great and atmosphere was cozy
5530,no anchovies is a college staple that is everyone has come to know and love in tucson but is also a no brainer if you re on university and need a quick delicious slice to calm the nerves they have a nice selection of classic pizzas and some new school options like bbq chicken or buffalo and offer sandwiches and wings as well the service is fast and friendly they also offer a nice beer selection and full bar and is a cool place to visit to watch big games but beware it will be packed but what s a good game without some yelling my go to is a pepperoni and mushroom slices their pizza has nice crispy crust and tastes amazing i will always be back to enjoy a nice slice from no anchovies
5531,this was my first time here the coffee was spot on great job i had a vanilla latte made with almond milk they offer gluten free items this makes for a happy girls the peanut butter protein ball was delicious hip vibe artsy i will be back and with friends
5532,the food is fantastic fried avocado wedges were surprisingly good i m not a huge avocado fan my wife s burger double major was awesome the patties were bigger than the bun tons of flavor i got the lamb burger and it was great i had high expectations too they take reservations highly recommended parking is mall parking 3 if less than 3 hours on weekends i highly recommend it if you are in the mood for good burgers they have good selection of beers and wine they have shakes that supposedly really good but i went with beer instead they will let you sample draft beers it s casual dress and whole family can enjoy many children were there
5533,the food is really good the service is less than average i felt very rushed unimportant and cheated was shocked that the waitress withheld my coins when she gave me my change do they withhold change from all of their customers very disappointed would she have done that to a well known food critic will probably go back one more time eventually but will have lots of change with me to pay the exact amount when it came time to give her tip i applied the coins she withheld from me they became part of her tip also her tip dropped from my standard 25 to 15 flabbergasted
5534,during certain hours of the day the lines at this post office will rival any local government office dmv hands down what keeps me coming back to this particular post office is the customer service here the workers have been nothing but helpful and polite to me when i ve had issues with my mail which has been rare the postal workers have worked to get a honest answer for me and the one time the mail went missing it was due to a temporary worker and not the regular workers i really enjoy going to the post office when i have to but when i know the line is going to be out of the door i keep my phone on to check all of my email
5535,came in just a few minutes ago looking for some crafting supplies and a porcelain tile for the wife chris over in lumber by the cutting station was extremely informative and helpful and funny he definitely gave top notch customer service afterwards amber one of the self check out clerks was awesome and friendly and had a smile on her face i cannot remember the name of the other clerk she was with but she was the same highly recommend this location

5539,amazing food and great prices we eat here at least once a week chow mei fun is amazing but so is the sushi they also don t mind customizing your order if you like it spicy it prefer it more on the savory side my wife had the volcano roll and wasn t disappointed
5540,for those of you who have gave this restaurant a 3 5 rating shame on you now that we ve got that out of the way let me begin by saying this place was awesome the beignets made my breakfast amazing fluffy dough with a good consistency i m from hawaii where we have what s called a malasada these two are very similar pastries it brings me to deep sadness that beignets may have just won my heart over i really recommend that you consider just buying a single beignet per person these are very filling and if you ve already ate your amazing meal you may not have enough space in your stomach to fit it in take a break finish a cigarette for those smokers and return for a delicious beignet so as i leave nola with great memories and experiences i can gladly say beignet done that
5541,great place a few different bar areas cool sports pics on the walls loved that the bathrooms were central and clean good food decent service at the bar very cool place before a concert
5542,theres three different sections to this place a pastry section with tables a restaurant portion and all the way to the back is an indoor fireplace seating area where i m currently writing this review i came here around 3 00 pm where i ordered some pastries and a sandwich to snack on i would highly recommend their flan patissier 3 5 and kafta kabab 12 you can tell their pastries are skillfully made by the amount of layering in their crust it makes the outer layer of the flan crispy and very fluffy the inner flan filling was delicious not overly sweet and had a natural subtle taste of lemon to it i only wish i ordered tea or coffee to go with it the kabab wrap consisted of a juicy kabob w herbs long strip of fries hummus red onions and some other greens one of the best wraps i ve ever had all in all i d say this place is seriously a hidden gem for authentic middle eastern food i always wonder why center city can t have more places like this i ll definitely be coming back for dinner or just to try out more of their pastries
5543,always so fresh fast and consistent everything on the menu is incredible great service every single time too the establishment is always extremely clean as well it really is a gem tucked away in that strip mall they even have a rewards card for those who eat there as much as i do really great place kudos to the owners great stuff

5547,best coffee in the city the staff is super friendly the food is amazing great prices and relax environment
5548,run to this place and get your free shot check in offer even though it was jam packed with few seats open it was still easy to find street parking there are many tables outside for enjoying the weather and plenty inside for those inclement days we tried a hot cinnamon roll and it was gooey and delicious the frosting was a bit lemony which really brightened the flavor up i was in love with my triple shot latte everything about coffeebar was charming and delicious
5549,if i could give this place 10 stars i would best chicken and biscuits i ve had words can t even describe this place blows popeyes out the water hands down the fish and all the sauces were also soooo good we went here several nights for some late night eats despite a full day of eating at actual restaurants lol we just had to end our day with some of those honey butter biscuits we even went one more time to get biscuits to take on the flight with us home i need a willies in my town asap

5562,so nick was our driver he is thee best omg we had so much fun i at first thought this would be like a cycling class at the gym because of course after sitting on a bike seat for so long begins to hurt but the liquor was flowing so i didn t think about it nick was so much fun he gave us the aux cord and let us dj he even danced and rapped which blew us away he helped make our ride a good time i will be doing this again

5566,omg so good the uber driver from the airport said hattie s bs was good but touristy but that he personally goes to edley s near his home at one point a friend requested checking out 12 south and there was edley s there was a wait sure but not out the door at that time between the 6 of us we must have ordered all the meats and sides except the collards and brisket which were both out so we ll have to return delicious every item was delicious tender smokey deliciousness there was no single favorite among them so you just might have to try them all even the grits were interesting and yummy not plain best hot chicken i had in nashville and i tried it 4 times over 4 days in nashville which is not enough time washed it all down with a bloody mary that might be the best one i ve ever had spicy with plenty of vegetables string on a stick to decorate provide vitamins okra i hope you ll read this review and try it best thing on 12 south literally
5567,just ok you would think with a name like this you would be about to get some authentic creole food in nola i had the gumbo and the crab claws the gumbo wasn t hot and crab claws barely had any meat on them but the taste of everything was good eh i probably wouldn t go back
5568,you would never even know it s vegan they are absolutely delicious with just the right amount of sweet and creaminess
5569,this is absolutely going to be a must stop at anytime i am in nashville so cool great drinks and an awesome outdoor seating area definitely make sure you take time to visit read the entire drink menu they have history and information on each drink they list 10 10 for service as well as small bites of food do yourself a favor order the daiquiri shown in the photo banana banana and the pina colada
5570,jean is as good as it gets she is one of a kind who really cares that you think your hair looks great it has been a long time since i found a stylist that made me happy i had come to them if i could give her ten stars here i would

5572,booked this tour through groupon took this tour on the first day which i highly recommend that you do learned some very interesting history and received tips on how to tour the french quarter like a local best tip go to rouse s supermarket for crystal s hot sauce and slap you mama seasoning save
5573,i love new orleans version of bbq shrimp so i came here specifically for that since the reviews i ve read pointed me here the only time i could fit it into my schedule was for lunch which worked out great since it was on both lunch and dinner menus had a nice 1 50 bloody mary as a lunch special too small but good i started off with the gumbo ya ya which was very flavorful and had a nice spiciness to it some other places don t have that kick i like in a gumbo it s just enough to let you know it s there my favorite of the trip out of 3 places my wife ordered the veal milanese which was super tender and had a nice crust on it very flavorful as well as we always try each other s food after the waiter put on my bib i was able to get to the main event the barbecue shrimp were delicious they were a little slippery to get the heads and shells off yes they re shell on but using two hands got the job done had to dip the shrimp in the sauce after peeling and my hands were getting messy the bread in the sauce is also quite delicious i preferred the bread they brought before the meal in the juices over the softer bread they brought with the meal as i was finishing they brought over a hot wet towel with lemons so i could clean myself up that was a nice touch that i wasn t expecting my wife ordered the pecan pie for dessert and it was also pretty tasty the inside was dark and sweet and the pecans had a nice soft crunch another good dessert the service was good as well as the gentlemen tending to our table were always nearby if we needed anything it s not far from bourbon st and i recommend stopping in if your willing to rip apart shrimp to eat them if i had one request it would be to have an option of getting shrimp already shelled tail on is fine would be much cleaner to eat
5574,this is the best place the family that owns this is so awesome and the food is incredible i m vegan and my family is not but we both had the best thai food we ve ever had i can t stop craving their tom yum soup
5575,i ve been here many times for lunch my dad and i both really like the food service is friendly attentive and efficient and it s a good spot for a lunch if you are taking a break from work my go to is the veggie burger and fries yummy although i ve also enjoyed the grilled cheese also my dad likes the curried chicken salad and the burger
5576,great spot for appetizers and beer over 30 beers on tap the newest menu items rueben and patty melt were awesome the dry rub ribs were tasty and spices were delicious without burn wednesday is live music night so check it out

5579,we ate here a few weeks ago i am so happy to have such a good sushi restaurant so close to our house now the food was great and the service was perfect
5580,ordered to go twice food was always ready quick and hot love their fries good food and great prices for what you get
5581,this is the best restaurant in town their italian food is awesome my friend went for the steak and said it was the best he ever tasted the service was just as good yes it s pricey but it s well worth it we will be back here for sure in the near future one of the best ideas we had in a long time
5582,wait a bit for seats on a saturday very roomy and trendy decor stuffed french toast is so good egg benedict was on point waiters are very busy and not as attentive will come back to try something else for sure
5583,mood caf is the place for proper chaat and lassi in philly and this is coming from legit pakistani people to top off their menu the service is amazing the owner is always here super friendly and if you re nice will top off your order with a freebie be nice keep the mood light the rose lassi is ahhhhhhmazing they re opening s sit down pakistani restaurant next month called langar
5584,clean professional and friendly prices as expected i ended up here because every other place i went opens at 10 they open at 930 i was driving around since 9 they start to get busy around 10 it seems everyone wants a pedicure i was there for a manicure their techniques seem a little outdated i look at pinterest for inspiration i m not sure they could do those designs like glitter for example my former place had jars and jars of glitter it was all different kinds that they applied w a small fluffy brush but the final work was acceptable i ll keep looking for a design place but i would definitely come back here too got a 90 second massage w manicure that was great too
5585,best place to grab a bite to eat in smyrna food is always wonderful and the owner is just awesome recommend that everyone gives it a shot the burger with egg and bacon on top is amazing
5586,i was amazed by every dish and so was my entire party this is real home town momma in the kitchen cookin up some dem some vittles great
5587,very much enjoyed this meal the restaurant is nice and spacious great views and on golf course the appetizers were good not great we got the pull away rolls which were very nice when they came out warm the spinach artichoke dip was also good a little different than you get at most places the burger was excellent i built my own with pretzel bun bacon onions and mushrooms the fries and the onion rings were terrific the cookie skillet was a very nice ending great cookie it was my birthday and the server took a polaroid and gave it to us in a nice card it was a nice touch
5588,this location is by far the best of all the caf du monde i ve tried during my visit in nola the beignets are consistently not oily and freshly cooked whenever we came here been in this location 3 times in 6 days back in dec 2017 what s more there ice mocha and cafe mocha are also really good it s not too sweet and works well with the beignets wish they would open a location in socal
5589,i have had lunch at cool springs brewery one day a week each of the last six weeks every week i order something different i haven t been disappointed yet the service and the atmosphere are great it s always a pleasant experience
5590,legitimately the most reliable and inexpensive mexican food i ve ever come across great meat cheese guac etc i wish i could be their brand ambassador and run their twitter account i ve moved to nyc now but i would travel across boroughs to eat here if they had a new york location
5591,i m really not sure why this place had such a long wait on a thursday morning 45 min because it s really quite average once we were seated the service was incredibly slow i think we waited 15 minutes for ice water our waitress was pretty inattentive i had the hot mess for brunch which was pretty good but definitely not worth the wait the lavender honey latte was good but again took forever to arrive the barista must have been harvesting the beans in the back i asked for half the usual amount of honey and my waitress s response was i ll try not sure how you couldn t be successful in that as honey moves pretty slowly just like this waitress my friend had the chicken and waffles she said the chicken was dry but the waffle was good on the plus side the ambiance is pretty cool but i think the restaurant is just too large for the number of waitstaff they have overall would not come back
5592,what can you say this place that hasn t already been said seeing how it s been around forever food is just eclectic and well prepared the turtle soup i highly recommend and if you have the super lucky chance of visiting during restaurant week yeah that s what i said do it no way are you getting out of here under 50 60 a person even with the high price tag it is well worth it fresh ingredients and very friendly and interactive staff you can t help live this place when your done the evening is far from over take a stroll upstairs to the sance room and check out the table they have set for the in house ghost so you got that to look forward to a possible ghost sighting eat drink tell,ok we all know i dig donuts a lot we walked by this place on the way to lunch and i told the group uh that is happening you walk in and the case of massive donuts is front and well more right center but you get what i m saying the flavors are not extreme which is nice to see sometimes you don t want a sriracha like donut now a banana pudding donut we all need that i mean it s has fruit so it s like a healthy donut that thing was filled to the brim with banana puddingy goodness that was oozing out the side of yeah not a donut for the faint of heart you gots to be ready with these bad boys and i was once again not a coffee guy but my wife loves nitro infused coffee which they have so they got that going for them if you have the opportunity to go to nola take the hop on hop off to magazine st and indulge yourself and then walk it off it s a big donut eat drink tell
5593,so glad to see this restaurant open a welcome addition to the northwest tucson oro valley marana area and a unique cuisine to boot we stopped for lunch the menu is impressive the service was quite good the food excellent be sure to ask about the plate that arrives shortly after you sit down i looked it up after getting home and will definitely make better use of the raw onion fresh greens and butter on our next visit the butter goes on the hot basmati rice you eat bites of the onion and greens with other hot foods or you can make a little sandwich on naan butter onion and greens which is what i did
5594,ignore all the negative reviews especially from the people who haven t actually eaten there my husband and i ate there with two other couples and stopped by an hour early to drop off our byob and they were happy to hold our wine and beer while we walked around town the service was friendly and attentive and the food was so good we shared many appetizers and a couple of entrees and our bill was still under 100 for 6 people we will definitely be back and i would highly recommend
5595,can t recommend this place enough amazing space super cool owners staff and best of all the coffee is amazing get the chocolate torte affogato
5596,absolutely amazing food atmosphere everything was wonderful i m very happy they allow use of no wait app that shortened the amount of wait time for the table the biscuits were so light and tasted like my momma made them one of the stand outs was the fried green tomatoes i would trade my right arm for these very tasty and the portions were generous they have worked their way into my heart i will be going back to them anytime i m in new orleans
5597,highly recommend village bakehouse for anyone planning their wedding we ordered 5 dozen cupcakes and a small 6 inch for our reception and they were delicious we got a lot of compliments from guests surprising to me carrot was the most popular flavor some said the best carrot cake they ever had you won t be disappointed
5598,i was very excited when my brother and his family took me here as i always love to compare southern california mexican food to arizona as it s a close competition this rating leans more to 3 5 than 3 but had to round down because the food was more dissapointing than the absolute amazing service don t get me wrong the food isn t bad and to find a spot that does menudo on a weekday almost unheard of but here el sur does with a blanco and a regular version where this was dissapointing was there were was waaaaaaay more hominy garbanzo beans than actual tripe this is sad because the flavor was good just an excessive amount of hominy so if you re ok with that kind of ratio please try because mama in the back makes it right i also got a cabeza quesadilla the meat was flavored wrll but a little on the dry side which is awkward for such a fatty piece of meat i did really enjoy it though the service was amaaaazing though the waitress and waiter we re heavily attentive super nice it really doesn t get much better than that maybe it s my comparison to socal spots that makes this place 3 stars instead of 4 but unfortunately that s the truth of things and el sur was put at that disadvantage would i return you bet i want to check out the rest of their caldos and dinner plates my brother said the asada plate was delicious i may want to try a flauta or something hopefully next time they change my mind especially with pozole only on wednesday
5599,great place for a quick breakfast if you re staying on canal do yourself a favor and walk down to this place the staff is friendly and the serving sizes are hangover friendly
5600,i give this a solid 4 maybe a 4 5 service is always spot on and how can you go wrong with chicken and waffles i do like this lunch soot and strongly recommend
5601,i loved their french toast flight so i got to try all three of them my favorite was the valentine the only thing i wish was different was their portion size i had enough for me but the guys in our group were still not full afterwards overall great environment and quality food
5602,i stopped to get a full detail done and i even added on some extras and the price was still amazing i got in immediately and by the time i took my child to the play park for an hour and came back it was done shiny and ready to go five stars all the way around
5603,after being unable to find any decent rated plumbers in the area i found ray on google i called the office and explained to the receptionist what the issue was and she was super helpful she mentioned that due to the somewhat complex nature of my call she ll send me the owner so he diagnose the issue himself ray arrived on time on his appointment time and he was thorough friendly and knew what he was talking about not only was he able to identify the issue right away he fixed it immediately as well 5 stars
5604,lawn love lawn care received a four because my initial booking wasn t correct but robert who was my lawn pro was amazing he was flexible friendly and professional he even returned to warn me about the pesticides and my pets he was understanding because of the scheduling mix up and is willing to return next day i would use lawn love just for their lawn pro the customer service i dealt with the scheduling mix up was awesome i felt they tried their hardest to assist me
5605,they always have everything and anything i can think of for a decent price coupons everyday and besides one or two incidents most of the staff is very helpful
5606,we really enjoyed our experience here the past week they expanded their hours from just lunch to dinner they are new so still on the preview menu but the full menu should launch soon this place was developed by a james beard nominee so i had high expectations and they didn t disappoint we had the handmade chips and guacamole big serving so be prepared my favorites were the chicken tikka taco and the idaho spud potato my husband liked the mushroom bacon taco and the chef s taco of the night which was a meatball taco it was a little bit more than we are used to spending 4 5 per taco but i would say that is fair for the quality that you get this was definitely our 1 pick of the new taco places that just opened up in town
5607,i had some electrical work done a new garbage disposal installed and my pella glass storm door which was locked in the closed position repaired lynch maintenance service did an amazing job on time professional and courteous i will definitely use them again
5608,update the manager invited me back to the mason jar for a complimentary meal he explained correctly that i had received the wrong order when i came in the first time for the free meal i chose the chicken parmesan bites with fries which is a small plate the fries were awesome and there were so many chicken bites that i had to take a go box home i am willing to return to the mason jar for another try the manager nakia went out of his way to correct the mistake and in today s food industry that s rare
5609,i was in the mood for beef the tenderness and flavor of the meat was excellent service was great too in a city of great food you always have so many choices i would choose this restaurant again
5610,food delish large menu friendly service huge portions what else could you be looking for
5611,delicious flavors are fresh not the run of the mill selections and the drinks are creative as well clean well run and attentive even for a holiday evening the staff from the moment we walked in were friendly and helpful and knowledgeable about food sensitivities we ate a decent amount of food but didn t feel weighed down we started with the traditional guacamole and queso with chorizo salsa has a hint of chipotle which lends a subtle smokiness chips are a little thicker and were pleased to find them not at all greasy our party enjoyed the chicken enchiladas tacos carnitas corn esquisites black beans and rice and sweet plantains a frozen mango margarita and a traditional margarita on the rocks with pineapple and habanero misses the 5th star because although the margarita was good it didn t really have any kick but definitely would go back and try a frozen margarita
5612,this thrift store is huge the furniture is often well priced and there is a wide selection of clothes dishes books decor kids toys movies etc
5613,i ve been a member here since 2009 i ve checked out other gyms in the area but always end up coming back i have no real complaints about the place it s cleaner than most the equipment is spaced out and the weights are usually in the right place unlike other locations it does get a bit busy around 4 8pm but their recently extended hours have helped a lot the only complaint i have isn t about the gym itself it s the area it s in which has gone further and further downhill over the years but that s pretty much all of philly
5614,my all time favorite ice cream shop every flavor i have ever had has been amazing sometimes i love it so much that i just want it in shake form so i have less work to consume haha i try to get a new flavor every time i go but do try the lavender honey flavor especially if you are stressed it really relaxes you and you sleep so well
5615,we ve been here several times over the years mostly notably for gencon and various home shows this space is huge and i m not just talking about the various rooms even the halls to get around are huge the convention center has always seemed clean to us when we re there for an event even the bathrooms one big plus is the location because it s in the heart of downtown you can easily walk out the doors to enjoy real food i ve been to other convention centers for events in other cities and states where they are stuck out in the middle of nowhere so you re stuck eating stale yellow corn chips with a side of melted plastic cheese in indianapolis we re lucky we can walk out the door and down the street to enjoy a variety of restaurants with real food
5616,the prices were reasonable and the food was wonderful the sushi was uber fresh the place is brand new and the staff is super friendly if you re hungry for sushi it s definitely a great choice
5617,love this place my nails always are beautifully done and the prices are great also like that i can walk in and not call my nail technician was also very communicative about what i wanted very friendly and made me feel comfortable will definitely be back
5618,dint like the food much left a lot chai was good servers were good but despite of requesting for onions 3 times we didn t it till the end
5619,went to sassafras last sunday for brunch we got there a little after 10 30 am and were seated right away by the time we left the place was full of after church diners i had a basic breakfast of eggs grits and hot sausage which they make in house and it was delicious my partner had a hot sausage omelet that was excellent great food that seemed like home made at a good price in a relaxing atmosphere the service was terrific our server akilah was attentive and friendly will definitely go back next time we re in the area
5620,fabulous burritos the california burrito is one of the most delicious things i ve ever eaten and all of their food is very reasonably priced their green salsa is also delicious and i love that there is a salsa bar so you can take as much or as little as you want the staff is friendly and they make your food very quickly they also have strawberry fanta in the soda fountain which is amazing i am a big fan of the strawberry but you can usually only get orange at restaurants just a little cherry or strawberry on top of an already great food experience the only bad thing i ve gotten there was the nachos they weren t gross but it was just shredded cheese melted on top of store bought tortilla chips you could easily make that at home so not worth the money otherwise everything i ve had there is a great value
5621,wonderful art deco decor the decor had me sold on the place before we even ordered everything from the martini mississippi mudslide to dessert banana bourbon was delicious i ordered roast beef and the pickle soup both were very good and i would order it again waiter was very friendly will have to stop back next time we are in town
5622,this place was excellent a real southern gem in the middle of philly got there right after 10 on labor day and were seated in 10 minutes or less the place was constantly hopping with lots of families with little kids i got 2 75 bottomless coffee there was a pourer or cream on the table not just milk which was unexpected and great and the 13 honey s platter two eggs got mine fried and runny and they came as ordered potatoes i got the home fries which were really well seasoned and had a little kick and a great texture meat i got the veggie sausage which was good and three pancakes fluffy and good but stick to butter or jam if you re one of those people who has to have real maple syrup kinda wish we d come here on our first day in town instead of sabrina s
5623,this was one of the best meals i ve had in new orleans which considering most things in this town are covered in butter and deliciousness says a lot in particular i usually dislike bbq shrimp but that dish is really fantastic here the sauce is unreal and there is definitely a reason it s their signature dish
5624,this little gem still never ceases to impress we love coming here for the delicious thai flavors the friendliness and hospitality of the owner and staff bella is our usual server and she is awesome the food portions are generous for items like thai fried rice pad thai and other servings the curry items come with one portion of white rice we ve tried a bunch of different options which are all great our favorites are noodle soup panang curry thai legacy fried rice and pad thai veggie spring rolls are amazing we order from the vegan menu but we have also brought plenty of family member who are not vegan and they order from regular menu and enjoy the food just as much you just can t go wrong here this is the thai place to eat the tables are always beautifully decorated with real flowers which reminds us so much of our trip to thailand
5625,this place is top notch every time i go the food is amazing and service is great
5626,the place has great prices and if you like wings they are very good its a little dark but if you want a quiet place in the afternoon that is quiet and a little dark like a cave to get out of the sun when it is too hot this place will be just right for you plenty of tv s
5627,great place to rent a car the whole staff makes it a quick and pleasant experience best value on rentals
5628,omg this place is the shit like it s not only easily the best caribbean jamaican food i ve ever had but some of the best food in general i ve ever had incredibly flavorful spicy but won t melt your eye out huge portion for 10 bucks jerk chicken white rice with some bean gravy mac and cheese 10 bucks for 2 pounds of heaven come here
5629,authentic food that is often hard to find staff is friendly this is my go to place in the city
5630,great indian food always cooked fresh and to perfection the owner and his wife are so sweet and will accommodate in any way they can amazing lunch buffet for 9 99
5631,the food is quality but not very flavorful they had really unique dishes that are both decadent and tasty but if you want something super seasoned and flavorful this might not be the place for you the giant fish tank that you in front of while you eat is so breathtaking and unique the food came out fast and hot and it was good just not as flavorful as i prefer the prices were also pretty high but worth it if you re wanting to splurge on a fancy beachy meal
5632,from the starter to dessert it was delicious and service was great our waiter tim was amazing ask for him
5633,i assumed brews meant beer once i got over that i appreciated the donuts i mean donuts and beer would seriously be the greatest pairing since pb j my friends assumed beer also we came for beer and stayed for the donuts which were amazing and giant but it wasn t memorable amazing it was ohh these are giant donuts they made in front of me me and friends ordered different ones so we could sample each others the establishment was cool but again i repeat there are no beers just nice people and donuts
5634,we stayed at the holiday inn right next to north 30th and decided to head there for dinner after a long day at busch gardens great sports bar very clean lots of tvs showing all different sporting events staff was very friendly and we had nice quick service food was good and we were all very happy we hung around for a bit after finishing our meal and had a few drinks which were well made and much needed after dealing with our kids at the theme park all day we had our own liquor in our hotel room however we enjoyed the setting here and did not want to go back to our room just yet so it was nice to sit and enjoy our drinks without feeling rushed to leave will definitely eat here again the next time we are in tampa
5635,living on mesa this is our to go place for sushi great service fast and friendly staff the rainbow roll is bomb
5636,bread pudding ahhhh mazing the best i ve ever had also had the eggplant lasagna and greens very good and super filling
5637,i stayed at this location the week of july 4th the visit was amazing everything in the hotel was nice and clean we were promptly greeted and assisted with our luggage upon arrival the room was very nice with a bay view and we could also see the pool area this room had one of the largest televisions that i have ever seen in a hotel room i didn t order any food or drinks from the hotel on this stay so i can t comment on that part of the service the environment is very family friendly and it is so easy to take a drive to clearwater beach my only complaint about the hotel is that the cleaning staff will only leave 2 washcloths in your room regardless of how many guests you have it was 3 of us and i would have to call each day to get an additional washcloth i had also requested that the sheets be changed one day by leaving a note with a 5 the note and money was gone but the same old sheets were on the bed other than that my experience was nothing short of amazing
5638,we had the spicy miso ramen it was the best ramen i ve ever had by far i will be coming here every time i m in tucson
5639,best burger in town it s got short rib in it great friendly service and live music a new favorite spot
5640,fantastic dentist dr jaffari team treat you like a person not just a patient but are so comprehensive in their treatment cannot speak highly enough
5641,i don t review places often as you can see but i couldn t skip this one here s the deal food is fabulous drinks delicious live music is excellent if you go i highly recommend the pork belly and the lamb sliders our service was horrendous hence the three stars it s kind of like a tapas place in that you get a bunch of plates to share amongst your table we were sitting there for 45 minutes without food that had been ordered eventually i had to inquire about the issue server came back and said that the order never got put in without taking any ownership of the mistake or apologizing i was certain some consideration would have been taken when the bill came but it was 100 full price when the server gave us the bill her comment was at least you had some romantic time together between courses awful way to close the night considering there are plenty of ways to spend time in new orleans that are more romantic than sitting in a restaurant waiting on food and feeling like you ve been forgotten i d say go but stay on top of the service
5642,started with the octopus appetizer it was amazing i could of had three of these and made it a dinner my friend had the kapama dinner and i had the shrimp poseidon i was a tad bit disappointed in the size of the shrimp dinner as well as the presentation it looked like a cross between an appetizer and a dinner we had baklava and kantaifi for dessert i wasn t really feeling the shredded phyllo dough on my dessert should have stuck with the tried and true baklava greek coffee was amazing definitely will be back here in the summer to sit outside and people watch while dining on a grilled chicken gyro
5643,i gave been going to dr youngblood for several years he s the most gentle dentist i have ever been to great hygienist too nice office staff plus dr youngblood is an honest person i asked him about an expensive procedure that i thought might be good for me but dr youngblood was honest about it s effectiveness for me not sure other dentists would be that honest great experience
5644,i love this place so much super cool place if you just want to work draw or catch up with a friend i love the fresh feeling you get when u walk in i d suggest getting the basimo sunrise with silver dollar pancakes
5645,went for restaurant week on 1 19 18 very good food and great staff everything we tried was great only negative is the espresso machine was broke no big deal though
5646,i was so surprised at how much i got back given that i graduated almost 3 5 years ago i went in close to closing and the lady who helped me was super sweet and nice very efficient basically scanned my stack of about 10 books and told me how much each was worth walked out a happy customer or i guess seller haha
5647,we recently spent our 19th wedding anniversary at the rebrand fess parker red lion doubletree hotel it was a staycation and we were only there for 1 night we d stayed here before when it was a doubletree so we knew what to expect when they learned it was are in a versary they upgraded our room and shortly after we received champagne and chocolate strawberries and a nice card from the concierge it was a wonderful and thoughtful gesture and greatly appreciated helping to make our stay and our day special the rooms are a little dated but the beds are comfortable with great pillows and at the end of the day you are 200 yards from the ocean in a beautiful city and if you can t appreciate that center yourself and put yourself in the right frame of mind
5648,we were in town for a couple days during our vacation and went here based on the almost 5 star rating on yelp tacos were alright and i would say pretty authentic it was ok just felt like i ve had better back home in homestead fl
5649,awesome staff yummy food great beer releases of beer every thursday at 6pm has some board and card games seats and couches outside pet friendly patio
5650,my barber is steven g and my review will be reflective of my experience with him my family and i have been using him for a few years now with satisfactory results my husband went to the same barber for almost 20 years and only switched allegience after seeing steven s cuts on both my son and me steven is meticulous and takes a great deal of pride in his craft he s skilled with various hair textures as well he s never late to his appointments and does his best to accommodate most schedules we have a standing appointment to insure we get our preferred time slots
5651,update my wife s ring has been delivered and picked up very apologetically we were offered a resolution that works for us to a point therefore i ve changed my rate from one star to 3 in the future we will be very cautious originally my wife and i loved and i mean loved this place we both got our rings here and the experience was just perfect now fast forward about three months to my wife s rings broke she had one of the disney collection rings and the diamond and rose setting fell off we rushed right in on 12 22 2017 to drop it off and get it repaired understandably with it being the holiday they said it may take about three weeks three weeks goes by and no phone call so we stop in and see how things are going well nothing happened and we were told sorry over and over and they d get right on it and it would take a couple more weeks three more weeks goes by we stop in again still no replacement still no answers but we got another apology which doesn t do any good that brings us to about the beginning of february just when i m talking to my wife about how crazy this whole situation is she gets a call it s 2 14 2018 and her ring will be in that week finally the saga is over or so we think today is 3 3 2018 and finally i ve had enough so i call the person who answers the phone tells me it still isn t in and can they call me back because they are doing 6 things at once what about my one thing my fully paid for wedding ring that is in limbo now for almost 3 months i was offered a callback on monday or tuesday that is absolutely unacceptable so i demand a same day call back with some answers by the owner the truth for once or a refund so i can buy her something she can actually wear this experience has been absolutely horrible and there is no excuse that would make it any better it doesn t take 3 months to replace a ring there is absolutely no way
5652,after going to raijin for a while now its its legitimately one of my favorite places in town ive troed every kind of ramen and their bowls everything is tasty and the ramen is filling
5653,courtesy fast and accommodating staff the sushi and drinks was average to below average the karaoke room was terrific the bathrooms are not clean and that usually indicates the kitchen and bar are not clean
5654,the food at katie s was great it was a wonderful place for sunday brunch they had a diverse menu with tons of options which made it easy even for me to eat here gf and vegetarian i had the veggie omelette and hash browns and it was delicious a few too many onions in the omelette for my taste but it was still good there was a friendly casual atmosphere and nice staff would recommend,the swamp tour was a fun way to learn more about new orleans and some of its native critters our tour guide captain troy was very knowledgeable as well as personable and funny he knew some of the gators and pigs by name and they got up very close to the boat the only reason it is not 5 stars is the disorganized transportation we paid extra for the bus service and we stood on a street corner for about an hour waiting to be picked up and thebother passengers told us they had been driving in circles aside from the bus chaos this was a wonderful tour
5655,service is okay must stop for me and my shrimp and grits when in nola i love grits because of this place the little toasts were sooo good and nice lightly toasted
5656,a friend recommended me to check them out and it was totally worth they did a great job on my mercedes took them only a day and came out brand new also they were decently priced compared to every other body shop i got a quote from thanks guys
5657,i cannot say enough great things about this place wonderful customer service super fun games great drinks safe environment and an awesome place to take a date my husband and i love coming here we have brought several friends and they have all had blast i highly recommend this place for a fun time you won t be disappointed
5658,i ve heard that this is a great place to go with great food got there on a saturday afternoon and was seated outside sat for more than 10 mins without being acknowledged by a server so we went inside and sat at the bar they have happy hour deals 7 days a week on well drinks craft beer and wines and some food items so that s a plus the menu looked great and reasonably priced just tried the falafel and the hummus and pita on the happy hour menu and it was decent but some of the pita pieces were burned the bartender was excellent and very attentive the restaurant was full an intimate place with about 16 tables and a iong bar with tvs i am willing to try this place again for their food but was disappointed with the lack of service we received initially hoping the next time will be better
5659,excelente la comida las costillas ribs fueron deliciosas we will return the service was great too
5660,a resort style outdoor bar with a flavorful menu of fresh seafood great atmosphere and fun drinks to go around all that was missing was the sound of the ocean
5661,after planning to meet friends for brunch in indy we decided on milktooth the restaurant is smaller and they have many community tables we got there just at the right time for a saturday 10 30 am didn t have to wait for a table the menu is unique but for those brunchers who just enjoy simple eggs toast and bacon they ll make it i ordered a dutch baby with apples and the mocha the coffee was a good solid coffee i was underwhelmed by the dutch baby it was good but not great without the apples on top the pancake itself was very bland i didn t taste any extra seasoning i also felt that the 13 for the dutch baby was a little high having made a dutch baby myself and knowing the ingredients and how easy it is to make i didn t feel like the 13 was warranted our service was good and the atmosphere was unique the place gets very busy around 11 so be sure to plan ahead it was a neat brunch place and would be a great place to visit when the weather gets nicer as they have outdoor seating parking is limited in the parking lot but there was a lot of free parking on the street
5662,fun short trip to view port battlefield and city can be crowded so get in line early
5663,just average i gave it three because the staff were friendly and the place itself was interesting with the old decor and historic site marking the pasta tasted like it was from a box and not made fresh as i was expecting being the stores down the street were all selling fresh pasta and it being in the italian market the veal was too salty and chewy but the sauce had a nice light flavor to balance the dish in the end just disappointed in the overall quality as it does not fit the location in the italian market tasted more like italian food that i would get in the poconos or a small town in west virginia
5664,first time trying out this spot with 2 other fiends we got the all you can eat for 25 per person we got two rounds of sushi we came in on a monday around 7 30pm and we were the only ones there started to fill up by 8 30pm good for parties of 2 5 as he tables are smaller quality of fish was great everything tasted amazing i deducted one star because there was only one waiter and one sushi chef getting our food took painfully long as people started to come in if you re looking for a good deal and quality sushi this is the place be prepared to wait for your food though i ll be back
5665,i really liked the concept and the quality of service liked the sauces as well it would have been better if the food was more authentic miso soup the bean paste soup tasted more japanese than korean and the rice either it isn t korean or wasn t cooked right korean rice is sticky but the rice i was served was very dry
5666,hotel in a great location we rented a suite the week right before labor day this hotel is central to all the key sites to see its valet parking and its expensive but this is the prime area of philly so you have to be realistic of what you can expect room was very clean and the shower was phenomenal as it was a giant room shower tub service was superb in particular both the car valet as well as the doorman they helped to gather my stuff when i was leaving and were very astute strategic to stand in certain spots mind you i am a parent with 2 kids and so it is difficult to pack up a car trunk and seat belts kids and keep an eye on all your stuff at the same time both were strategic to do their jobs as doorman and car valet but also strategically stand in the right spots so that nobody could would potentially steal any bags walking by as i was getting the family tucked in and arranging the trunk thats trained skilled and a sign of service mentality ate the restaurant bar also it was okay nothing to rave about but not horrible either overall great stay at the hotel with excellent service
5667,the food here is so good they have a great patio and the staff is very attentive and professional we had lindsey from seattle as our server and she was awesome steak frites and eggs were amazing
5668,love this place so far i ve had three different barbers and each cut has been perfect never used a legit barber shop before and i couldn t be happier to have switched the fades are tight love the shape up barbers are all cool good barber shop talk sports on tv and not too pricey who could complain i usually go mid day during the week so not sure about normal wait times but i ve never had to wait great place
5669,back again and stopped by twice this week once again the food is excellent and the staff is very friendly rotisserie chicken is so easy to over cook and become dry but they bribe their chicken and it comes out moist everytime i order this dish every time i come here i also just tried the blackened ribeye and it was excellent as well this is why i eat here every trip i make to reno
5670,usual taco salad nice professional kids who work there they always take their coupons typically more than one at a time only issue is they discontinued the shrimp and they were delicious overall good eats lunch or dinner good customer service and awesome beverage selection keep up the good work guys
5671,good service rustic tucson feel to the atmosphere good amount of seating personally i don t think their entrees or most of their food is that great but their wings spinach artichoke dip and fries are awesome especially during their happy hour
5672,great vibe with super nice people lattes were crafted with care and were excellent they use buddy brew beans will stop by any time i m in the area
5673,best cheeseburger and sweet potato fries good service during a very busy sat night only down side was the strange bread pudding with mustard and banana creme not a fan
5674,i went marakkesh with my friend i am really amazed with the atmosphere and delicious moroccan food i live in ny buti never tasted such a good food the folks and personnel are really good and they love their work when i ate the chicken and lamb with my friend the degree of happiness was at the highest go there with a friend and share happiness by enjoying the food
5675,while visiting the beach we found this restaurant nearby the atmosphere was inviting and the colors really gave it a florida vibe it was busy during the lunch hour but wait times were minimal we asked to sit outside but the bugs were so bad we decided to move to the inside seating the staff was accommodating and very helpful the food was delicious and we got a lot for a good price we loved it so much we went back a second night will recommend this place and if in the area again will go back
5676,so glad to have this close to home aside from making great thai food it s an undercover gourmet restaurant all around great restaurant and experience with terrific service
5677,as hotel restaurants go this place was very satisfying for the 3 days that we stayed here at the blake hotel we ate breakfast came in for drinks for coffee and for appetizers pretty much everything that we ordered and tried was good i have to give a shout out for a few things that we indulged in one was the rum punch during happy hour which is only 5 they have great mozzarella sticks that come with a marinara sauce and a ranch sauce for dipping the gumbo though not outstanding was very good for breakfast one morning i got the 3 egg omelette and i chose to stuff it with andouille sausage and pepper jack cheese it was delicious the breakfast came with a side order of creamy grits and a biscuit
5678,great food couple of big screens with sports playing fast and attentive service cute waitresses
5679,my fiancee has to come here whenever are in town quick to get in for us the staff is all really nice which makes for a great atmosphere some of the typical semi bland buffet food is there i won t lie but i do love the fresh carved meat the brisket was really yummy if you like lots of choices i d say check it out
5680,by far the best sushi in south tampa especially the bronze pebble and i like that they offer all types and forms of sushi making it a very well rounded menu plus the urban ambiance gives the joint a nice modern twist great for lunch or dinner,i like the ice cream here bc it s really creative and pretty good but what really put me off was the smell it might just be me but i don t know it smells kind of dingy to me but it looks very clean so i was confused other than that this place is cute and i like the flavor options they have
5681,i absolutely love this place the atmosphere is very chill very cute great selection for salad toppings also great selection of unique dressings the veggies are always fresh and delicious i absolutely love their falafel i go at least once a week and would recommend it for anyone they variety can cater to anyone s wants
5682,such delicious food came with some friends and got to try a pretty good variety of stuff for burgers we had the walk of fame the prime degree and the semester at sea walk of fame has an egg on top semester at sea is a seared tuna burger prime degree is prime aged beef burger with bacon you really couldn t go wrong with any of them we started with the shishito peppers for an app wasn t a huge fan of them but it was more that i just got tired of eating a plate of fried blistered peppers we also had the beer cheese tots cucumber tomato salad and the pork belly mac and cheese tots were good but lets face it they re tater tots the salad was amazing its an asian flavored salad so it has the sweet vinegar taste i loved it the mac n cheese was delicious but it was inconsistent we had 3 bowls of it and all 3 were very different like goldilocks and the 3 bears one had way too much cheese one had none and the 3rd was perfect if they all came out like the 3rd option i d say its a no brainer but it just wasn t consistent i suppose its nice in the sense that it seemed like each bowl was made to order rather than having a huge vat of it that they scoop it out of repeatedly the service was phenomenal also overall it was awesome the burgers alone are worth the price of admission give it a try
5683,i was so hungry today and saw the sign for pho i live pho but i wanted to try an easier and faster dish since i had to get back to work quickly i ordered the grilled chieken vermacelli i asked for it with rice and extra spicy which is how i like it the lady was so nice and they had it ready to pick up in 15 minutes everyone in there was enjoying pho it looked so good i want to get that next time the chicken was delicious and so tender it was the same texture as pulled pork the rice was aldo very good on the bottom and it came with a side salad dob t let this place decieve you by its looks and location it was definitelt worth the short walk across the street and i will definitely be back
5684,food was ok wasabi potatoes had zero hint of wasabi and were quite bland oysters on the p o boy was mostly breading fries pickles were the best i ve ever had crisp and fantastic the waitress was prompt and very courteous i would have like to tip more but it was already included since we had a large party
5685,we are visiting from indiana for the month it was time for my daughter to go back to indiana and i discovered this place through yelp when we got to the three coins diner we thought oh my are we going to be safe in this neighborhood and what kind of food are we going to get we entered the restaurant and we were told to seat ourselves we looked at the menu and the prices were very reasonable we ordered our meals our meals were huge my daughter had french toast and fruit the fruit bowl was huge my son had the country fried steak and eggs i had 2 eggs 4 pieces of bacon and 2 pancakes the food was great and so was the waitress our waitress kept coming up and asking if we wanted anything else we haven t had service like that in a long time we will be coming back to this restaurant for sure
5686,the food was absolutely amazing the place was packed and we had to wait for about an hour so be ready for that however the wait was definitely worth it we were a party of 4 and everyone ordered something different pictures enclosed
5687,what an amazing place the walls alone make it a fascinating experience the sandwiches are just incredible i just loved the entire experience there was a line out the door but it moved very fast they do a great job very nice people
5688,zeko s is the best place to get a gyro or shawarma in the usf area for less than 10 you can get both your entree and fries or a drink the inside is fine not very comfortable but that s not a big deal it s located near busch gardens so it s probably pretty convenient for people staying at the hotels over there i definitely will go back here again
5689,i sat down and ordered a crown meant go to then added some wings and the olives the wings came out like real wings not the typical chicken wings at first i was like oh man but i tried them and then were actually some of the best crispy wings i have ever had simply awesome bar tender was relaxing and calm which help to set the vibe if you re just relaxing on vacation and looking for a chill place head here pretty cool relaxing spotx
5690,this place never fails me finally tried the pho burrito and all i can say is yesss i had the brisket phoritto and my son has the chicken phoritto it s made to order so it takes a few minutes but worth the wait the broth the wrap all good
5691,so before writing my review i read some of the 1 star reviews and oh wow what a good ironic laugh a guy from la saying a bartender rolled his eyes would it have been better if he told you about the script he was writing you are from la and nashville is a cash grab come on now i think you are just a bit jelly that the south has something this cool bitching about internet and a true desk i had no issues with the net but then again i was out enjoying the city not writing letters home to my mom oh and charger guy sth up we both know why you think housekeeping would still it and you suck know for my review i am about the furthest you can get from a hipster but i love the eclectic and creative approach this hotel has taken it is staffed with people that are both professional and yet seem like they would be great to sit and have a beer with no matter what hour room service was very quick and on point i am a member to most large hotel chains and would rather stay here than any of them i seriously suggest you check it out most important is sasha and what they do for animal rescue
5692,there is nothing better than an honest contractor jd fixed our garbage disposal in rapid fashion and his work was excellent he also gave his honest opinion on a problem we are having with our dishwasher i recommend his business and will always call jd first
5693,been fishing with hubbards for 5 6 years now and they continue to provide one of the best values when it comes to party boat fishing in the gulf if you wanna have a shot at some quality fish and not break the bank then try the 10 hour day trip the crew goes out of their way to keep you fishing and make you happy the 12 hour extreme is also a great way to go out and experience fishing deep water for big fish without breaking the bank paying for a private charter dylan hubbard is a true asset to the community and we are lucky to have hubbards marina around tight lines
5694,sociale very well might be my new favorite italian spot in tampa huge portions super quick turnaround after you order and quality wine the 7 sangiovese was great the build your own pasta lets you get a little creative and the mix and match meatball platter is a stand out that i haven t seen on any other menu highly recommend
5695,these guys are absolutely amazing being on a budget and a fun and reliable import that was in my price range proved to be a challenge i stopped by southampton to look at several cars i told collin the make and model i was seeking and no more than a week later he called with the perfect vehicle for me i m happy to say that it s been an amazing experience and anything that s come up has been handled promptly and professionally i highly recommend southampton imports collin iand his team are the best
5696,i love this restaurant one of the best in st louis small unassuming but comfortable and most importantly delicious food and great service i ve been several times in the past 4 months and it has been wonderful each time for all in my party my only wish is that they would be open a little longer on the weekends for brunch don t miss
5697,awesome service food is made quickly but accurately it is so fresh i just wish they delivered to me but it s good enough that i am willing to drive there to get it also try their day old bread for 50 it is a full baguette and makes great garlic bread to accompany your dinner
5698,fairly good the hype for korean fried chicken has finally made it to nashville haha with that being said if you want to try it this place will be the spot get your quick fix for korean style fried chicken they have marinated and fried style also they have variety of thai dishes and sushi owners are super friendly and very accomedating
5699,3 5 stars for poor service the food is relatively good especially the chicken chicken sandwich and chicken salads are damn good unfortunately at night the place seems to be run by kids they never answer phone orders and typically get your order wrong also much slower at night to get food out than during the day if you aren t going to take orders or care about your customers at night just close down after lunch 3 2 5 stars my brother says try the chopped cobb salad
5700,i scheduled my son s circumcision after being referred by our pediatrician day before we didn t get a confirmation call so i called to verify we still had the appt i had verified with my insurance that circumcision should be 0 cost to me when i walked into the office they stated i had to pay 655 before services i was in shock i called my insurance after we paid thankfully i had an hsa account that i had been saving for my own bills from the delivery the 0 was if it was done while in the hospital after delivery ok fine i checked my insurance app and it said i should ve only paid 555 57 and so when we went in for our follow up i asked when i d get the rest of the money back receptionist called over to billing and they said once my claim was processed now i work for this insurance company in the mcr dept not commercial side that processed my claim our app showed my claim was already processed the week before she then stated if when my claim finalized that they ll add a credit or send my money back onto the card which it was returned to my card later that month from a medical standpoint the doctor was wonderful the procedure went really well with no issues at all however from a new patient standpoint it might help if patients will need that much up front that they be made aware prior to appt to make sure they ll have the funds i thought i had all my part figured out by speaking with my insurance prior to appt but that s not the case needless to say i feel the office staff could ve done better confirming the appt advising of cost as we would ve been in a lot of trouble if i didn t have funds in my account
5701,okay grumpy pants reviewers below if you want stellar service don t go opening night we went second night and had excellent service and tasty food both the prime rib eggrolls and the crispy pork belly appetizers were delicious and my gold rush bulleit rye cocktail was tasty we live in the neighborhood and are grateful for another option with parking thank you chadds ford tavern well be back
5702,everyone was really nice and this restaurant was so cute loving the tin ceiling carved woodwork and floor tiles
5703,we love sabrina s always fresh always good her soups are incredible please make posole more often we also love that we can bring our own wine without a corkage fee we ve been both for lunch and dinner same menu for both
5704,everything about this was just alright the burger was meh not flavorful mac and cheese was fine in a mediocre fine kinda way not a good fine kinda way green beans were just okay i probably won t try this again
5705,milk honey was so good we were trying to get food at another place down the street but the line was around the block and our lyft driver mentioned this was an amazing spot for brunch we put our names on the list walked down to the gulch wings photo op area walked back had a cocktail at the bar and were seated pretty quickly our waiter i believe his name was lucas he had a sweet luke skywalker lightsaber tattoo was awesome friendly and made everything on the menu sound amazing i went a little nuts and ordered a biscuit and the lavender honey latte then we ordered a cinnamon roll for the table so by the time my chicken and waffles arrived i was already pushing maximum capacity everything was so delicious i only wish i had paced myself so i could have eaten more of my main dish also the decor is wicked cute
5706,cool little place that has amazing cookie dough it tastes just like real cookie dough but is made without eggs or dairy chocolate chips technically are handled with dairy they ll let you try whatever you want so have at it until you find what you like 1 scoop is more than enough you can get it in a cone or a cup just like ice cream it stays if you need to take it home for later or the next day love it staff is super welcoming and will tell you all about the flavors and process if you have questions
5707,let me start by saying that the food was was a solid 4stars portions as well i enjoyed my basil chicken while my date had peppered beef which was a tad bland for my liking the only reason for not giving this place 4 stars was the service we didnt receive our waters until the entrees came and the waitress was generally unattentive also a bit odd was that rice must me ordered as a side southeast asian food without rice never heard of sucha thing but everything considered it is worth a try
5708,after fourteen years in area this is still my favorite restaurant food is top notch mexican that complement there drinks service is always great
5709,great staff great rooms and great food we stay here every time we travel which is alot
5710,born and raised in philly went to have a sandwich after a few drinks listen to the other reviews yes customer service was whack cheesesteak was weak very dissapointed i will give them 3 stars but this is not a recommendation to say the least
5711,the nook is a good addition to the growing culture of indy my wife and i were pleasantly surprised and excited to try a new place the kombucha rita was a good way to start the evening it was a refreshing twist to a traditional margarita the bacon guacamole plate was very tasty also and probably my new favorite way to eat guacamole next i had the nook burger and my wife had the chicken strips which she was very excited about b c she never gets to eat things like this due to a gluten allergy the burger was one of the best i have had in a while and that is saying a lot because i am usually not a fan of gf burger buns the 100 grass fed beef was very lean and left you wanting more my wife was surprised at how well she liked the chicken tenders they had a crispy gf breading on them but she did say that as they cooled down the breading did get a little soggy on the inside but that is normal for gf breading overall we enjoyed nook and will be eating here again
5712,it s good but overpriced don t expect to get cooled off though its 90 degrees outside and probably 78 in here
5713,i had my first brazilian with tina and i cannot imagine it going any smoother literally and figuratively she has a very calming demeanor that made it as pleasant as possible will definitely be returning for her services in the future
5714,this place is so good seriously go here it s modern israeli food which is absolutely delicious and they have small plates that are perfect for sharing the deluxe hummus and the octopus are a must try also my fianc took me here on the night he proposed and there was some mishap with our table but the staff was so awesome and totally made it up to us we were able to dine in their private room downstairs which was so cozy and wonderful and they even comped part of our meal we ve taken out of town guests here as well and it s always a hit
5715,excellent service from celeste the bartender and staff really attentive ands made you feel welcome great advice on the nachos and dragoon the local tucson ipa celeste brought sexy back
5716,delicious pizza and open despite the construction buy a pizza for a delicious dinner and say hi to tony the gregarious owner
5717,this truck came to my place of work and i am so glad the mustard bbq sauce is great and goes great with the sausage which was cooked with a great crust and flavor the owner is very personable and makes all of his own sauces which are all delicious thanks and keep it up
5718,frank is so warm and lovely and funny he was dead on when it came to what was currently happening in my life and helped make sense of it and some outcomes he has such a gift and just made me feel validated in the feelings i was having he is so in tune and has a true gift highly recommend
5719,excellent selection of local and big name beers ordered seasonal craft beers both sours and appetizers service was great too thank jill
5720,stopped here before attending the flaming lips concert at the xcite center we really enjoyed the place it was little on the pricey side but the food was delicious our wait service was awesome the waiters really helped make our dining experience feel like a special one the lobster bisque is a must try so good the only setback is that you have to walk through the smoke filled casino to get inside it kind of kills some of the romance of a signature restaurant experience the decor could also be updated
5721,one of the coolest little bars the restaurant side was closed when i arrived but went into the bar side and the full kitchen was still open pizza was bomb and atmosphere really felt like an old nyc bar will def return
5722,i have been coming here for years and it only gets better every time i come here it s close to nashville and all the fun that city has to offer a great place for a vacation
5723,you can t beat the prices and the quality is pretty good during the daytime counter person is very pleasant and polite
5724,outstanding service and amazing food there are a lot of vegetarian options and their horchata is on point i enjoyed their music and decor it all made me feel like i was in mexico for a minute
5725,my favorite place for italian eats have been going for the past 10 years and have never left disappointed i recommend the steak bites with gorgonzola cheese dip appetizer and the cannelloni with rose sauce i usually prefer the lounge to the restaurant because it has a great laid back vibe awesome music excellent service and is generally not too busy oh and the lounge also has free popcorn and board games every night the jasper ave location pales in comparison so make sure to go to the south one also it s never a bad idea to go for the sunday pasta special that s a giant family style plate of 5 different pastas for about 13 per person of parties of 2 or more all the snaps for this place
5726,this was hands down one of the best restaurants i ve been to the hot chicken sandwich was amazing with a side of fried tomatoes it was delicious and our waitress was so nice and personable would definitely come back here the next time i m in tennessee oh and make sure you try there sweet tea it s some of the best
5727,this is my favorite restaurant in st pete at the moment the cocktails are creative and fantastic the food is wonderful i ve tried almost everything on the menu and am never disappointed i highly recommend the steak tartare to start the curry as the main and the espresso martini to drink
5728,great fast and friendly service wonderful food as well my wife and i came for brunch and would definitely come back
5729,i had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for a night and i was impressed the best thing about this property is the view from the room by far the best thing the hotel has to offer parking was extremely expensive at this hotel but it is expected i had one issue with the hotel when i arrived in my room as i was unpacking my things i noticed a urine smell coming from the restroom as i was headed to dinner i informed guest services of the awful smell when i arrive back to my room about 6 hours later the room still had a slight smell of urine i decided to just deal with it for the night instead of moving to another room or informing guest services since it was extremely late outside of this the hotel was nice would i stay here again probably not but hey the view is immaculate
5730,highly recommended best of its class excellent curated collection of mostly beautiful mexican furniture jewelry textiles artwork and clothing all with prices that are competitive anywhere in tucson there are many fine shops like this in tucson and we ve visited many of them but we continue to come back to que bonita the selection is large and diverse but without being overwhelming quality is consistently good inventory is dynamic always something new the proprietor is a lovely woman and is herself a joy to visit and speak with and when she is not there the other members of the staff are always helpful
5731,amazing breakfast little neighborhood dinner but a hundred times better than a fancy restaurant in the fq service was awesome and the food was phenomenal
5732,my bridesmaids and i all had our nails done here before my wedding there were enough people that they shut down the salon and we had a private party buff has an extensive selection of colors and a lovely staff my nails were perfect and my no chip manicure was in great shape even after two full weeks highly recommend
5733,me likely tim likey my friends likey already said d they have excellent old fashioneds
5734,we arrived before doors opened for a show and the venue bar had bogo draft beers which was awesome they have quick bar service and a taco stand inside in case you need a bite to eat we went to a pretty chill show but a small group of people decided this was a punk mosh pit kind of show they were moshing around throwing beer on people falling down etc security was nowhere to be found i tried talking to security and they were not interested in hearing from patrons pretty disappointing after we traveled 3 hours to attend aside from the vibe the sound service and bars were good
5735,went to delicia for devour tonight it was on point like it always is excellent service and food they were very busy but we only waited about ten minutes at the bar for a table once we sat down our guacamole appetizer came quickly our drinks came immediately after we finished our first round from the bar my husband ordered the bistec pobre and i got the aji de galluna so good
5736,hicimos el tour a honey island swamp y aunque era invierno y los cocodrilos que vimos no eran pequeos vale la pena 100 nuestro gua muy entretenido y nos mostr las bellezas del pantano creo que ahora me puedo declarar swamplover por suerte pudimos reservar online un poco antes de que partiera el tour y a los pocos minutos nos fueron a buscar al hotel en una van q te lleva hasta el bus definitivo en el camino puedes ver los alrededores de new orleans y ver algunos vestigios por donde pas katrina o algn otro de los huracanes que eligieron new orleans para su recorrido al llegar a honey island hay una zona de espera donde hay servicios asientos y una tienda de refrigerios y souvenirs donde haba un cocodrilo pequeito despus de un rato llamaron a nuestro grupo y nos dirigimos al pantano nuestro gua tena un acento muy local y era experto en el rea tena ese humor cido pero entretenido que nos sac a todos varias carcajadas durante el viaje era un da fri y bastante nublado por lo que las probabilidades de ver cocodrilos no eran tan altas pero con su ojo experto pudo encontrarlos el primero que vimos estaba escondido entre una especie de juncos y luego vimos dos ms flotando cerca de una orilla se vean tan tranquilos y simpticos que me arrepent de a ver probado antes fried alligators y decid no comerlos ms tambin vimos diferentes especies de pjaros como grullas y garzas simpticos mapaches que se acercaron rpidamente a los botes ya que saban que los guas les daran algn regalito para comer adems de los cerdos salvajes que podan identificar la comida que le tiraban en el agua rastrearla y comerla como si su nariz fuese una aspiradora de comida los rboles tambin tienen su magia algunos parecen que tuvieran barbas y otros en sus troncos albergan araas y culebras que a veces se dejan ver en fin la belleza del pantano en s ya hacen que valga la pena tu viaje y de seguro que vers ms de un animalito que te sorprender si bien quizs como nosotros tampoco vers grandes cocodrilos pero estoy segura de que tu viaje te encantar como a nosotros pd debo confesar que no me pude resistir y me llev un pequeo recuerdo que me acompaar en mis viajes pd2 instagram unachilenaarroundtheworld unachilenaennola
5737,great time went with my best friend and it was our first visit everything was delicious a lovely outing
5738,jazmine is a great place to come for chinese and sushi i am not a big sushi fan but started eating it slowly at jazmine get the reno and jazmine roll here super good and add jalapeos to spice it it for the main dishes chicken fried rice chicken chow mein and generals chicken place is big enough for big parties and small parking is plenty full great spot in south reno
5739,fantastic service food was great such a nice irish pub we felt like we were visiting ireland all over again
5740,this was my second visit to deja brew the first time which i didn t review was an enjoyable dinner while being entertained by katie g and the half macs they were excellent by the way at that visit i had the grilled chicken caesar salad and two glasses of wonderful cabernet sauvignon service was great ambiance superb this morning we tried deja for breakfast service was different we had to stand in line to order one person on cash register one making coffee one delivering meals to tables and it appeared only one person in the kitchen it seemed to me to be a slow and clunky way to do breakfast after we ordered we were given a table number thing which to our surprise didn t mean drinks were delivered they were called out from behind the coffee bar noisy atmosphere and senior hearing doesn t make this a good system my wife ordered a heated cinnamon roll and a side of bacon she declared the bacon excellent but the roll was delivered cold she s too polite to send it back i ordered the cheese bacon grits i love grits and have always eaten them creamy it seems deja serves them baked that was a surprise but even more surprising was that they were very good yes said very good overall i would give the evening meal and service 5 stars and the breakfast 3 except for the cold cinnamon roll all the food was very good and wait staff polite
5741,i saw that the average was 2 1 2 stars and almost decided that i didn t have to leave a review because that is about what i was going to leave the restaurant is about middle of the road good job fellow reviewers i decided to leave three stars because our waitress was excellent my fried chicken salad was a mini portion expensive and not that tasty i won t likely go back to this location
5742,a last minute impromptu stop here turned out to be a life changing experience the cases are filled with tempting treats including cupcakes cakes pastries cookies and more we ordered a sugar cookie a scone a cupcake a blondie and a meringue cookie the sugar cookie was in the shape of a unicorn and tasted delightfully buttery and not too sweet the scone was packed with dried fruit and had just the right amount of crispness and richness the cupcake was a rendition of hot chocolate their flavors range from ordinary to quirky to truly original the frosting actually tasted like a steaming mug of hot chocolate while being light and fluffy at the same time the cake was one of the best cupcakes i ve ever tasted super light and yet very chocolatey i don t find cupcakes i like very often as i find most of them to be sickeningly sweet chemical laden or just lacking in flavor and texture this one was truly a standout and i enjoyed every bite i gave the lime cheesecake blondie to a friend and will inquire about its merits but based on everything else we sampled my guess is that it is on par the final selection a purple and blue swirled meringue cookie appropriately called unicorn poop was exactly right even though i m hardly ever in that neighborhood i was so pleased with the quality of the food and the adorable storefront that i will make an effort to return hopefully time and time again highly recommend
5743,emily made this experience amazing as we walked in we noticed how clean the place is it didn t smell unpleasant at all no trash anywhere and dust free emily greeted us in a friendly and inviting manner and took our order i noticed the crepes iron and asked about it it s clear she knows what she is doing as she was trying a new recipe the crepe dough is not overpowering as it is in nyc or philadelphia it balances the amount taste in the of the banana and cinnamon and then to my great delight and my wife s especially the bathroom is spotless emily tells me they will be experimenting with nutella in upcoming days we had a great experience and intend to come back again soon
5744,i ordered take out so i can t tell you anything about the staff or cleanliness of the restaurant but my pizza was good ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and an order of garlic bread i wish the garlic bread was a little crispier but it might have just been the steam that made it soggy still in search of the best pizza haven t found it yet
5745,this is an awesome addition to the dessert options in nashville i love ice cream in a cone but this absolutely knocks that out of the park pun intended being next to centennial park service the person working was a sweet older lady that was very patient and even let us try several flavors which was nice food i had the monster blue dough with m ms and peanut butter chips and the red velvet in a french vanilla cone with caramel talk about treating yourself so rich delicious and heavy if im honest next time i will have to split two scoops in a cone as the portions are outrageously large not a bad thing overall this place is a huge treat for your significant other or your kids i highly recommend trying nobaked at least once
5746,i have driven down campbell rd for years and didn t bat an eye at this joint after anguishing over the lack of available ramen i know they aren t the same cool your jets joints on a monday night due to business hours i thought i d give this place a try after perusing yelp what a surprise this place is a gem hiding behind a corny name i notably know very little about chinese food and was settled on the kung fu beef noodle dish as recommended by fellow reviewers the establishment emphasized well earned pride in their home made noodles and complemented it nicely with a spicy soup base full of beef slices and vegetables i loved it although a bit intimidated by the modest price i should note that my serving was enough for dinner and leftovers i was absolutely delighted with this choice and am interested in trying some of their other options great place and worth many visits staff was pleasant and were delightful hosts despite my request for takeout
5747,we had a tour sampling and flight at the bar drinks and ambiance were amazing beyond that out tour guide was excellent she was very informative and laid back making the your feel more like a visit with old friends than a lecture only thing i wish for our guide is that she get sent to ireland to visit the other distillery the owner has so that she can add even more knowledge to the tour
5748,the cocktails are absolutely perfect with the entrees amazing flavor combinations and reasonably priced this was our first time but definitely not our last our server kara was wonderful
5749,awesome little dessert place with teeny little cupcakes think portion control if you re dieting and huge slices of cake if you re not dieting they also have dessert bars too they serve coffee tea wine and beer table service was a nice surprise prices were reasonable for what you get coffee was very good and refills on the house it was a little loud with all the tables and counter seats full kind of made it hard to hold a conversation with my friend without shouting at each other if it weren t for that i would have given a 5 star rating other than that it was awesome be sure to try a salted caramel bite or 2 or 3 they even have a pupcake you can buy for your puppy nice touch for dog lovers
5750,excellent the sushi was fresh and high quality the teriyaki was amazing service was fast and friendly highly recommended
5751,this place is a must go to i mean every time i am remotely close to karma i go out of my way to go i have tried multiple items and have never been disappointed it s just perfection and i recommend it to anyone that gets close to the area
5752,i had ordered lunch today after not having sushi for over seven weeks the food was outstanding i ordered the hawaii and it was excellent the place is so clean and the staff is so friendly can t wait to have lunch again
5753,we visited carpenteria to get some driftwood on the beach while visiting we were checking on yelp where to have brunch it was a sunday and two of the restaurants with high reviews were closed we went to another restaurant and did not like menu or vibes we ended up at pass to beach grill and was pleasantly surprised the food was great and the atmosphere even better we will be returning soon and have recommended it to many people
5754,off the beaten path cool wine spot music food and great ambiance it s at the corner of the bywater so i would def take a car at night once inside tho it s another world great wine selection you grab a bottle and some cheese and salami and you re set
5755,great little place food is amazing here found this place just by driving by and i m so glad i did
5756,i like this place all of the food taste good and is reasonably priced it s a step up in food quality from usual chains like cheesecake factory and such the menu is very large with some creative items i ve never had anything bad there but i ve also never had anything great everything is consistently good which is fine with me the atmosphere is excellent as is the bread i dislike that they don t have reservations and the service has been hit or miss in my experience,big fan of this place they have the best sugar cookies and butter cake although the butter cake starts getting stale within hours so eat it fast they are always so nice gave a cookie to my daughter today while we waited in line most importantly i just leaned they make breakfast sandwiches on fridays saturdays and sundays they are excellent and come with western potatoes and a croissant you can see one half of a breakfast sandwich in my picture all of this for just 6 99 a very good value considering their normal bakery items are a bit expensive but worth it
5757,wow an incredible lunch spot the owner is very hands on and personally makes all the food with his wife it s clean authentic and top notch middle eastern cuisine i highly recommend this family friendly establishment i got the chicken kabob platter and it was amazing
5758,amazing i haven t had that kind of quality customer service in a very long time from initial call to installation and now follow up i m just more than satisfied the technician kacem was the icing on the cake as he was not only friendly and professional but obviously skilled as well i will recommend puls to everyone
5759,the atmosphere is amazing great spot for happy hour date night or sunday brunch the food is so great good portion sizes creative and just so yummy danna the owner came over and greeted us she is lovely i had champagne and the caesar both delicious and our bar tender was so courteous and attentive not disappointed
5760,we ate here twice on our recent trip we enjoyed sitting outside we had crawfish crab and my favorite was the roast beef po boy
5761,i consistently have an excellent experience here last month i had their take out 3 nights in a row and still enjoyed it i frequent there at least weekly a few must try s are the general tso s chicken the mongolian beef and vegetable delight it s the go to place for my roommate and i affordable prices especially for the quality and amount of food i ve dined in a few times and the ambience is nice contemporary art work on the walls and classical music playing do yourself a favor and try it out you will not regret it
5762,wonderful wonderful food and service we had an outstanding lunch amid bonus that it was directly across the street from our hotel 1 star off for service on the next day i called that morning to order a to go to take with me for my long flight home i specified pick up time when i got there they said the person who took the order forgot about it it wasn t ready and i couldn t wait as i had to leave for the airport disappointed when i had to have airport food instead
5763,the service was very good and our food came out pretty quickly the food was just so so though my grain salad farro has crunchy bits like it was undercooked or left out to harden my husband has the chicken and said it was dry honestly not a terrible meal but at 17 a plate it was not worth the price
5764,excellent brunch place could be in la or san francisco or any major metropolis i had the monte cristo with sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes it was so good i sat outside but it was too cold and so i requested going closer to a heat lamp the servers were very receptive the service was great and the recommendations were spot on i ll definitely be back
5765,employees don t make the atmosphere very welcoming would probably be better for the business to train their employees at least to smile other than that the crepes weren t bad
5766,great choice for a fast healthy low cal meal i made my own salmon bowl feta avocado spinach egg and almonds so many greens i thought i was on a golf course
5767,this is a quaint little neighborhood italian restaurant food is always very good service great as well can t go wrong with any of the veal dishes cannoli s are awesome for dessert
5768,who can say no to oysters when in nola acme was on my list from the moment i knew i was heading out south so i was excited to find out that they had this location located in harrah s casino the vibe of this location is more las vegas than nola for vibe so if you want the more authentic feel i would go to another spot the line doesn t move as quickly as you would think so if you re coming with a larger group come after 8pm because the line tables emptied out by then for 20 you can get yourself 1 dozen oysters i thought the oysters had a yummy herb butter cheese sauce but they were on the smaller side of the scale so the 1 dozen went by really quickly the oysters were good but i think the shrimp etouffe was the clear winner of the dishes we had here
5769,i had the veggie tacos they were really good also i really liked the interior design and music they created a nice ambiance also they give you some chips with the tacos as well which are pretty good
5770,i m not sure who could not love this garden center i went there with my wild and crazy 3year old son who i could barely keep from knocking everything over despite his exuberance the staff was incredibly helpful helped me out to the car along with the pink flamingo yard art my son insisted on and during all of this they were able to explain some gardening 101 to me
5771,the food here is tasty love the brisket and the cheese grits but we have had terrible luck with take out tried it three times and an item was missing every time a disappointing blemish on an otherwise fine restaurant
5772,it was extremely busy when we came on saturday it took about an hour to order and receive our donuts with how many people were there you get an order form and can pick what donuts you want they have some set donuts or you can do all custom despite the fact that they were packed everyone was moving as fast as they could and they were all super polite it was worth the wait we absolutely loved the donuts they were delicious and we will definitely be back,the atmosphere in this restaurant is adorable i love all of the signs tables and chairs etc my boyfriend and i came in for brunch on a sunday i checked in on yelp because the wait was an hour once we got there we checked in at the front counter and only waited five minutes before we were seated they have quite the selection of breakfast items i ordered a short stack pancakes and then i ordered eggs bacon and potatoes i was not blown away by the pancakes in fact i wasn t the biggest fan but they serve you a good portion of food and i was not able to finish it it s definitely worth the prices i ll have to try something different if we come back
5773,with the title being american social that isn t the case there is no place to just social there needs to be a place where you can just hang out and just social it s more of a restaurant than a social gathering
5774,always on the looko for manager s special at dessert section at front andc the back i found cheesecake factory brown baguette you bake it at home for five minutes and you will get amazing two loaves of soft light and moist warm bread you can eat it the whole thing,very friendly fish monger great service you can buy the famous junior cheesecake at the freezer section near the bakery,i deducted one star because the service was not great our waiter wasn t friendly at all the first question was soup or salad i wanted to order appetizer and lunch special but he assumed we were having lunch seaweed salad was really good shiomay was small but good the sashimi was fresh banzai roll was great and unique raw salmon and white fish with avocado and fish egg wrapped in cucumber with some sweet sauce perfect for those who is looking for no rice roll salad dressing was more like carrot pure
5775,we had a great experience with lynden at gsr johnny rockets we fed 2 teenagers and an energetic 10 yo as well as 3 adults it was very busy and lynden was right on top of it and food was delicious thanks lyndel
5776,my colleague and i were in town for a conference and wanted to make sure we made the most during our time in new orleans there is not better tour in new orleans this is a must do when in town thank you leon for keeping the history alive and your continued activism throughout the years in new orleans
5777,my husband and i ate at this restaurant when i was in nashville for a conference the thing i like about tapas is that the portions are smaller so you can try more dishes our server david was helpful suggesting ones to try and showing us the ones we didn t for next time our favorites were the tuna poke brussel sprouts and scallops the mixture of flavors were unique and delicious the chef has acquired ideas from his studies in both south america and europe i look forward to returning to nashville to try some more of these delicious dishes,very elegant italian restaurant with attentive staff i had the gnocchi with syrah and my husband had the risotto special with a cabernet the dishes and wine were excellent portions are large we wished we had room for the bananas foster but chose the lighter mousse which was delicious i would definitely eat here again
5778,best authentic mexican food i ve had it s the best mexican restaurant in the city you gotta try panchos nachos secret menu ask the owner for them
5779,amazing facility and exhibits the museum has acquired so many artifacts and collectibles of the life and times of so many historical people the 9 and 11 year olds loved the museum and all of its interactive exhibits we look forward to many returns to a wonderful representation of the old west
5780,brian was our tour guide and he was amazing we had 4 teenagers and an 11year old we all loved it comments from the girls he taught us sooo much history it was as funny as 10 episodes of drunk history note he of course was not drunk it is a hilarious show best story teller he made it so interesting why can t our teachers be like brian oh so like princess and the frog like makes so much more sense now from 11 yo we were worried that it was 2 hours of walking but it was more of a stroll and we stopped a lot to hear stories we took a break in the middle and got sno balls got in some air conditioning and went to the bathrooms don t worry about the walking part being too much brian is so interesting you won t even realize how much time has gone by
5781,in indy for another vball tourney and decided to hit a favorite pittsburgh spot typical bar food but with the primanti bro twist of everything on the sandwich overall good burgers and sandwich service was excellent hence my 4 stars i would give 3 stars for food really good beer selection or course not like the yard house around the corner
5782,great food great service and great people the owner is of this place goes above and beyond to make sure your dining experience is not only authentic but enjoyable
5783,i m writing this review based on the young lady who helped me taylor i used the wrong name in my check in at any rate she had the most pleasant positive attitude for 8 45 pm initially she was cleaning up and when she noticed me she immediately stopped what she was doing to help me she noticed we had the same bank card and we started chatting about that i learned that this was her 1st job and a lot of the lessons and take always she learned while working in food service i was impressed as i have a 17 year old and i know how challenging working with the public and food can be she did a phenomenal job engaging me with a smile and great attitude based on her interaction i would come back to this panera sorry i can t speak for the food i actually was getting a to go order for me daughter and tasted nothing check them out

5786,moxi is a great unique museum for both children and adults the exhibits are awesome and very interactive it looks small from the outside but inside is a vast space of exploration what stood out right away was the exterior design that looked like an antonio gaudi structure seriously every exhibit or activity was super fun the third floor or roof was also super cool and the view is awesome especially since it is so close to the beach i would come back and totally worth a look if you are in the area even if you do not have kids
5787,there is never a better place to take any kind of spring work you have then john s spring service just a great experience i took my 2006 ford f 150 to get springs repaired john not only gave me great advise but he did an amazing job in a very short time i recommend john s spring service they are amazing

5792,our leasing agent highly recommended this salon for nail pampering we popped in to peek and we very happy with the variety of nail services offered and the clever concept of a welcoming cocktail bar in the foyer we will be scheduling our sessions very soon,being transplants from cali we were surprised that grocery stores do not sell liquor luckily our neighborhood alcohol venue is in the same complex as our grocery store we were impressed with the range of brands the store carries the staff was very knowledgeable and friendly we will be frequent fliers for sure
5793,hear a lot of talk about the sixers eagles and flyers it s early but look at the phillies plus the ball park is the best in baseball

5795,our favorite sushi in the area i ve always heard people who have their sushi place and now finally i do to my go to is the vegetable tempura bento because it s hard to pick just one thing i then end up snagging bites of everyone else s sushi rolls umi is fresh genuine and a must try in berry farms,beautiful atmosphere with locally sourced kitchen made everything located right in the middle of 12th south and the popular angel wings mural great place for brunch lunch if you re in the area fries were nice and crispy while the lavender hibiscus tea was gentle and refreshing this time i ordered safe but i can t wait to come back and try something new maybe for dinner as our waiter suggested
5796,outstanding deli the sandwiches we had were all great but the secret might be in the extras that they serve macaroni bites homemade chocolate ice cream and homemade brownies were all killer goofy and fun stuff made it a great place to go nice playroom for the kids as well give it a try
5797,this wawa is my favorite i work right down the road so it s really convenient to come here during lunch time their custom salads are the best and my favorite i practically live off of them the staff is hilarious they will shout funny things all day long and they keep the atmosphere so lively and funny i really do enjoy coming here they make it more than just a daily gas station stop
5798,great service treated well great quality i got a gel manicure 3 weeks ago and i just got my first chip had to take it off bc my nails grew out and that s the only reason also i work in healthcare and am constantly washing my hands and using antibacterial soap and it still lasted this long highly recommend
5799,literally my favorite restaurant here in new orleans my friend told me i need to invest in the restaurant between going there so much and ordering on postmates i love the atmosphere and the food of course i order the same thing every time pork and shrimp rolls shakin new york strip with fried rice add egg and a cobbler to drink i try looking at the menu to try something new but my heart knows what it wants it s never too crowded and has an overall good vibe
5800,very friendly great service and the food was also very good portions were huge we split veal parmigiana dinner and there was enough for 4 of us the veal was delicious and very tender we highly recommend enzo s
5801,when my daughter was about a year and a half old linda the owner helped me out by taking her for a drop in a couple times my daughter is now four and a half and i have a one and a half year old son i switched school districts from carson to washoe and i kept going to all of these other daycare places and not getting a great feel as well as the fact that they were totally booked for having an infant toddler i needed a place for both of my kids and there was just no where for my son my gut kept telling me go back to circle of friends i ve been extremely happy are there always going to be kids who attended daycare that i do not agree with their behavior absolutely there is no way to get around that whether it is in school daycare or a sports team or some other organized deal i try the best of my ability to not let those other children s behaviors influence my own and we talk about it well the best you can for a 4 year old i really like linda and the whole staff she has a little turnover and i really like that the first place that my kids were at in carson had turn over all the time the second place was a home daycare so she didn t turn over herself and the other place was a mother and daughter run joint as well they had very little turnover that s important to me that employees stick around so my kid has been flourishing both emotionally and academically she s picking up things that i m totally surprised about like starfish have two stomachs and octopus have 9 brains i didn t believe her and i had to google them i didn t read the yahoo review but people are always going to have mixed situations with whatever s going on for them all i know is that linda and her daughter helped me out greatly when i was in need several years ago and she helped me out greatly this time and it s been a great fit i m very happy and content
5802,i ve had good service here quite helpful and friendly they can get busy at times but will take care of you when your time comes decent selection of phones they stock the t mobile tuesday freebies our dog loves her t mobile bowtie and we have t mobile umbrellas and super hero capes they come in handy can you hear me now
5803,these people know how to make quality pizza if you re in town i highly recommend trying this place you will never be disappointed very clean dining room and excellent customer service as well love bambino s
5804,we loved it 2nd time food fresh and yummy great price and byob ask about the baklava yummy gyros and fresh veg going back soon third visit finds blu fully booked and we were glad to have a reservation our waiter was a nice young guy but he did not know the menu and we listened to another woman explain it too late for us to order those things that sounded good make sure you ask how much a special is we were surprised that fettuccini was 24 and a high price in the menu food was still great and comes out hot baklava can be called cheaters baklava because it is some phyllo on top and bottom and filled middle of nuts no layering and it s dry i hope their success is not starting to drop their quality that we saw moved our 5 star to 3 for competitive doylestown
5805,keke s is an awesome breakfast spot they have a wide selection of breakfast options from omelets stuffed french toast and regular waffles and more with beautiful presentation on all of their plates and large portions all of their options have great prices and the most expensive thing on their menu is about 13 the service is great and they normally have a decent wait on the weekends but are pretty accurate on their wait times every time i have been pictured is the raspberry french toast which for someone like me who has a sweet tooth was amazing it comes with 4 stuffed triangles and a good amount of filling i personally like the french toast over the waffles because it always seems like it has more filling next is the caramel banana pecan waffle and it has more bananas and pecans baked into it it s really good but i could use more caramel then there is the bbq chicken omelet and it was one of the most amazing tasting omelettes i ve ever had it doesn t look like much from the outside but it is stuffed full of chicken and oozing with cheese it s a must try and it is huge the philly steak omelet is next it doesn t beat the bbq chicken but it still was delicious the last picture is the kids silver dollar pancakes with chocolate chips they had a decent amount of chocolate chips inside and it came with 5 mini pancakes and my son loved them lots of options and lots of good food can t go wrong,cute place with great outdoor covered and uncovered seating area and bar went for breakfast and got the elvis french toast and it was so delicious great spot in downtown dunedin updated june 26 review came here for my dinner with my husband for a date night and it was great many different options to choose from for dinner and they have a different chef special every night light music playing in the background outside with fans so your not too hot happy hour is 11 00 7 00 which is 2 off all drinks our waitress was sweet and had good suggestions the owner lion was very nice and you can tell he really cares about the customers and business he was telling us about future updates to the restaurant that are coming soon and we can t wait to check them out i had the chef special of pineapple grouper which was served over a risotto cake and a black bean purree which was a huge portion and plated beautifully i m one who is all about presentation of food to drink i had the key lime pie martini which has a graham cracker rim and it was pretty good also had the boobie bounce which was vodka baileys kahlua and espresso i lovvee coffee so really liked this one and it was strong and good they also have a club attached on the other side but separate from the restaurant which we didn t get to check out this time but would be a great place to go to after happy hour they have live music in there a great spot downtown to check out and have a good time with friends or for a date night,came here today and there were about 5 people ahead of me i asked how long the wait was and they said i should be in and out in about an hour i was pleasantly surprised as i was debating on coming back at a different time they were right on with their timing i called ahead of time and they do not take appointments but as you can see are still fast very friendly customer service was able to answer my questions about prices and procedures over the phone ahead of time they were one of the better deals and they have helped my family previously with great service so i wanted to go back to them instead of a bay care it was 120 for a consultation and i also got an ekg done which was 50 extra the staff and rn s were great listened and was able to answer different questions i had great customer service friendly staff all around and decent prices when i called and compared i will def come back to here if i have any issues
5806,this was a great find enjoyed a light lunch verret salad was tasty flavors with just the right amount of bleu cheese and the tacquitos were yummy with homemade sauce and yogurt on the side the coffees and teas looked good also and nice to be in the air conditioned restaurant for a bit
5807,sooooooo good their plates are so healthy and taste good too their service was okay till i meet my server who was unkind and i was so uncomfortable to ask my favors to her because she doesn t smile at all i thought she is angry or something whatever food was great tho
5808,tried this place for the first time and i liked it they have a good deal on beers for happy hour for sure which i liked i really liked the wildey beer they had the place was pretty busy when we went and it was a bit of a wait but we got a seat at the bar and the bartenders were really nice also ordered the calamari and beer cheese fries and they were really good calamari tasted fresh and wasn t weird and chewy like some places was a little annoyed because a waitress basically told us to get out of the way because some of the people i was with had to stand the place was jam packed so i m not sure where she expected us to go and we weren t taking up the much space but whatever the rest of the people there were really nice and helpful with questions about the beers and stuff def recommend checking it out tho especially in the summer great outside seating area,food is very subpar if you ask me it s very tex mex so if you re not into that then stay away good thing about this place is their margaritas pitchers during happy hour super cheap you really can t beat them chips are prob the best tasting thing here honestly wings aren t that bad either everything is pretty much just ok if you want more authentic food go to dos segundos right up the street food there is way better
5809,this is a pretty cool spot with plenty of parking the downstairs has lots of tables and there is food available to order if you d like obviously it has all the beers on tap and they even have cocktails and wine available for your guests who aren t into beer but are into hanging out with you upstairs are even more tables and free arcade games you can t beat free arcade games if you re a fan of skee ball there are two free machines there for use sometimes there are kids here so be prepared to stake your claim of a game while some eight year old stares you down other times there aren t any kids at all totally worth a visit
5810,you know that feeling when you look down at your nails and think dang these look awful well that was me at 3 00pm earlier today my acrylic nails were growing out and needed some love i called clayton nail spa and made a 5 00 fill in after arriving i asked if they also had time for a bikini wax and they said yes my nails turned out great and the service was welcoming perfect per usual after my nails i got a bikini wax and let me tell you she was amazing she was calm we had a wonderful conversation and i could not have asked for better service sure waxing hurts like no other but the work from clayton nail spa makes it worth it also affordable pricing so after coming here for 5 years now it s still my favorite place and i always recommend it to friends and family
5811,the food in this restaurant was not something my wife enjoyed i did not like it much either and we would not return service was slow as well
5812,perfectly reliable and lovely little breakfast place as you drive along the gulf coast highway you put your name on the list my guess is there s always a list and they call your name when it s your turn you can sit inside or outside we enjoyed sitting outside and looking out at the water and watching the pelicans diving for fish the breakfast is nothing surprising but everything is done well they know how to poach eggs the fresh fruit is actually fresh and the service is terrific we would definitely come back
5813,i had the sunday 3 course meal and it was great i started with the butternut squash custard had the mushroom agnolotti entree and olive oil cake for dessert all vegetarian i enjoyed the flavors of all of them rich and interesting textures my companion had a vegan 3 course with roasted beets roasted sunchokes and crispy potatoes and a dark chocolate pear dessert there is a nice selection on the drink list and the cocktail and wine we ordered were nice accompaniments the service was great and accommodating and the ambiance was very nice
5814,my family and friends came here last night for a little birthday party the back restaurant was a tight squeeze but made us all closer the kids foods were huge portions compared to usual kids menu s i got the shrimp fra diablo and as much as i don t want to say it the food was uncomfortably spicy a few people had a noodle or two to try and their lips tongues and gums were on fire i m not sure if it s purposely that spicy or someone accidently spilled the chili oil into it i took it home with me because for 19 i was not wasting it i put some ricotta cheese in it i did not have sour cream or lemon and i still could barely eat it such a shame it came out looking beautifully and the shrimp were huge and had the tail on which i love holds the flavor the staff was quick and friendly we will definitely be back i just will not order the shrimp fra diablo
5815,new restaurant in the neighborhood finally opened on saturday we wandered in with high expectations good variety of vietnamese food ample amount of food and tasty good value
5816,we are regulars always great food service and atmosphere generous portions and appropriate pricing highly recommend
5817,i highly recommended the burger or a stromboli both of which are huge great curly steak fries too service is usually a little slow but a comfortable atmosphere and some table games prices are very reasonable and a relatively wide variety of items on the menu as a local it s one of the usual places we go when we go out s opposed to the chain restaurants near the mall
5818,i was not prepared to walk into the shop if i were to describe the shop it world be garden princess tea party and i still don t think that does it justice whatever you re thinking right now doesn t come close you are transported to a secret garden and its beautiful slightly overwhelming if you re not prepared but beautiful i immediately want to bring friends just for the experience i was sadly disappointed by the cake i ordered the nepolitan cake and lemon blueberry cake and a magic bar the magic bar was delicious i was expecting it to be sickly sweet and it wasn t now for the cake the cake itself was good where it went wrong for me was the frosting it was expecting a traditional buttercream and what i got was more of a lightly flavored whipped butter that coats your mouth again its not super sweet which i am a fan of but the frosting really ruined the whole experience for me i want to go back sit down and have lunch
5819,i am really impressed with the service here they have saved me thousands in repair costs on my first visit my second visit for a different problem resulted in a great permanent wiring repair my last visit was last minute on my part but the staff was understanding and provided another great fix they have my loyalty
5820,the good great selection healthy salads and snacks and friendly employees the bad the made to order sandwiches so messy sandwiches should be made to pick up to eat not dripping and having everything fall out and soggy bread ugh see the attached photo i mean this is ridiculous
5821,great little place with some good homemade sandwiches grab a couple before heading to the beach
5822,very impressed stopped in while visiting from out of town the customer service was unlike any other we visited another similar gym in indianapolis and wow can t even compare shred 415 was professional welcoming and really went above and beyond to make sure we felt comfortable workouts are high intensity exactly what we were looking for
5823,over all nothing really stands out here normal target nothing great but not going above and beyond anywhere the customer service is good but nothing stands out 4 out of 5 bc it is not a wow
5824,food is superior mel s chicken cutlet sandwich is everything you want in a cutlet sandwich perfectly cooked chicken with the best roll try it the only drawback is the noise it s deafening at peak meal times they have to hang some noise absorbing panels somewhere a great place to eat when it s not crowded and it gets crowded
5825,absolutely delicious polish cuisine the pirogies are plump delicate and flavorful the special of the day was a stew with kielbasa lima beans potatoes shredded beef and cabbage it was perfect stuffed cabbage was also a hit
5826,we re here once a week for the beer food company and the great happy hour deals the 2 for 1 pizza happy hour special is imo the best deal in town if you re looking to have dinner a bit early or lunch a bit late pizza selection is a bit limited however the ones we ve tried have all been delicious they re putting in a new pizza oven so i hope the pizza s are going to get even better excellent burgers as well top class blue burger and bbq burger the happy hour gregs messy bbq burger is imo the perfect dinner sized right enough to fill without stuffing yourself silly my wife enjoys the asada taco s it s a shame they re not on the happy hour menu the beer is good as well put some money into a machine and they are typically generous with the comps i think due to the limited space there is not much interesting beer usually one handle with something different but it can take a while to cycle through and get a new beer so the selection doesn t change much bartenders are friendly and always seem willing to go the extra mile
5827,food was amazing as told chicken sandwich was awesome staff was great service was fast and specially the man reason i tried there chicken it was halal i ll be there regular customer
5828,went there to see the nashville yacht club band with some friends had a great time the atmosphere was perfect i love the open bar and pool area connected the bartenders name was eckhard and he really made the experience worthwhile i could tell they were understaffed and no one payed me any attention for at least 5 minutes then he not only completes my order but creates a perfect cocktail just for me that s what i expect in a hotel atmosphere will return again only to have eckhard make me some hangin drinks
5829,headline gastropub knocks my socks off house burger was one of the best i ve had in pinellas nice char perfectly juicy that brioche bun was quite pillowy my husband s asian fusion ribs had a great caramelization were fall of the bone tender the only think that was so so was the poutine i prefer my fries crispier and the sauce gravy on them seemed to come up short on salt still minor flaw looking forward to trying the roasted potatoes in a sack with chorizo butter next time even dessert an aerated cheesecake with blueberries blood orange sauce almond crumble was legit it s actually more of a 4 5 for its unexpected creativity skills service
5830,absolutely amazing located in a cool area of nashville by vanderbilt university service is very friendly and the breakfast was awesome this is a absolute must if you re visiting nashville for a few days we had the southern benny and it was one of the best breakfast meals i ve had period they are most known for their east nasty which looked really good you also get a good cup of coffee get their early the line can get long but it s worth the wait
5831,holy cow food was amazing we started with drinks i suggest the scilian moscow mule has blood orange juice hubby got the moscato wine we ordered the toasted ravioli which though they are known for their shrimp cocktail this was delicious served are three good sized raviolis with a side of bolognese sauce hubby ordered the14 oz ribeye with izzy style pepper encrusted pan seared orange brandy butter sauce and i ordered the surf and turf filet with oscar style crab asparagus barnaise the lobster tail was huge and meaty our steaks were melting in our mouth service was impeccible hailey was our waitress and when we come back we will ask for her again we did not want for anything ambiance was fabulous it states fine dining which it was but the dress code is anywhere from shorts tee to suit and tie for dessert we ordered yes we did the signature brownie decadent classic handmade dessert served with vanilla ice cream hot fudge rich caramel sauce sweet candied pecans whipped cream and topped with a cherry it was extremely rich and oh so yummy i would highly recommend a trip there they have 3 locations we went to the downtown area wanting the experience it is a must stop
5832,last night had another outstanding experience at blues on white i love this place and have been going for years live bands are usually very good and we always have a great time here usually a group of us go and dance in till 2 am i am also a fan of the jam sessions i have been to these often and have heard some outstanding artists part of the great experience is that you never know who will be next and get such a different mix i like the new look of the place but enjoyed the low prices before the update i wish they had a kitchen but since they don t we get pizza from around the corner and bring it in
5833,great stay for our daughter s graduation love the area and the rooms were very comfortable breakfast was great and greg and jennifer were excellent host the entire time i will be back in a second
5834,been on the lookout for a korean bbq restaurant that had the cali feel and quality i definitely found it at gin the staff was super friendly and helpful but the food was amazing i m a sucker for brisket and gin exceeded expectation so glad i got to experience the opening of one of my new favorite restaurants
5835,yummy yummy yummy is all i can say i ve come here for drinks before but tonight i decided to order dinner and i wasn t disappointed my caprese burger was juicy flavorful and absolutely delicious the nachos were delightful and the frozen strawberry margarita made me a happy girl the crowd of people dining in were pleasant and everyone was thoroughly enjoying the live music up front the decor was lively and colorful which just tied up my experience with a shiny bow not a single complaint just a fun dinner out,what a yummy place for handmade icecream lots of flavors 5 or 6 different cone choices fair pricing and a very pleasant staff be prepared to stand in a line it s a full house in a narrow space only reason i wouldn t say 5 stars is due to the location there s no easy way to access this location unless you re already downtown you could get lucky and find a parking spot but with 2nd street becoming more popular it s a bit difficult to get to i enjoyed a scoop of cake batter with sprinkles it wasn t really all that but my boyfriend got the red velvet cake and that was to die for absolutely delicious
5836,this shop is a slice of disney beauty and magic hiding on the edge of broad ripple and a must stop of sweets treats and dreaminess your instagram needs this place hands down the best red velvet cake of my life appearance the cake bake shop is a beautifully decorated small white house with a captivating design the flowers around the sign make it an instaworthy post for sure and when the weather is nice the outdoor seating must be gorgeous inside the cake shop will take your breath away light airy colors and flowers and twinkling lights this isn t the kind of cake shop you do take out at you ll want to sit and enjoy food i wanted to try the raspberry champagne cake unfortunately one wouldn t be ready for a little while so i ordered a slice of the red velvet cake the floral icing work was so perfect i didn t want to touch it but i had to because come on it s cake what i assume must have been cream cheese filling in the middle was decadent and i never wanted the cake to end i felt one slice was plenty for two people it s huge i was torn between the rose cappuccino and the lavender latte i went with the lavender latte hot and it was stunning it was a creamy smooth not at all bitter latte and the hint of lavender was enough to taste but not over powering it was probably the most perfect coffee i ve ever had in my life price the coffee is pricy 6 so not a regular coffee stop for me but for treatyoself it s the way to go the slice of cake was 12 but like i mentioned it was enough for two people and for how amazing it was i think it s so worth it customer service i mentioned disney initially because the friendliness care and attention of the staff felt just like disney they were kind they helped me decide what to try and the barista even offered to make me the rose cappuccino if i didn t like the lavender latte after trying it how sweet i will most definitely think to come here if anyone visits and wants something sweet this place has my heart and is a hidden gem to anyone who has a sweet tooth check out my firsttimefriday highlight of my visit to the cake bake shop on my instagram jordanqjordanq for pictures of everything mentioned above

5842,excellent tacos i had three marinated pork chicken and chorizo all great will definitely return
5843,definitely a new favorite i live just a few feet away so naturally had to make sure i checked this place out i can say that my boyfriend and i were both pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes huge and quality of the food both of our meals were absolutely delicious the bad the staff was friendly but the service was pretty slow i think the staff was a bit overwhelmed by the large crowds also there was no system in place for getting your names down while waiting for a table so that was a little weird as we weren t sure if we were forgotten about or still waiting overall great food cute place awesome locations
5844,i love this chick fil a have never once had a problem and i lived right around the corner for over a year it is busy but we just used the app and never had a wait great food great service
5845,went here for a saturday morning brunch and it wasn t that bad cons the wait is crazy long over an hour the lighting is a bit dark the music and atmosphere is crazy loud so prepare to scream your conversations the drinks specifically the mimosa wasn t that strong and the food was good but average pros it s a nice trendy spot with fun music that you ll want to sing along to especially after drinks the staff was very attentive and friendly and the prices aren t that bad for downtown all in all it was a nice experience but don t think i ll be in a hurry to go back
5846,this looks like any old commercial olive garden but the truth is its realllly really good my expertise in italian cuisine testing comes straight from nonna s kitchen and i must say this restaurant is the best of the best of the best of south jersey italian cuisine
5847,we had valentines dinner here and it was excellent the meals were prepared as ordered service staff is very professional nice quiet restaurant in the heart of carrollwood

5855,jenna and noel exhibited the perfect example of impeccable service and genuine hospitality i was driving when i got a flat tire and had to pull into the fleming s parking lot the roadside assistance service was taking forever so i walked into fleming s for food and drink the kitchen was closed at 2 00 and not opening until 4 o clock for dinner but jenna and noel happened to overhear my telephone conversation about my flat tire situation they immediately poured me a drink and asked the chef to open the kitchen early to cook me a meal after they also invited me to try a new wine they were considering adding to the menu they went above and beyond for me during a time they were not supposed to be working simply because they knew i was dealing with a stressful situation acts of kindness like this are rarer than gold i never do online reviews but i could not let this story go untold thank you for the excellent food and service will certainly be back
5856,always looking for places that are local and not touristy this place is that great food and awesome staff located outside of the main tourist section but worth going to our best meal of the trip half muffuletta was insanely big and stuffed with meat took half home gumbo was nice and dark and had a great spice not a big place so call before you come if you have time it is worth the wait
5857,this review is for my banana berry smoothie as soon as i stood where the sign says pay here a gal wearing a happy birthday headband helped me she made my order came back i paid she gave me a receipt it tasted good too
5858,we ve been here several times now and the result is the same really like the space food beer selection and people generous portions big sandwiches best chicken caesar my wife has ever had it s sort of upscale casual if that s a term and a comfortable place to hang around not a new look still has character and definitely not a pretentious place the back bar is a hidden gem i didn t notice the first time i was there cft is the best new addition to local eateries that the area has had in years we will definitely keep returning have not yet visited for brunch just lunch and dinner almost forgot excellent happy hour
5859,i ve been here two times so far about a year and 1 2 apart and both times i ve been very satisfied they re definitely a popular central west end spot on weekends so i highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time via yelp or waitlist app when we arrived and checked in with the hostess she said it would still be about a 30 minute wait for our party of 4 a little surprising as we had placed ourselves in line via the yelp app 30 mins prior on our drive there but nonetheless we grabbed drinks at the bar after a few minutes of waiting our table was ready by the time we received our drinks didn t take the whole 30 mins the overall atmosphere is a very unique one for the stl area they have a very long bar downstairs with an equally long set of high top tables to eat at and a gigantic wall of antique glass windows we were seated upstairs which consists mainly of 4 6 person tables that either overlook the main floor or the side streets of the restaurant with them being so busy on weekends and usually having a full house it can get pretty noisy in the restaurant as they have concrete walls with little insulation don t expect to have a intimate conversation at your table burgers are excellent quality overall and the fries are always crispy and perfectly cooked i had the whiskey bbq burger and was very satisfied with my choice they have a wide selection of sauces to try too i highly recommend the roster sauce my only pet peeve is that the burgers are pretty pricey 10 and a little on the smaller size and they don t come with a side our table split a pitcher of the peach ginger spiked lemonade and it was delicious the picture was enough for all 4 of us to have at least 2 servings each they re famous for their boozy shakes but we didn t partake in any of those overall great place to enjoy at evening at downtown good vibes friendly staff delicious food
5860,have been to bliss nails twice now first for a peppermint pedicure and again yesterday for a dip nails manicure great experience both times pedicure was long thorough and relaxing they have different pedicure options manicure looks great i love the dip nails and they last a long time had two different technicians both good very short wait time both trips and the first my mom and i both got pedis at the same time will warn that it did get super busy while i was there friday around 4 and people did have to wait 30 mins
5861,the food was alright we arrive late at night after midnight and the waitress was extremely busy i did like the cheese grits and sausage patties
5862,service was awesome beer was amazing and the owner makes u feel at home for sure had a blast will deff br back
5863,excellent oriental buffet includes food selected for grilling a large array of prepared dishes chicken wings sushi edamame salads deserts and more we were in from phoenix and we found a very favorite place to eat whenever we stay or drive through tucson well done new town
5864,thanks dan for solving our issues now i can say i m satisfied with the final outcome
5865,had a really good experience and was very happy with the result of my treatment there was a mix up with my living social voucher purchase that was handled in a very satisfactory way i would definitely go back
5866,the restaurant is very clean the atmosphere is phenomenal and the food is to die for believe it or not the last time i had indian cuisine this good was in durban s africa
5867,nice romantic setting with white table cloth professional servers and elegance this is one of many restaurants under the brennan family restaurant group i ordered the bbq shrimp and they were big and succulent and peppery this dish reportedly takes 2 sticks of butter to make so be aware and take caution weber eating the sauce i only ate spittle but of sauce there was no soaking the bread for me bathroom is downstairs after eating the shrimp they give you a hot whit cloth with lemons to get the shrimp dll out of your fingers
5868,five stars for a reason you will not be disappointed blown away by this experience this place is incredible food and service the flavors of every single thing wanted to eat more but was too full the courtyard ambience is lovely the service is passionate get a bowl version of a sandwich with the coconut rice i hope i come back to reno and can eat here just wow
5869,stopped in for a quick lunch and to try the place out based on recommendations from many friends i was greeted immediately by a friendly hostess and was guided to the bar where i chose to sit the bartender was quick and prompt also very knowledgeable and recommended a great barrel aged old fashioned when i inquired about cocktails quickly moved on to an appetizer of the mussels to die for best i ve ever had and a caesar salad after these two dishes being absolutely delicious i had to dive in further into the menu the bartender guided me through the whole menu pointing out personal favorites and guest favorites i had the feeling nothing would disappoint me and asked him to pick me out a lunch combo cup of freshly made daily soup and a half order of his favorite pasta i was so impressed that if i could have kept eating i would have tried something else on the menu upon being completely stuffed the bartender boxed up my leftovers i asked for the check and it was presented in the book convivio what a nice touch these guys are the real deal
5870,this is the most innovative ice cream experience in the tri state area the idea of mixing your favorite cereal with some flavor accompanying ice cream is unprecedented very family friendly environment and wonderful staff highly recommend the milk and cookies
5871,holy toledo get in here the traditional lao food is darn tasty everything is made to order and super fresh the owner is awesome and will make suggestions if you need them
5872,interesting place with an interesting crowd given that i guess it s a speakeasy ish kind of place but that s why i like it you ve got your upholstered furnishings paintings and an aesthetic that fits right in with the other speakeasies in center city but the crowd is more center city after hours casual that s not to say you can walk in with flip flops or gymwear but the general feel is that it s way less of a hassle to step in and enjoy a drink or few over the course of the night without having to endure long lines cramped and dark waits
5873,cheap food and large selection unfortunately they forgot our order we waited 15 minutes and they were not even sorry about it bad customer service
5874,omg the lumberjack yumm we loved everything there super friendly staff lots of fun variety pizzas loved the crust local beers on tap was nice can t wait to go back kids ate every bite without the usual normal complaints to urge them to finish military discount was a nice plus
5875,it is ok we don t have much choicein our small town so it s about aa good as it gets the bad part is they know it so they typically don t care if you re happy or not food can be hit or miss service is mostly miss prices are high for the quality of food and service
5876,great place with an eclectic menu that will accommodate various tastebuds i had the mushroom burger vegetarian with tater tots and it was delicious and flavorful wait staff is helpful and attentive perfect for team lunches during the week
5877,eating here is a must if you either live in santa barbara or are in for a visit came here recently and it was worth every penny it was easily the best meal i have ever had we each ordered different things and loved it the service was great and our server was very pleasant when i come back to santa barbara i will definitely make it a point to come back
5878,good sunday brunch if you don t want the typical jersey diner food great atmosphere and service special coffees and hot chocolate
5879,my fianc and i went here on st patrick s day trying to avoid the crowds and manage a more romantic night together on my birthday weekend we sat at the bar and had a wonderful experience we ordered the trio the tossed salad and the truffle flatbread all three dishes were unique and delicious the bartender was excellent very down to earth and so nice the desserts were amazing we ordered the warm vanilla cake and the pineapple ice amazing the ambiance is just amazing the open kitchen is wonderful we even met the chef and he was great all around loved this restaurant and it definitely made our trip to philly special
5880,i loved the almond bun sweet but not too sweet toasty and yummy the passion lemonade is awesome too i like it better than the one from starbucks this is a must try place if you are at the mall
5881,tried to go to the biscuit love gulch location and the wait was over an hour our uber driver recommended this location and no wait at all we walked right in and sat at the bar the bonuts are amazing tried the nasty princess not on the menu but the server highly recommended and it did not disappoint a must for breakfast
5882,oh my god we loved this place it s located at the historic union station in downtown st louis it was so beautiful inside with candlelit lanterns just the right amount of lighting for perfect ambiance one wall is entirely devoted to windows overlooking a pier pool area where there was a spurting fire show over the adjacent pool area followed by water showers that was eye catching while we dined at lunch but not on the lunchbox menu we both had the shrimp remoulade it came with flavorable rice with vegetables mixed in and the seasonal vegetable served with was broccoli first you re served with a garden salad and toasted buttered garlic bread then comes the entree everything was cooked and served with utmost perfection our waitress helped us pick out the perfect bottle of wine according to our tastes and pocketbook the waitress had impeccable timing and always appeared at the appropriate time we also chatted with the manager we never felt hurried or pestered we seemed to be the only customers in the place which saddened us perhaps there have been too many negative reviews on yelp i don t know this place deserves 5 stars it was the best meal and perfect ambiance to wrap up our 3 day weekday stay in st louis we were traveling by amtrak station was about 3 blocks away and were having lunch in the hours before departing for home this was absolutely the best meal of all the good meals we had in st louis even a day after lunching there i m still dreaming of that meal the ambiance and thinking about how soon i can visit there again and return to that restaurant
5883,terrific coffee bar in a nice neighborhood location lots of gourmet pastries and breakfast items and great coffee went there twice in three days even though it was a fairly long hike from our hotel friendly staff cool vibe and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating
5884,this place is amazing i went today for the first time and didn t really know what to expect i do barre 4 5x a week as my primary workout and i find that it s really difficult to find something that challenges me as much as barre the workout today was super tough and my muscles were shaking several times during the workout i felt so weak after wonderful feeling i love that it s a full body workout and targets small and large muscle groups i highly recommend this workout it s very similar to pilates but that s all i can say bc i haven t done pilates more than a few times go if you re looking for a tough workout
5885,i found mom mom s food cart at a night market and now they ve opened a brick and mortar restaurant around the corner at 2551 orthodox street in bridesburg score sorry this is a bit of a bare bones review but when i looked at the reviews and saw there was only one from 2018 and none so far for the restaurant i felt like i had to get another recent one up the food is delicious flavorful and more complex than i expected i wasn t raised in a polish family but friends who were say it s also very authentic the pierogi dough is so soft and light it s almost like a crepe the atmosphere is charming and homey and the service is friendly knowledgeable and low key the vanilla bourbon apple sauce is all i care about in the world from this point on the kielbasy is from czerw s down in port richmond and it is great my partner s family has it for christmas every year i highly recommend the gobki it s got some zing and luckily for me reheats beautifully since i totally over ordered my first time here also i had never heard of pickle soup but now i want it all the time especially when it s cold and rainy and i m feeling under the weather all of the bread they serve here the long rolls the dark rye is excellent do yourself a favor and stop by this unpretentious byob gem
5886,ok so this place is my favorite and the only salon i will go to i been going here for years and i have never felt disappointed or unhappy the salon is so cute and chic just like all of the staff i have never been to a place that better customer service from the minute you walk in until you leave you are treated wonderfully you are always offered a drink the stylist are extremely talented their work is amazing the staff go to a lot of trainings all over the country to keep up with techniques i typically use brittney who really great with balayage and coloring but i used other staff for blowouts i am forever grateful to the tease staff to keeping my crazy curls in check
5887,out of all the shrimp and grits i ate while in nola their version was the best picture a tiny little local gem and that s exactly what this place is the service seemed a bit dry probably because of the high volume but good if you re a shrimp and grits kind of person do it we ordered the banana pancake just to try it was huge and good but had the consistency more of a crepe verses a pancake overall good experience and great food i ll be back next time i m in town
5888,nice little coffee and pastry shop pretty busy little place run by a sole proprietor food was good
5889,crash is an excellent guy this place has a nice and relaxed feel to it i would recommend them to anyone excellent service overall
5890,minimal wait on a thursday at 1pm everything looked fresh keep things simple and don t overload the bowl with sauce and you can taste each individual ingredient you add kind of feels like a subway for poke crafting my bowl was done in about a minute nice if you re in a hurry street parking is a little difficult to find since it s in the central west end which is my only gripe but certainly worth it for a fast and unique lunch or dinner option
5891,this place had really good bubble tea i got the strawberry also got the vegan wrap it was really good but i will ask for less lettuce next time was way too much
5892,five stars we came for our anniversary dinner and it was great we were seated in center of the aquarium and watched the fish while we ordered the food was some of the best seafood i have had grouper was spot on my wife had the mahi mahi and the shrimp and it was just as good the service was exceptional we got a complementary anniversary dessert on the house great place you have to eat here once if your in st pete,on our way back from an early morning of fishing we found ourselves in lutz fl on our way back toward home great place friendly staff and owners but the pizza was even better could have gotten some breakfast at 2 00 pm as well but the brick wood fired pizzas were large and well done if i ever find myself in lutz again i will get my fill of gluten here
5893,this was my first time at this urgent care probably the best service and overall visit i ve had at an urgent care ever i came during my lunch break at work because i saw other decent reviews and it was very close so i figured i had a good chance of getting myself checked out pretty quick and back to work i m rarely ever sick so i don t have frequent visits but this place looks really clean and inviting the moment you walk in i was greeted right away by someone and they were very pleasant there was no one else waiting and since i m a new patient i had to fill out three pages of forms took me about 10 mins i was almost immediately called back while i waited though in the lobby there was a nice huge tv as well as ample seating and a clean nice looking area as far as treatment by far the most thorough treatment i ve gotten at any urgent care and it was efficient and friendly i even had the option of getting my prescription filled at the same location which i opted to pay a few bucks more for due to convenience and saving me a trip on the way home from work nice super friendly staff all around i got what i needed i feel better knowing they gave me good info and i saved myself hassle of another trip to a pharmacy i give this place two thumbs up and five stars i d give it more assuming i feel even better tomorrow
5894,we flew into town and we re staving yelp rated sabrina s a 5 star and it lived up to the ratings it was over the top service was excellent and the food even better red pepper soup peanut noodle salad carnitas tacos and luau melt were all fantastic we will definitely go over of our way to go back
5895,always order takeout sushi from here comes really fast very fresh always good and always polite drivers
5896,hands down best gourmet mexican and tequila bar in town food is fresh and cooked to order chicken tacos out of this world carne asada tacos are mouthwatering handcrafted margaritas made with fresh lime juice and no bottled sour mix el jeffe is our favorite don julio lime juice agave and a splash of grand marnier perfect enjoy live music on the patio friday and saturday nights fabulous sunday brunch too
5897,the best and reliable guys like nick the foreign car mechanic and best customer service managers like greg and ann marie highly recommend this car repair shop flo
5898,was really looking forward to coming here but just wasn t that impressed with the food it was okay but i think there are much better options for ramen just a 10 minute walk away on washington ave the waitstaff were all very friendly and the place has potential
5899,newfields is one of my favorite attractions in indianapolis the art is spectacular and there is a good rotation and variety of exhibits my favorite part is the garden which is beautiful year round the admission is a bit pricey but you receive pretty good value for what you pay if you re not looking to pay admission you can go for free on the first thursday of every month my boyfriend and i went this past thursday while the beer garden was open there was a good selection of craft beer and a few delicious charcuterie boards to enjoy we decided to make a visit to the beer garden every month during the summer it makes for a fun date night if you re visiting indy or have family coming into town definitely head on over to newfields oh and bring some good walking shoes
5900,this joint is an oasis in the middle of an urban desert filled with surprises ranging from the awesome clean pedicure chairs to the spectacular staff and parallel to everything the amazing price i thoroughly have enjoyed the visit tech kevin ask for him
5901,the host there was amazing brought blankets to our table when we were sitting outside by the heater beautiful chill ambiance with delicious food want to come here every day
5902,consistent quality and service love the 1 deluxe props to amanda for excellent customer service above and beyond
5903,delicious food the best food i have ever had the carne asada the chicken pastries ice cream and drinks everything was great
5904,took the grapes n hops tour with shawn my wife and i had a fantastic time there were three wineries and a stop at figueroa brewing to end the tour sogno del fiori was our favorite stop the owner is very cordial and has a true depth of knowledge reagarding all aspects of wine we had a great time on the tour and i would highly recommend this company
5905,pancake house by day steakhouse by night if you have read any of the other reviews particularly for gaucho steakhouse then you will see there have been a number of bewildered guests that have dined here the family that owns this brunch restaurant closes the place at 3 cleans up and then reopens as gaucho brazilian steakhouse at 5 pm both restaurants use the same entrance and space but the signs over the entrance make it look like the pancake house is on the left and the steakhouse is on the right just go to the left regardless of when you dine here okay so the space inside is not designed for clearing things up there are large murals on the walls celebrating breakfast and area sports teams and there are posters about steak as well the space is broken up into two shotgun style dining areas the one on the entrance side has a number of tables and a bar area towards the back the space to the right is divided by a mirrored wall that is lined with booth seating for the tables that are located there pull out chairs sit on the opposite sides of the bench seating anyway i ordered my brunch selection and a bottomless cup of coffee and was generally pleased the original benny came with two poached eggs a buttery hollandaise sauce english muffin halves and canadian bacon pretty well executed and tasty on the same plate some crisped hash browns came with the order to help mop up any of the sauce left over on a side plate a colorful fresh fruit plate offered melon red grapes and orange slices the service was okay efficient comes to mind not a lot of interaction or welcoming attitude i could understand if it was a busy day but the room seemed less than half full overall if you are hungry the food is good and you just have to trust the staff to lead you to seating don t over think it review 503,if you like quality food then you will like turchetti s i went to the grand opening and was fortunate to get there just before the lunch rush it s located within the former marrow space so parking is limited to street parking in the area inside there is a window processing area at the front and once you get into the main area the order counter cooler bar are on the left side the two top tables are in the middle and the 4 top tables are on the right with the curing meats in a windowed room beyond those while waiting to place my order i noticed the menu boards for sandwiches burgers and sides posted above the cooler filled with packaged meats to go i picked up a pack of beef franks and one of beef summer sausage i was welcomed by the cashier who explained a few things to help make the visit informed i started with a double order of n duja deviled eggs they come as half eggs and went with the pastrami reuben they also have a variety of beverages including pepsi products sparkling water and a few beer selections after paying they gave me a card to place on my table so that the server could bring out my order after a brief wait the eggs were delivered wow the flavor was great i ate each half like it was an amuse bouche the yolks were flavored and though i can t tell you all the ingredients the creamy texture and the light bite of the egg white added to the layered flavor definitely an hint of vinegar mustard seed they aren t filling and are worth a taste the pastrami was delivered soon after and was excellent the rye was lightly crisped for that satisfying crunch inside they have the pastrami layered with swiss cheese and gardenkraut topping and a bit of 1000 island dressing for more flavor simply delicious and it paired well with my central state ipa the only negative i had was that the place was getting quite busy since it was opening day and the line was backing up i think once the cashier doesn t have to take time to answer a lot of questions about the place due to all the new customers things out to go more quickly still the line was moving pretty well while i was there maybe 5 minutes from door to placing your order review 1265
5906,if you get the app you will have a good time if you order in advance just walk in the dang store connect to the wifi scan your digital receipt at the register and boom you ll hear online order for your name you just skipped an entire line of 25 people during the lunch rush and dammit you should be proud of yourself wawa is pure and wholesome and it s amazing quality for the price and it s hot if you want it to be and cold if you want it to be and it s fundamentally philly why isn t there a 6 star option
5907,best price and same day turnaround time can t beat that knowledgeable and friendly and clarified any questions i had i would definitely recommend
5908,brunch was lovely at ava no wait and fast service our dishes came out very quickly while enjoying bottomless mimosas ask for different flavor options great location with a friendly staff the food was delicious i ordered the tiramisu french toast and i sampled my friends orders of the biscuits gravy and shrimp grits they let us order from the dessert menu as we lingered a bit i ll definitely be back
5909,this was the most amazing dining experience in many years ever dish was infused with delightful flavors and textures without anything overpowering i highly recommend the butternut squash soup and risotto the pad thai is beyond delicious
5910,i love to explore all the treasures in here the owners and people who work there are so nice if you happen to catch the auction well extra bonus there s something for everyone
5911,a real gem in n hatboro plenty of beers on tap and an extremely helpful staff we also had a bonus with live music on a sunday afternoon
5912,this is my first time writting a review but i had the need to do it first of all i been going to granite city for the last 4 years i m in the car industry and i usually take my employees or my family i personally love the benny and food ways i go for the rib eye or the ponzu salmon my wife loves the salads the main reason of writting this is because in my company a great customer service means everything and there is a young man that always gets my attention even when he is not taking care of me i love the way he approaches to the client and the way he sales and describes the food make you get wherever he want to sell for me this guy is not just the best server i ever had but also the best salesman i wish all of my employees were like him thank you jose pepe i cant wait to go back great good amazing service
5913,i m calling this place the la colombe of hummus like lc this place takes you on a culinary tour of lebanon and turkey the flavors are beyond fresh and unique they re totally in a league of their own the menu is slightly overwhelming so i defaulted to the original hummus and green salad the original hummus is soft and nutty just like zahav dizengoff sorry to pull so many restaurants into this but i think alluding to them shows the high standard of quality suraya meets i blame that on the tehina soom foods it is served with a pita fresh from the oven and it s soft and airy with a subtle crust the green salad included gem lettuce raw fennel watermelon radishes a soft boiled egg yogurt dressing and pita chips the flavor profile was satisfying the meal overall was light filling and nourishing i went back for seconds the week after opted for the baba ganoush pita and the rest of the party got the gravlax overall everyone was satisfied while the ganoush was tasty i think i ll stick to the hummus i appreciate that particular spread much more again service and atmosphere were 10 10
5914,this is a great location big bar to have a drink while you wait for your table lots of screens with just about every sport available to watch even those that aren t philly teams lol we were a table of four and got seated before the predicted 30 minutes they ll text you when the table is ready which is great crab fries are amazing just the right amount of seasoning boardwalk or mimic versions are always overdone burgers are great i can t speak to the seafood as much but my company would tell you to order the lobster dishes service is friendly can be a little slow but i d fault that on the amount of people crowds more than slow servers or kitchen flaws they ll let you know if your food will be on the longer side burgers for example take longer to cook overall this is a great location just about walkable from the stadiums too if it s warm out
5915,i was very happy with the powder dip here done by yen she has been in tucson a long time she was very professional and careful the place was peaceful which i like i haven t found any places near where i live that i like so i decided to look in this area near encantada mall i plan to return there
5916,totally worth the wait despite the heat i had the vegan grits with a biscuit on the side omg so good my 3 sisters each enjoyed their choices as well caution the bloody mary s are spicy the service was excellent really considering the wait was 45 mins the line moved fast and then there was no long wait for our food they have their process perfected thanks biscuit love for a delish breakfast
5917,great food very impressed i really like the brunch on the weekends chicken and waffles very good avocado toast
5918,my little man and i had a blast at the circus tonight neither of us had ever been to one before so when he came home from school with a free admission for himself i couldn t resist but say yes to taking him my adult ticket was only 18 and seating was open we found two spots right down in front and parked it quick as not to lose them the show started with tigers including two beautiful white tigers doing their tricks jumping through rings of fire followed by amazing yet dangerous acts such as tight ropes where one man almost fell tonight doing the jump rope glad he caught himself silks and even a trapeze which was spider man the circus definitely had a good amount of animal acts including dogs elephants tigers and even goats intermission came and we were able to go down into the dirt and check everything out for a cash price you could get elephant rides camel rides pony rides or have pictures taken with the dogs or spiderman there was even face painting after checking everything out we decided to go up and get in line for lemonade and taquitos to share they came with guacamole and salsa which made me happy they weren t just given to us with nothing to dip them in a circus show wouldn t be complete without clowns eek there were a few clown acts which for some reason i had in my head would creep me out because i am pretty afraid of clowns to begin with but these were so fun and lighthearted that there was just no creepy vibes at all which i was thankful for the show finished with the motorcycles carefully riding inside a giant metal ball if you will and it was literally insane four motorcycles inside there at once omgosh so scary all in all it was such a blast taven and i had so much fun and we can t wait to see more circus acts in the future
5919,just okay nothing special if you re a fan of applebee s or places like that you might like this place i had their combo chicken brisket and ribs the ribs were descent the chicken was meh and a very small portion to boot and the brisket was really tough i thought that would be almost impossible to do i had the mac and cheese and potato salad for my sides which were very good i tried the place and i really have no inclination to go back
5920,the red beans and rice was good the chicken was good they would probably make more money if they let a person substitute and i m not saying it has to be difficult if i get a 2 piece white why can t i get two wings instead of breast and wing just so simple and your customer is happy i also heard they are running a special menu during essence fest to make life more difficult
5921,went here for some delicious ice cream on a sunday afternoon there was a line up right down the street once we got inside we had a nice chat with the owner who s super friendly he gave us a description of the icecream and recommended a blend of the yam and coconut which tasted amazing together i m really looking forward to seeing how this icecream shop develops as it was only opened 10 15 days when i was there i d love to see more options on the menu as 4 choices isn t an awful lot
5922,had a panini and a chocolate chip cookie from this place for a quick lunch on a trip to nashville was very impressed with the quality of the bread and the cookie the sandwich overall was just a fine standard panini but i did enjoy the seeds present in the bread and i d like to go back and try something else next time
5923,paul in the chanel makeup counter was fabulous he is extremely knowledgeable and takes the time to give you exactly what you are looking for as far as colors etc i highly recommend him i previously had bought items from ruthie who seemed just as knowledgeable you will not be disappointed
5924,stopped by this cute little cafe after i found it on yelp i was near the area and needed a quick place to relax before an event the space is long and narrow but ample seating and bright and airy the overall aesthetic is very pleasing the pastry case by the late afternoon wasn t super filled but there were enough options to choose from like the lemon tarte which was delicious the coffee menu itself is rather small i ordered a mocha which was definitely a more bitter chocolate which i didn t mind but if you re used to sweet like starbucks this may be a pass for you the people working here were nice the prices were a tad expensive for coffee and pastries especially when the coffee isn t super elaborate i also wish they would use real cups they might have these but they didn t bother to ask if my order was to go or not they offer bread for purchase as well the staff was nice the bathrooms clean overall a pretty great cafe in philly perfect for an afternoon pick me up
5925,brunch for the win an order at the counter style resturant that offers brunch all day this place serves a smaller menu which clearly ensures top quality and care the food is delicious my friend got biscuits and gravy with over medium eggs and i got a traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs toast turkey sausage and two potatoes the potatoes were served in a style i d never had small yellow potatoes served whole but crispy and so well seasoned on the outside similar to a breakfast baked potato yum we also got lattes which are served in to go cups so that you can take them with you they have both dairy and soy milk the smaller intimate atmosphere is clean and well kept the bathroom is large and offers a changing table and the staff is very friendly i would recommend this place to anyone who wants quality breakfast food
5926,expect a line but it moves fast food was fairly priced and taste excellent outdoor deck great i liked the cornbread and coleslaw mac and cheese not so good but ok
5927,delicious dishes definitely aiming for the french cafe feel plenty of healthy options to choose from as well as more decadent ones as well if you are looking for some classic brunch alcoholic beverages they have options as well as a good selection of fancy coffee drinks breads are fresh and closer to the european styles pleasant place for a leisurely morning with flavor,delicious dishes definitely aiming for the french cafe feel plenty of healthy options to choose from as well as more decadent ones as well if you are looking for some classic brunch alcoholic beverages they have options as well as a good selection of fancy coffee drinks breads are fresh and closer to the european styles pleasant place for a leisurely morning with flavor,if ramen is what you are looking for it is ramen that you ll get and good ramen traditional styles great appetizers that you don t see at every asian restaurant we ll be back
5928,this place has an interesting menu the night we went i wasn t feeling particularly adventurous so i went with a burger i ordered my burger well done it came out probably medium rare the waiter was apologetic and had a new burger made which was a bit over cooked but i wasn t about to send it back again my bf had the chicken sandwich which he enjoyed and the soup of the day which was literally too salty to eat we shared a salad which was great the service here was great but the food was just ok
5929,i found dr worman on yelp and am so glad we went my son didn t make it through a cleaning at his last dentist so i wanted to make sure we went somewhere he would be comfortable dr worman s office was so welcoming and he felt at ease right away he loved the games in the waiting room and he did great during his cleaning he enjoyed it so much that he said he can t wait to go back definitely recommend this office
5930,i like caposey s simple homestyle food my favorite items are the chicken pot pie soup the meatloaf the blt and the brownies the food is always consistently good service is fast and attentive prices are fair and i even enjoy the kitschy cow decor
5931,loved the poke bowls in cali so wanted to try one local to my area this one is a little hole in the wall where you order in a drive thru i built my own bowl with brown rice shrimp salmon pineapple ginger scallions sesame and spicy poke sauce overall it wasn t bad not up to par with my experience at poke bowl places in cali but still pretty good i would go back
5932,we stayed here for 5 days in the north wing room was nice clean great value staff was friendly edit we lost a ring while playing a game in the arcade with our son and couldn t find it they found it after we left the state and called us they will be mailing it back to us that is outstanding customer service
5933,i order king cakes from here every year shipped to me and to my clients all over the country i always get rave reviews at how delicious they are and of course i personally prefer this king cake to any other everyone gets a kick out of putting the icing on and decorating with colored sugar also their french bread and doberge cakes are to die for the doberge doesn t ship very well though fyi
5934,we knew we wanted a 2018 acura rdx what we did not know was that as soon as the 2019 was released the 2018s disappeared we really did not want a 2019 when we arrived at montgomeryville we met tom massi he shared the bad news that our chances of finding a 2018 were slim but promised to do all that he could he did find us a 2018 that was just coming out of their loaner program it was perfect for us he was professional kind and patient as we adjusted to all of the new technology we never felt pressured his part of the sales experience was very good and we bought the car the only reason i m not rating the experience with a 5 is because of the encounters we had after tom we were approached by a car insurance salesman who wanted to expose us to options for car insurance he was harmless but i didn t need another sales pitch when we went in to finalize our paperwork with the business manager i just expected to sign the papers and leave with my car we ended up listening to a lengthy sales pitch for extended warranties that became uncomfortable at times i wish that i d been given the warranty info on the day that i agreed to buy the car had info to take home and ponder and then make a decision i did not appreciate the surprise somewhat high pressure conversation on the day of pick up that required a decision on the spot
5935,okay this place is my mother s favorite and i can definitely taste why their curry and coconut infused flavors in their food are real authentic thai ingredients not that nonsense from a jar literally the real deal and no shortcuts real thai food has strong tasting aroma that s easy to differentiate from easy thai commercial cuisine while i did enjoy my coco ave noodle soup i kind of felt like there was more to be desired i wished they gave more soup than a ton of noodles i just felt like i ate more noodle carbs than anything because the soup base was fragrant and addicting for the price of 14 15 for that big bowl you think it s worth it it kind of is but maybe next time i need to ask for more soup and cut back on the carbs then it would be worth it i guess i also wish they could have a little more variety and other choices with the food selection one day hopefully the menu can expand another thing was their price seemed a slight bit steep on some of the items in the menu the flavors and authenticity of the ingredients partially make up for that though next time i want to try other things for sure
5936,found this gem on yelp the service was top notch came in for happy hour my wife loved the oysters were were educated on the various kinds and locations they came from great place we visited twice during our stay in the city we will go back
5937,our favorite little taco place we always get the steak chicken and fish tacos we looove the queso highly recommend
5938,for an old house that has been turned into a restaurant this place has a lot of vibe we went here for breakfast on a sunday morning and were able to quickly get a table for a party of 5 the food here is wicked good everything we got was a i got the pancake with berries and walnuts which was hands down the best pancake i have ever had another plus i wanted to order 2 pancakes but the hostess told me that their pancakes are huge and only one would be enough she was right we also got the mom and the breakfast burrito i did not try the burrito but the mom was really good as well the place itself was a little stuffy on a hot and busy sunday morning but the food stole the show this place deserves everyone of its five stars
5939,i recently visited indique s boutique on south street the customer service was top notch they made me feel comfortable to ask them a million questions since i m not very familiar with extensions i ve never found hair that will work well with my natural texture this hair is so beautiful that i m having a tough time deciding on which to install first organic curl or the bounce blow out either way i will be using indique s hair extensions exclusively going forward
5940,i had high expectations of suraya and i m happy to report that they were met we were able to find a reservation on short notice and were seating within ten minutes of arriving the ambiance is lovely with dim lighting and sections that look like tents in the desert the menu was divided into small plates larger plates to share we got the fattouch salad crispy potatoes and the fatteh everything was delicious but the fatteh provided a flavor profile unlike anything i ve tried before it was delicious we also had two different kinds of lamb and topped off the evening with espresso the bill came out to about 100 not bad for a celebratory dinner at a brand new restaurant the service was great attentive but not too attentive i m a big fan of suraya and i ll definitely return
5941,this review is based on the deli side only the pastry side is delicious 5 stars great pies and donuts ok back to my review i got a hoagie today yes eat gud makes hoagies now the price was reasonable 4 99 for a 6 inch hoagie with a small side salad i got potato salad which was tasty the roll was stale which wasn t like eat gud since their bread is usually fresh and they were sold out of french baguettes i got londonport roast beef which was tasty but was lacking in quantity they weigh out their meat to only 3oz of meat for 1 meat per sandwich they use boars head meat which i prefer but for some reason the majority of sandwich shops in hamilton don t carry so all in all good tasting meat but not enough of it hopefully on my next visit they get rid of their weighing out policy and provide more meat also i hope they have a fresher roll selection for hoagies
5942,occasionally pick up to go from here and once in a while they don t cook the meat as requested but otherwise it s fairly consistent and great tasting
5943,really digging this plaza that they re building around miniso lots of asian goodness next to each other and plenty of parking miniso is a cute bright store that was established in japan but the majority of its products are chinese if you look them up they re actually described as a chinese low cost retailer headquartered in china there are lots of things to look at think similar to an asian dollar store you ll likely find lots of cute things from purses make up to stationery and kitchenware pricing is ok i saw things between 3 and 20 ish for some of the lamps and headphones it s fun to walk around and prices are a bit cheaper than a similar bigger store in wem
5944,most authentic pho i ve had to date remember to have cash as they do not take credit card
5945,my husband and i just moved to boise and we re in need of a jeweler lee read came recommended to us we were greeted right away offered bottled water and helped promptly sarah answered my many questions and was very knowledgeable our rings were cleaned and looked brand new i bought a watch battery and sarah put it in and set the correct time this is our new jeweler thank you sarah
5946,great food at an affordable price best pho around huge many with many options to try
5947,this place is awesome we ordered through the waiter app so it could be delivered to the hotel cause we didn t have a car and the driver cancelled on us after they had it cooked and ready so the lady brought it to us and i think that is soooo sweet this is truly a great place with great people the food was yummy everything we ordered was delicious next time i go back to new orleans i will be going there
5948,indiana city brewing is one of my favorites in indy i love that they always have a light beer on tap that is hard to find these days with everyone enjoying dark beers or ipa s i only wish they had more to the space like games music or something but overall love coming here
5949,stopped in here while on a quick trip to nashville very instagram worth spot with cool sofas and fun decor we had the pickle flight and nachos along with several cocktails nachos were so good made with homemade potato chips take me back
5950,finally made it down for brunch today and loved everything great service great mimosas food was amazing we ordered the loaded biscuits and gravy sweet potato hash and chicken waffles so delicious would love to see a kids menu at brunch the regular portion is a bit too much food and a little pricy for our 6yr old but it tasted good so we helped eat his meal will absolutely be back try the noochy grits and the braised kale yum
5951,we had the 1782 the turkey and italian all good everyone happy portion size a bit small but okay service is slow but not as slow as disney springs wish we had one close to home could be good for diet since smaller sub then most but taste great people looking for more meat or bigger subs won t like this but it s good enough for most
5952,amazing little diner great service i was very pleased from start to finish service with a smile done right
5953,perfect as usual exactly what i needed after i was disappointed at a different fast food restaurant the great customer service from our server izzy was appreciated and the manager even stopped by to check on us our drinks were refilled before they were even empty and the food was awesome keep it up
5954,there are a ton of sushi places in the tampa bay area however the price vs quality issue is always a top concern when it comes to sushi saki is a place that provides good sushi at a cheap price and thus is one of our favorites here are my ratings based on different criteria quality of food pretty good at least for sushi ordered from their regular menu one of the big draws of this place is what they heavily advertise endless sushi depending on when you go it ll cost you around 16 20 you may think it s a great deal and if you re crazy hungry it might be but i think even better value is ordering off of their regular menu you have to ask for their carry out menu to see price roll a tuna roll for example is just 4 if you do the math you can eat 4 rolls and be perfectly happy and you ll end up paying less than the buffet option the sushi tastes fresh and their isn t too much filler and rice in each bite decor okay there isn t really anything special decor wise they always keep the shades closed making the whole place very dark cleanliness decent the tables are kept clean one time the server had spilled an oily dish on the floor and didn t clean it properly we saw a lady slip and fall flat on her butt the toilets are smelly and you would want to run in out as fast as possible service ok the waitress usually will ask you once for formality how the food is they are focussed on chugging through the customers and getting them in and out the door as past as possible speed of food preparation kind of slow we ordered 5 rolls of regular sushi nothing fancy and it took them 35 mins to prepare this is when the restaurant was about half full our waitress kept chit chatting at a table where other employees were eating their lunch price cheap this is the main draw of this place a typical roll will cost you 4 and a buffet will be max 20 if you re in the area and are craving some decent sushi then this place is worth checking out i recommend just ordering from their take out menu i would not go out of my way to come here though
5955,since we were disappointed that we couldn t go to santa barbara to see the show that we went there for well we decided to just walk around the area to look for a place to eat at we found so many mexican restaurants and typical american restaurants as we were walking the outside of the restaurant caught our eyes we went in and was seated right away we know thai food well and i think the servers all are thai know how much we love to eat they even gave us special fish sauce to go with our order we got the combo which comes with tom kha kai with chicken or house salad of course we picked the soup hahaha we got beef panang which was just okay we also got the the eggplant with basil leaves which was very good of course we had to get shrimp pad thai too well the eggplant order and pad thai was gone in no time the serving was actually a lot plus it comes with an egg roll and a few other things which i don t know what they are we will definitely be back if we are in the area
5956,amazing i love this place the ramen was delicious and the service was fast and friendly
5957,found elliot on avo he is a wonderful attorney to work with is with you every step of the way provides realistic expectations and delivers more importantly he is very communicative as an attorney he always gets back to you in a timely manner added bonus he has years of experience and has genuine relations with fellow attorneys and the judges definitely hire him
5958,i love this place the owner is very nice and he will take time to explain the remote and karaoke system if you need the alcohol is a bit expensive 20 for a bottle of soju and the location isn t the best but the place itself is friendly and they have everything you need to have a good time their system does not have romanized korean or japanese songs you will need to know how to read them in the original language from my personal experience now us is the best place to go karaoke in edmonton
5959,this place is great local feeling and great portions of food servers are nice and efficient this became our go to breakfast place
5960,do yourself a favor and book her ashley is fun loving professional and extremely talented in her craft she and her team will make you feel comfortable in front of the camera and will produce some of the most beautiful authentic images we will treasure the photos she took of us for the rest of our lives i highly recommend ashley and would suggest you book her as one of your first vendors she was extremely helpful in recommending other vendors for us to work with and our wedding would not have been as much of a success as it was without her just do it you will not regret your decision
5961,service was great a little slow but cool food is pretty good i got the roast beef club a friend got the patty melt it s awesome
5962,this place has fresh ingredients with lots of flavor had the california bowl amazing was visiting tampa from the chicago area and wish there was a big island poke near where i live
5963,needs some attention in the dining room good salad but skimpy on the bread no sweet tea i noticed a booth with children almost be for at least 30 minutes one was a sleep finally an employee came out to them she must have brought to work with her i was concerned because they were small alone
5964,i was in doylestown on this monday last serving on a jury and did a preliminary search the day before for a vegetarian option for lunch this came up as an option as soon as we were released for lunch i made a beeline here i have to say i was not at all disappointed i ordered the la jonba wrap bowl of jambalaya and some cornbread everything was very very good especially the jambalaya which was spiced perfectly for me and the staff was very nice a little pricey but what place in doylestown isn t but was it worth it i give it 5 out of 5 stars
5965,lovely late lunch at tre luna yesterday after a drive up from la we started with the ellen salad which was comprised of expertly seared scallops shrimp and a small salmon filet over greens we then moved on to the risotto lucca tomato parmigiano and roast chicken flavors were highly complimentary and the dish was perfectly seasoned even if the arborio was a smidge undercooked we actually ordered each dish to share but the kitchen split them for us and essentially doubled the orders much appreciated same for the enjoyable pinot grigio which we ordered by the glass but our server just kept pouring since our plans to eat light were dead on arrival we ordered the affogato for dessert also delicious did i mention the expertly pulled espresso noting too that service was impeccable our server was right with us the whole meal highly accommodating but not at all obtrusive what a gem in tiny montecito
5966,our first time here thanks to groupon and everything was a okay all the employees were friendly and polite the guys were really quick in diagnosing and repairing my husbands ac in his truck i will be returning and recommending all my friends to this place you guys were awesome
5967,i have read the reviews here i would have to agree witht the majority the staff was very friendly and payed attention to me as i needed attention i had the meat omelet and there is no shortage of meat here the home fries were crispy as requested the price is reasonable and the food is delicious this place will do well stop in and bring a friend you wont be disappointed
5968,good ole black owned southern hospitality and the food to go along with it had the fish and grits and a wonderful time with the family after church everyone was accommodating and made sure our meal was excellent the hour wait was well worth it
5969,the food is very good and we visit often but today s visit was frustrating we had our name in early and when we arrived we were 12th on the list we were a party of six and the party just ahead of us was also a party of six after waiting a while they call the sabrina party just ahead of us but the group was not ready we could clearly see the six top set and empty but no one was seated after waiting a good additional ten minute asked if we could be seated there and they could have our table when it became available the very next table but the answer was no that table sat empty and we waited and waited until finally the sabrina party arrived shortly after that we were seated that really put a damper on the whole meal
5970,great tattoo shop came to santa barbara for a weekend and walked in great customer service and did good work
5971,if you are one of us who has to go to a laundry this a great place they also have a wash and fold service the employees and friendly and helpful most importantly even when it s busy they keep the laundry very clean and well organized
5972,oh my goodness this broth was amazing it was flavorful and a good amount of spice that i was looking for if loving this broth is wrong i don t want to be right i like the atmosphere as it is simple and i met the owner deanna who very nice our waitress was very nice the only thing was that my water glass was not big enough i got the spicy miso and it was still good spicy but enough that i need the water once i got too much of a good slurp i loved how simple the menu was and the nice waitress hadn t a problem or haughtiness about answering my questions after all i ve had ramen but am no pro the presentation was beautiful and everything in the soup was yummy my favorite part was the tender perfectly cooked piece of pork floating around in my soup so good i only broke off pieces of it as i ate as not to miss the tastiness yum yum yum when we got there at about 5 we were in line but being that i consulted google about the business for friday we only stood in line for maybe five minutes which was enough time to greet my pal i was meeting there listen to google lol
5973,great service and deals much better than the bedroom store aaron powell wasn t too pushy and was willing to work with me
5974,first time here and it was excellent long wait so we learned from others to call ahead look forward to coming back
5975,very much enjoyed a business lunch at the love the hush puppies and biscuits with their respective spreads were especially tasty and after consulting with our server i was very happy with the burger which was served a perfect medium on a potato bun that stayed together even though the burger was juicy and included a special sauce aioli the kale risotto looked terrific too would definitely return for lunch
5976,i really loved this place it was phenomenal the only thing that sucked was the service downstairs on the particular day i went the people behind the counter were rude i went upstairs for a drink with much better service they have a great selection of wines to choose from they also have which i love a create your own meat and cheese platter you pick what you want on it and they weigh it and plate it and serve it the outside area is huge and cozy all at the same time they have live music and it is just a really great environment i would definitely recommend this place i will also be coming back soon i could spend my whole trip here and be satisfied
5977,don t let the exterior fool you this place is a legit taqueria with banging tamales we tried the chips and salsa pork tamale tacos dorado carnitas taco shrimp fajitas and tres leches cake everything was super flavorful and the service was excellent this is the real deal mexican food you want
5978,we had the oysters impossible burgers and wine all excellent and we can t wait to go back their bread s amazing too it was an extra special experience because the weather was nice so we sat out on their beautiful patio really enjoyable atmosphere our waiter wayne was super attentive and friendly great service 5 stars overall for sure
5979,best corn ever taste great and always fresh from the field get there early because they sell out quick
5980,this is by far the best breakfast place around the staff is always super friendly and service is always top notch i ve been here on several occasions and come almost every weekend for breakfast i m not a huge breakfast eater but i get excited for some corned beef hash from here keep doing what you are doing
5981,i got the chicken waffles it was very delious and flavorful they should expand their breakfast menu because some items you had to get separately causing the price to increase a lot
5982,great beer chill atmosphere with a small but great menu local food to pair with the local beer would definitely come back
5983,this was a very good grilled cheese i had the juice and it was good had a good little bite to it with the pepper jack the bacon mac and cheese was also very good will be back when i m in town
5984,the sushi is great my personal favorite is the crunchy roll it never disappoints i would come here again because the food is good but it does not get 5 stars due to the lack of quality service my drink hardly ever gets refilled i ve learned to only order water as the soda from the soda machine is never good it either tastes very watered down or like liquid floor cleaner one of the managers a woman is particularly rude luckily you don t really interact with her wait times can be long if you have a large party but the good food is worth it
5985,came here for a mets phillies game mets won fyi our seats were pretty good a couple of rows from the front in left field they were pretty cheap too and then we understood why the place was mostly empty for a friday game we basically could ve sat anywhere anyway in terms of the newer generation of baseball stadiums citizens bank park is pretty good reminded me a lot of my beloved citi field with more walkways and public seating in the upper areas the whole place is really tiny you could walk the entire thing in 20 minutes if you really wanted to beer prices are what you d expect at a game but decent selection food selection was fine the chickie and pete s crabfries line was ridiculous there s also a tony luke s i went with campos since the line was the shortest and i wanted to try their chicken cheesesteak meh only thing that i can ding them on is how far out of the way it is it s right by lincoln field and the wells fargo center so i guess great for tailgating but a pretty far uber ride from downtown
5986,the food was delicious we had both a chicago style and a ny style for the kids but we stole one lol the service was also pretty good the reason for the 3 stars is solely for the lack of credit card acceptance i usually carry little to no cash and always pay with credit cards and we were not notified until we tried to pay that credit cards are not accepted is this 1980 i can count on one hand how many times i ve had 70 bucks on me in the last year what would they have done if i didn t have the cash on me
5987,amazing service and quality of food staff knows how to treat their customers right highly suggest the pork chop entree
5988,this place is a treat i found this place on yelp during my trip to the beloved nola it was a last stop on christmas eve it was very elegant and exquisite the wine was good in quality and flavor the food was very fresh and delectable i tried the pate and it was a culinary experience that ended up being my main meal since my sweetheart did not want any i also tried the bread pudding which was amazing the ice cream was made fresh the drizzling and pecans where the best part i can t wait to go back and try more offerings
5989,excellent coffee best beignets great location yesterday i tried the roast beef po boy was really good this place is great and a definite must visit
5990,i loved that store i just went there picking up a phillips hue white bulb 2 bulb comes with a hub since earlier this year but i posted a video on my tech youtube channel about my phillips hue smart home
5991,we were looking forward to dining here and made reservations only to wait over an hour we were disappointed the waitress wasn t very helpful with helping us order from the menu which is in french she seemed arrogant owners seem like awesome people we loved and miss the bleubird cafe
5992,they have a few locations and we picked the one that is in more of a residential area than a busy center of the city there was no line when we arrived shortly after 11am but it was still busy it can get crowded very quickly with a very small interior they have five counter seats and that is about it while we were there most of them were there to purchase the food to go so the seats were not in high demand even though this is mainly a donut shop they also offer enticing fried chicken we ordered their very popular fried chicken sandwich available from 11am it was smaller than i thought it would be but i always take quality over quantity it was juicy tasty with a nice little kick to it we really enjoyed it we couldn t just order chicken from a donuts shop so we got a couple of donuts from their hot donuts selections we chose cookies cream and strawberry lavender we both liked the strawberry one better since it had better stronger flavor cookies cream was good but didn t have much flavor definitely a place to visit if you are visiting philly,we went to this cute little bakery cafe serving french pastries sandwiches crepes coffee for breakfast we got there quite early in the morning there were few people who were getting things to go instead of dining in which gave us all the seating options they had some tables right at the entrance and then more seating in the back the cafe is located on the corner lot so it had lots of windows on the front and the side bringing in bright natural light right at the entrance they had some bread and baked goods such as croissant apple turnover and raisin roll on the side they had lots of sweets such as macarons tartlet and clairs they also had some quiche as well since we were there super early the pasty chef was still working on some items we started off with a couple of pastries and cups of coffee i got a small latte and it was really small they ground coffee beans at the time of order which is great the coffee was quite good i wish if the mug was a bit bigger even though i did order small my hubby ordered a cappuccino they didn t have any choice of size it came in a mug that is similar to the latte mug but a bit shorter and wider they were tasty coffees again just really small we had sugared chouquette napoleon french jam crpe and paris philadelphia they were all very tasty high quality and oh so satisfying it was a fun and tasty visit the service was ok not overly friendly but efficient their sweets were elegant and sophisticated we enjoyed them all
5993,came to eat today mauricio is an amazing chef pasta was incredibly delicious the whole staff was amazing i will forever recommend this place 10 stars
5994,great value dinner food was good great price cheap draft beer but the wait was a bit much place was full at 5 and people didn t get food until past 6 we got the grouper tacos ribs slaw beans cheese bread and key lime pie all the food was excellent i would definitely recommend this place maybe go at like 7 to avoid the first rush
5995,so glad we stumbled into this breakfast place that was a block from where we were staying everything about it was great location ambiance wait staff and oh the food ok so we had to wait a bit for a table though it was worth it my friend was head over heals for the savory bread pudding for me it was the omg worthy crawfish etouffee served on top of grits did i say omg yet really good coffee and very friendly staff working there one warning when they are busy as heck service can be slow go with patience and all will be fine
5996,clean food that tastes delicious i had their turkey chili and jim s favorite sandwich and both were easy to digest i devoured every bite
5997,we love checking out restaurants on m street and moto didn t disappoint the pasta was amazing i had the strozapetti and it was one of my fave pasta dishes ever my husband had the wagu because we have to try it at very restaurant and unfortunately it was just mediocre but the black truffle butter definitely added to it the brussels sprouts were by far the best i ve ever had they re a must try the waiters were very attentive and gave great advice on the menu we will be back
5998,came for drinks and an appetizer and was not disappointed at all the best roasted brussel sprouts ever sat next to a local and had a great conversation we will be back in the future to have dinner next time
5999,ate here for dinner last night place was packed so sat at the bar the bartender was friendly and helpful with suggestions i ordered the shrimp and crabcake alfredo it was excellent and service was prompt would go back if in town again
6000,delicious very nice servers loved the eggplant and carrot appetizer with pita i asked for cucumber as substitute yummy
6001,did you think it was still possible to find a restaurant where everything is delicious homemade from scratch and affordable for lunch and light dinners their food is exceptional for a limited range of german food and doener specialities i am completely addicted to their doeners the best i have had outside of turkey the well respected restaurant reviewer laura reiley gave their food three stars out of four well deserved so try them out like me you will be returning over and over again mary
6002,great service great food definitely a great choice for anyone who wants to enjoy an indian meal you will not feel foolish asking questions about the menu because the wait staff was excellent and very attentive
6003,i was blind but now i see milktooth has truly shown me the way their grilled cheese sandwich was so good that if i had the option i would use it as a pillow and take a little bite out of it ever night before i go to bed while whispering daddy likes in fact i wish i could use their deliciously savory gouda cheese as a blanket to wrap my self in today i found true love and that love is milktooth for real though eat here it s legit
6004,amazing dinner this is one of our favorite sushi places in nashville the sushi and rolls are tasty and the portions are enormous the place is somewhat small but it adds charm to the place i highly recommend this place for those traveling through or native to nashville
6005,galatoire s has been an institution of culinary service in nola for over 60 years you can t go wrong dining here the food the service and the atmosphere all represents the nola way of life i always enjoy coming here for dinner or lunch they just do everything right from water pouring to serving coffee on this visit we enjoyed an amazing dinner thanks to our server john who made it special the appetizers were tasty and the steaks were made perfectly as we wanted them go and enjoy 33
6006,eh i was hungry it was alright i looked for something savory in the menu and got healthy instead nice staff would visit again if i was in the area and really hungry
6007,we ve been here twice with our 3 kiddos 4 2 and 5 months food is always great and i love how nice the people are because the restaurant is never very busy the wait staff is always very attentive we joke that we want it to stay just busy enough to never go out of business but not too busy that they can t be attentive and quick with the food lol but in all seriousness there food is always very good
6008,i want to love this place like full on just f n love it here is what i do love about the pepperjack cheese sticks the sriracha dipping sauce is just the right kind of spicy and damn good the cheese sticks could stand alone but that dipping sauce makes it one of my favorite appetizers in all of reno their burgers are outstanding juicy flavorful cooked to order one of reno s best the fact that it used to be carrow s actually makes it cooler to me maybe i m just a nostalgic fool but i like that it s been remodeled and not just tore down the beer selection is really good like that they focus on local brews the crazy hunky bartender that looks like he could be jason momoa s brother he is funny engaging and damn fun to gaze at hubba i want to love it but i just can t the service is just too hit and miss some visits i ve made about a dozen the service is outstanding others have been horrible almost like there is no middle ground the chicken caesar salad can be really good but sometimes the chicken is drier than the playa in august and as referenced in a few other reviews the prices are a bit high for the type of food they serve so it s a solid well deserved 4 stars instead of the 5 i want to give but can t bring myself to but hey now they have room to grow
6009,i ve lived in japan for 11 years and this is definitely the most authentic ramen i ve had in the states it s exactly why i ve been missing looking for it s seriously so good i ve had the miso and black garlic tonkotsu l as well as the karaage and gyoza and all of it was super good a little pricier than what i m used to paying for this kind of food but no real complaint because it is a gem to find in tucson
6010,so it took me a while to write this review but my visits have been so spread out in time bottom line is any way i love it my favorite server is jaclyn and even though i got nothing but good service here i would say she s a superstar so very helpful and friendly food wise i don t think you can go wrong i have been all over the menu and had all good experience some of my favorites are the parmesan fries the buffalo cauliflower and the kale salad the lettuce wraps are perfect if your not super hungry or just looking for something healthier the black bean falafel is so yummy and their chimichanga is even better than chuy s the only bad thing is you can t book a table and it s usually a long wait in line which i just hate bartenders are super hood working both the seated and people waiting behind so you can always get a drink at watch tv while waiting for your table watch out for the saturday and sunday brunches if you don t like a crowd i love it though the energy and the 2 for 1 mimosas selected wines and spirits are a perfect start for your weekend morning this is the perfect neighborhood restaurant that is neat clean romantic if you like or cool and full of sports if that
6011,seriously good food here guys even though it tends to be more popular among the more mature adults trying to be polite here its a cozy place for all to enjoy even when the parking lot is packed the line moves quickly i enjoy seeing all the available food before choosing we definitely eat with our eyes first the roast beef is awesome here as are the veggies fresh salads and the best part the desserts i m particularly fond of the sugar cream pie remember to bring tip money because you ll be checked on regularly for drink refills condiments extra napkins etc i took away one star due to the outdated decor hello 1980 and the pricing being pretty high for what you get overall a great place that makes you feel like you re back at grandma s keep an eye on the newspaper and coupon inserts this place offers some nice coupons once in a while
6012,love this place finally a korean bbq place that like california you all have to give this place some time cause they just opened and people giving out 1 stars not true this place is 4 for a restaurant that just opened for you people who don t like the wait don t go back then that simple this place has good meats and give out large portions and you can take your left overs home the wait is worth it be thankful that they finally have a real korean bbq place in louisiana
6013,i am a big fan of history hence why i chose the st louis 1 cemetery tour for us to visit out of all there are to see in new orleans as it is the oldest we visited almost literally after landing here so we hadn t seen anything else yet the tour was ok a lot of information but a tight squeeze and very very run down now that it is the last day of our vacation we ve driven past many other cemeteries that looked much nicer and that you could tour yourself without a fee also please heed warning the worst part of this tour was the extreme heat it is summer late june and very very hot we are from florida born and raised and the heat in this cemetery left me breathless there is no shade and you will literally have to change clothes afterwards after taking other tours throughout the trip other tour guides also commented about how hot it can be during that tour no one can control the weather but just be aware of what you are getting yourself into
6014,amazing calzones our kids ordered plain one cheese and one pepperoni my husband and i actually preferred the simple ones over our more creative ones can t remember the exact names portions are huge we stopped before heading back to chicago and nibbled on our leftovers on the drive home kids didn t ask once to stop for anything they had their delicious leftovers
6015,i got the hot shave and it did not disappoint they do 6 towels and a facial massage with oils in between great shave great environment
6016,this is probably the best mexican restaurant we ve been to we ordered the bacon guacamole and it was amazing best guacamole i ve ever had the fajitas and spare ribs were spot on and the house margarita was delicious the kids menu is even good as my toddler ate a good bit and she s a picky restaurant eater we will definitively be back
6017,i noticed that this location is often reviewed as serving the best gyros in town could be i can t say as it s the only place in town where i ve purchased a gyro i have a bit of a sour attitude toward beef and lamb mixed and grilled together every time i had it as a young man it tasted gamey smelled somewhat like moist dog food it s been years of avoiding gyros until tonight i had some time to wait here in this area so maybe it was time to revisit the gyro from a place that seems to know what they re doing yeah this sauce was good enough to almost make me not notice what meat i was eating it didn t taste bad at all i don t think it s something i will make a regular meal as i am sensitive to dairy cheese
6018,this hidden diamond is fabulous and the reason going out to eat can be so fun the food is delicious interesting and plentiful i ordered the chop chicken which was a real treat if you dine in you also get unlimited soup and after i finished my meal the kind owner brought me another big bowl of rice with sauce for free could have just been my good looks this place is a diamond in the rough
6019,we were looking around the french quarter for a family friendly spot that had good air conditioning nola is freaking hot and humid in august especially with a fussy 16 month old and we totally lucked out at governors the staff were so friendly and understanding made our little one feel good and served up some great food and drinks special mention has to be made to the manager bobby he makes one of the most authentic sezeracs i ve had in new orleans we just had the deviled eggs with oysters absolutely great perfectly cooked oysters i could recommend this place more because of one big reason attention to detail thanks for a great experience
6020,we had a group of 9 and had just got off the road after driving in from dallas found the bayou bistro on yelp and decided to try it seeing as it was in walking distance to where we stayed this place is a gem the food was so good and i thought the prices were really fair with good portions there were so many of us we tried multiple menu items and nobody was disappointed i got the fried chicken and it was delicious great service too while there the owners son who is a professional boxer and had a fight the next night came in and we got a picture with him great people at this place
6021,sorry but this cuisine is average at best seems like the frozen dinners i get not good the one thing that saved this restaurant from a two star review is their genuine and happy customer service go in with your expectations at the right level
6022,i have always loved mcl the food is amazing and so is the staff everyone is always smiling and happy to serve the waitresses are personable and accommodating
6023,nice hole in the wall brunch place with great specials i d recommend the barbecue shrimp and grits or their crabcake melt or make your own omelette our server attended our huge group amazingly and gave us constant water refills the grits are the best i ve ever tried here and worth trying with your meal we were definitely full at the end and needed to walk the meal off would visit again with a small group of friends
6024,so happy after years of nothing but dunkin donuts and their we re outta donuts but we have personal pan pizza want one of those someone mentioned this place not far from anything right at the old rt 70 circle was not very busy when we got there around 2 30 on a friday got a dozen for 18 75 we played a bit and made them all as different as possible some we loved and thought it would be great to have a dozen of some we could have done without some would have been great sliced in half with egg and cheese loved being able to see the whole process would have liked to see some hair nets hats and visors do not do the job everyone was very nice my one big question would be the bacon how long can you actually keep that stuff out personally i did not like it on the doughnut perhaps if it were more a dusting rather than day old chucks but really should not bacon be kept refrigerated
6025,the sushi was fresh i love how the box was organized and so colorful the soy sauce was very sour and didn t taste right,i ordered the rittenhouse roll and geisha roll on the special menu i really enjoyed both they were very fresh and flavorful i also liked the environment
6026,i ve been visiting this pizza place since i was a kid and the quality and taste are the same time after time 5 on their consistency customer service could be touched up on maybe a little more patience and more enthusiasm and then i d rate a 5 star everything else was lovely though
6027,the food was amazing the place looked great super friendly staff treated my family and i very well definitely going back again for the delicious spicy edamame gerry and all the staff was wonderful great customer service for all of you
6028,after a run of mediocre tacos places this place really excels in its quality of meats and authentic taste it s not what i m used to being from la but this is a place i wouldn t be embarrassed to take my friends to when they visit unlike many of their competitors
6029,went to no anchovies for the first time last friday had a good time good atmosphere and good food will be visiting again soon
6030,nice to find a place in my neighborhood open late kitchen closes at 10pm decent amaretto sour for only 4 bartender was very friendly nice music playing in the background i ll definitely come back again when the kitchens open
6031,came here for breakfast service is great good was excellent i had western omelette and the other in group had cheese steak omelette both were very tasty just right and fast
6032,service was a bit slow but it was a monday night and they had a groupon promotion so giving them the benefit of the doubt that they probably have more employees on staff during traditionally busy days but the gluten free pizza was better than any i ve had within a 20 mike radius and i think i ve tried them all it was amazing my husband who does not have a gluten sensitivity thought it was better than even their sicilian crust which he loves by the way glad it s in the neighborhood we will definitely be going back
6033,best place on earth love all the food great place to sit and relax i go regularly
6034,i ve always been a fan of silver peak and my husband and i had dinner there last night before going to a movie there was a very drunk man sitting on the patio by us that was swearing at the staff and trying to talk to anyone who was near him he was so drunk he didn t really make any sense a party of 6 sat at a table by him and he managed to drive them off before they even ordered i don t know why the staff didn t do anything about him the police should of been called when we were leaving he tried to do a runner but i believe the manager caught him we were heading to a movie or i would of stayed to see what if anything ever happened the experience ruined our dinner
6035,my friend and i visited nola back in june and stumbled upon riverside day spa nails the service was absolutely fantastic and clean i got a gel manicure and regular pedicure for an amazing deal i would highly recommend this place especially to those who are just visiting new orleans
6036,our first time tasting taiwanese cuisine it is definitely better than mainland china the food taste much sweeter and tastier hopefully they did not include msg we will definitely go back the next time we visit reno
6037,those sauces especially that red sauce just wow illegal tacos has some great offerings and there are some particular ingredients that you can tell they take a lot of time and care into making their al pastor meat is just phenomenal packing a ton of flavor great texture and an absolutely perfect cook every time their two red sauces are also great one is pretty spicy but continues to be flavorful and the other is a more savory almost fruity flavor that absolutely blew me away i got both the burrito and the tacos and both i can highly recommend menu is a little small but when each option is a hit that s not a problem ordering process is set up like other similar fast casual restaurants and seating is plentiful for even medium sized groups this place is in competition with some of the great authentic mexican places further south but makes a great option if you re west of broad of north of south food is a great value for money would highly recommend if you re in the area and craving some good taco s
6038,an absolutely beautiful nature park a great place to escape the city sounds you can t hear anything but nature a beautiful place for meditation as well
6039,excellent little cafe in downtown moorestown great breakfast and lunch at fair prices a few outside tables are available for dining when the weather is nice great local coffee too
6040,enjoyed the food very much service was excellent the beef stroganoff reminded me of meals prepared by mom many years ago don t miss the rice crispie treats awesome
6041,was hesitant about the buffet price but the food was pretty good as well as the ambiance experience the fried chicken the gumbo are definitely my favorite didn t care for the dessert they do close early check hours staff was very busy but friendly enjoyed eating outside and taking a walk around the historical treme neighborhood afterwards would definitely go again
6042,i d like to begin by praising the venue s name which i think is pretty clever given the location and all all right moving on the highlight for me was being able to walk into the restaurant after 11pm when the restaurant closes at midnight after i had just seen a concert across the street at the pageant and having the server bartender look me dead in the eyes not even flinch and say sure you can order food have a seat do you want a beer yes yes i do pizza wise they only serve thin crust or chicago style i m not a huge thin crust fan so i went with the chicago it hit the spot so did the couple of st louis brews i drank to wash it down good food great hospitality i can t recommend them enough
6043,hands down the nicest electrician or contractor i ve ever met had an issue with my commercial property that stopped us from conducting our business this kind older man showed up on time and took all of 3 seconds to solve my problem and didn t bill me all he said was pay it forward this is the only electrician i will ever use and you should too
6044,fantastic service great food and themed trivia every thursday night just make sure you reserve a table ahead of time they fill up fast
6045,gray brothers has been in mooresville for 10 000 years serving up tasty cafeteria style food on clean white plates to hoosiers and their guests from around the country old school ladies in orthopaedic shoes brown aprons and hair nets will ladle out homestyle sides mashed potatoes corn or green beans next to comfort food main dishes meatloaf fried chicken or baked fish from behind steamy sneeze guards as you make your way down the buffet line which is approximately three miles long it s a little known secret that there s an old timey dry goods store just behind the coat rack in the main lobby where one can stock up on provisions or barter pelts with real mooresville natives in the winter children can use the yellow 6x4 foot cafeteria tray to go sledding down hills behind the kroger across the street oh you re not goin anywhere without pie tis a fact that one can legally marry a pecan pie or peach cobbler on the other side of the bridge just south of gray brothers cafeteria
6046,this place is pretty good the positives fresh ingredients creative dressings and very friendly staff the salads on the menu are delicious the negatives be careful with create your own salad option you can unknowingly create a 20 salad since the individual toppings are pricey and the ordering can be chaotic also if you are a working professional go early or late if you have limited time for a lunch break to avoid long lines the place is packed with ladies who lunch in their yoga pants
6047,they really do have the best breakfast sandwich everything is delicious and the staff is very friendly and helpful this is the perfect place for a nice lunch date
6048,great experience to lighten up a cold rainy day in new orleans we came in on a saturday afternoon and were seated in less than 5 minutes our server was kind and attentive and the waitstaff were accommodating i ordered the crawfish beignet with jalapeno aoili and a side caesar salad the beignet was hot oozing with gooey cheese and warmed up my day to drink decided to mix things up with an adult arnold palmer i asked for regular jack instead of vodka but to my surprise honey jack was added which made it my new favorite drink the establishment itself has a pretty cozy fit which mainly allows for smaller parties in the front i did not make it upstairs but there is upstairs seating all in all this hidden gem is a great place to experience what new orleans has to offer
6049,my favorite chinese restaurant in reno been here over 8 times very happy to come here fast service good food and a huge menu excellent taiwanese dishes especially the appetizers
6050,very good coffee love the chai latte here excellent soups most of the pastries i ve tried were great customer service is hit and miss more hits than misses if you re short on time go somewhere else
6051,we enjoyed our dining experience at richard s and will definitely be back this was our first visit to the new location i will admit that my radar was up after reading all the mixed reviews and that is not my favorite way to approach dining out like i am grading them or something i don t consider myself a critic so i hope this honest review may be helpful first wow what a beautiful new facility love the lighting and decor just walking in there felt like we were transported to a restaurant on a cruise ship or somewhere besides our home town and that is really fun if you enjoy that sort of thing and we do we enjoyed a martini in the bar while we waited for our friends to arrive that might have been the best darn martini i have ever had wow again grey goose with blue cheese stuffed olives very nice lady behind the bar made us feel welcomed so far so good all of the restaurant staff were very pleasant throughout our dining experience service was top notch and our server was friendly and professional food quality was outstanding i had a caesar salad and cannelloni delicious this is definitely a high end dining experience and i totally get that some might not find enough value in this concept to justify the higher cost fun for date night or any special occasion
6052,you are probably wondering why i gave this restaurant 5 stars i review restaurants accordingly we took a chance on this restaurant it is a bit of a dive but that never stopped us we started with the suggested rum runner and they didn t disappoint lucky for my husband and i our 18 yr old is our designated driver my husband and i had two different salads and they were both excellent our two boys both had burgers and they were both excellent my husband had the blackened shrimp with fries he asked our server if they were able to go light on the seasoning and they did so an extra thanks goes out to our server and the cook i had the lobster mac and cheese to die for big chunks of lobster and pasta in a creamy cheese sauce unfortunately we did not leave room for dessert the portions are very big so make sure you go there with a big appetite
6053,went to barrio brewing on st patty s day eve traveling into the heart of tucson you get a feel for the city coming from the oracle valley this place is in an industrial part of town if your an out of towner your a little apprehensive about where your going to from the outside it looks like a rundown warehouse with a scrap metal look it took a little bit for me to warm up to the look but after my experience i became a fan of barrio my wife had a veggie burger that was average but the toppings of guacamole cheese and horseradish sauce made her burger tasty i had the california burger with mushrooms added nice size burger very well cooked the fries for me were a little below average they need to leave the skins on the fries to have some body to them we had there stout and porter both beers were pretty good with the stout being a little more creamy they have a shuffleboard table that took me back haven t seen one in years we played and had a youngster watching us play and kept him entertained it was fun we recommend barrio to locals and out of towners
6054,friday night is the best eldorado has the best buffet in the state they have a huge variety of foods from different countries it s great
6055,wonderful little market if you want great italian products and good food this is the place
6056,with flavors like buttermilk drop doberge cake and red velvet creole creamery is amazing their cafe au lait is my favorite the line might look long but they move it fast tip don t park in the parking lot across the street that belongs to he drugstore or you will get hassled
6057,very cute and lovely restaurant with a wonderful vibe we celebrated our anniversary here the other day we tried the yucca fries fried plantains stuffed piquillo peppers and the tres leches cake with peach icecream my faves were the fried plantains and dessert i thought the fries could use more seasoning
6058,always a great cold stone to visit great employees and yummy ice cream store is always clean and they treat you like family here
6059,my husband and i were invited here by a friend he raved over it we were not disappointed by far the best steak i have ever eaten the price is very reasonable too your sides which are scrumptious by the way are included in the price you will be delighted if you choose to eat here the place is small but worth the wait if there is one we moved away from tampa to upstate ny but when i return it will be my go to
6060,building and ambience beautiful food was amazing had the crepe appetizer and changed entree to also order crepe was soooooooo good the mushroom gnocchi sauce was delicious but the gnocchi itself bland the veney dish was scrumptious service on the other hand slow on average 15 min to get a drink with 3 bartenders at 1 30pm in sunday asked server for several items multiple times and never received service needs work but kitchen totally awesome
6061,it all depends on who the cook is you got some really good cooks who take their job serious and you have a few who or big on burning and smothering with grease when you have the right person cooking you get an amazing meal at a great price their soda is off brand and taste disgusting be sure to order a drink at the bar first i usually get a 2 stella perfect companion with a hot dog or burger customer service is above average most of the time
6062,this was an aptly named place to celebrate our anniversary we figured it was hard to go wrong with a steven starr aimee olexy pairing and we weren t let down we started with cocktails that were on point my bourbon based one was particularly good and i was grateful for the server s recommendation we started with the cheese plate easily the best we ve had and making a mouse out of the goat cheese was a whimsical touch next we shared the duck salad i was less than excited because i didn t think i liked duck but i was wrong it was really good and was confit prepared i had the whole smoked trout and the fish was enormous i couldn t finish it all it was served with a maple flavored farro cut with something i can t recall that made it sweet and sour it was a nice compliment to the smokey fish hubs had the filet with blue cheese sauce delicious but a rather small cut for 40 and the only reason this isn t a 5 star review we skipped dessert and coffee out of sheer fullness all in all a really nice place to spend our 24th anniversary
6063,this little coffee shop is easy to miss as it s not on a main thoroughfare and it s tucked into the first floor of a commercial building i m glad i found it on yelp though because the coffee is delicious and it s a decent spot for working it s cute and modern inside but i agree with some other yelpers in that it s slightly lacking in atmosphere and personality not a big deal but a good point i couldn t really put my finger on it also didn t help that the female barista that day wasn t especially friendly in any case the coffee is really good i absolutely looooved my drink so much that i wanted to get another it was a pretty small drink it s on the specialty menu called little sweet thing or something similar it was to die for a small rocks glass with espresso half half and vanilla shaken with ice it sounds simple but it was soooo good more like a dessert than a coffee
6064,really a great place for quality live music and lighter fare food that doesn t suck came here on a friday night crowded but sat at the bar great service polite
6065,we attend an annual conference at this location and it s a wonderful experience each and every year the parking the warm greetings the quality of the food the public areas the nature walk the gym and amenities are all top notch it s such a pleasure coming here and it is highly recommended
6066,sunday brunch loved everything it was packed and the wait was long but you can walk around the neighborhood the food was terrific and we will definitely go back on our next nashville visit
6067,super long line friendly service good ramen
6068,all i have to say is this place has john denver s country roads playing on the radio what a magical restaurant,the nurses and the doctor treated me very well they were very honest and were not greedy the facility is also clean
6069,i love me some dave s dogs i want some rn i love dave and his cooks and workers all so sweet and amazing they on point and the food just is so ridiculously delicious you will keep comming back for more i love them all try everything and keep trying them they all so good and just different i didn t even like hot dogs till i went to dave s dogs try combining dogs too my favorites are taco dog and alfredo dog so dank,if your looking for a great priced burger and you haven t been here well go you won t be disappointed i love yo add avocado on my burgers and it s even better try it
6070,this was such an adorable restaurant cam is awesome she was such a sweet server and she took great care of us and our little chihuahua the food was amazing i think i found a new brunch spot and also a place to host my friend baby shower
6071,great local breakfast joint great diner feel with tasty breakfast food including classics and classics with a twist i got the steak and eggs and it did not disappoint plus the shrimp and corn soup their specialty was really yummy even for breakfast worth checking out if in the old jefferson hood
6072,the hotel was beautiful as we stayed there for a conference aflv wait staff review the main reason i leave this bad review is because of the banquet staff our waitress was very rude and not accommodating our waitress ignored one of our members could not have asparagus or he would die we mistakenly forgot to get a meal card for his allergy we had on file for the conference she said he did not have a card piece of paper that would not allow her to make any adjustments or alternations to the meal this is a conference of almost 5 000 ppl and not all 5 000 were at the banquet a vegetarian plate could not be swiped out for the chicken and asparagus plate or a plate brought out without asparagus this makes no sense to me after she told us no i asked another waiter and he explained to me no accommodations without a card because of their supervisors he apologized but said it was not allowed he was nice once our waitress saw i asked him she scolded me and said she was my waitress and not to ask anyone else then proceeded not to attend to our table of 12 people the rest of the night empty water glasses and plates were then taken up by another waiter much later i can understand that they have certain rules placed on them by their superiors but the way she spoke to us and reacted was up acceptable not to mention we contacted aflv and they said they received similar complaints from people so jw marriott please have a conversation with your wait staff we can understand policy but somethings are exceptions or at least speak to people with respect
6073,i had the wheat berry salad sooooo amazing the bartender not sure of his name took great care of me and was so sweet love this place
6074,favorite breakfast place in town small town vibes that make you feel right at home got the banana chocolate chip pancakes which are huge they were so delicious my friend got the corn beef hash skillet and loved it as well the staff is very friendly even when we arrived 30 minutes before it closed sorry about that highly recommend
6075,love cat therapy it s so great that the cats are taken in from the local shelter and are adoptable it makes it that much more enjoyable of an experience i think the cats would much rather be there than in a shelter setting given the amount of attention they get and the overall coziness of the place also they will give you a freebie if you come in for your birthday which i thought was sweet some improvements could be made more comfy furniture for the humans maybe some couch chairs to lounge on i would be more inclined to choose cat therapy as a hangout spot if coffee and treats were actually made and served there rather than the employees having to go pick up food and drink items from a different cafe to bring back to you when your 75 minutes is almost up an employee will come remind you that it is time to leave soon unless you would like to pay to stay longer this is awkward and i feel could be done much better it would be nice to have a clock in system set up to where the customers clock in when they arrive clock out when they leave and pay however much is due at the end
6076,good lord the food is good great start up and great food i ve been twice and both time have been equally impressed with the quality and taste nice job i don t i will be back
6077,the vegetables in creole sauce was amazing so was the shrimp and grits my friend had the bread pudding was perfect best i have ever had ponchatoula cooler was refreshing my friend really enjoy it the service was excellent kevin and gary really took good care of us will definitely be a new orleans staple when am in town
6078,come prepared for an experience not just to pick up some yummy treats the shop is carefully decorated and you ll want to take some time to appreciate all the little charming details there are flowers crystals and glitter galore and tons of pictures autographs of celebrity fans of the cake bake shop i just had to stop in when i found out that the mint chocolate chip cake would be featured in oprah s o magazine i wanted to beat the inevitable crowds and wish i had planned more time to spend there and come earlier in the day it was already crowded when i got there the little cafe and the corresponding menu looks darling i can definitely see myself making a reservation you ll need one for a fun girls day lunch or afternoon tea a slice of cake will set you back 10 15 but it s huge i would definitely recommend coming hungry with a partner to share with or do what i did grab a slice portion out a little for now and freeze the rest for a late night treat to elevate a relaxing night in
6079,huge pho is huge and delicious i like the huge bowls 3 extra that you can share with friends its a good bonding experience make your own pho is the best
6080,let s start off by saying that i love love mac and cheese saying that i have to say that the mac and cheese here is so externally good i got the buff and it was so creamy and cheesy that i was literally just hit with all the flavors on this the price quantity is very good i think the most expensive one is about 12 and the amount is more than enough to share with someone else but what crazy person would ever share mac and cheese the store is very cute and although small with the outdoor seating is just so cute the staff is super friendly and they re sheryl temple is the best and just the fact that they are environmentally conscious just gives them the extra point they didn t need at this point you are actually able to take the container that they give you to re use
6081,best homemade veggie burger i ve ever had it can t be healthy for you because it tastes so good and the doughnuts here are really inventive and delicious great atmosphere and very clean love to visit here
6082,location is perfect in the french quarter hotel lobby was always bustling on our friday to sunday visit in early june good size preferred upgrade room small but tidy bathroom fun bar restaurant in the hotel infamous carousel bar would stay here again for sure,impromptu visit on last day of our visit and the tour was great you can only do a guided tour for 20 10 or 15 seems more reasonable learned a lot especially about nicholas cage s tie to the oldest cemetery in new orleans
6083,stayed here two nights for a conference the rooms were very clean comfortable and fairly modern looking convenient location definitely safe all staff was very friendly lobby is busy but nice place to sit
6084,absolutely fantastic we were lucky to have bacchanal recommended to us by a local and we absolutely loved it it s an odd set up but somehow it works and flows really well you walk into the wine shop and choose a bottle on your way out the backdoor you pick up wine glasses out of large cases then on to the food window where you order whatever snacks you would like then find your own table sounds like a lot of work but it flows well and is really fun and different i wasn t sure what wine to buy but one of the employees helped me choose one that we loved the food was delicious and the band was excellent the patio was so magical with all of the string lights and people mingling we had such a wonderful time here and will definitely return on our next nola trip
6085,i ve been doing my research for a while and overall winco has the freshest produce with the best prices as well as the lowest prices on meat avocados were 68 cents a piece yesterday while everywhere else in carson i couldn t find one for less that a 1 25 they carry a huge variety of bulk grain nuts flour honey and candy reasonably priced too if you have a large family this is your place for considerable savings you can pre order some items online like rice beans flour coffee and sea salt or call them in and they will have them ready to be picked up for you just give them a heads up i could write a whole section just for coffee their coffee selections rock checkout lines can be crazy once in a while but they do have self checkout service this is a cash only store and they don t have a bagging associates which is fine with me because i don t have anybody to blame but me when my bread gets home all squished by a potato sack i suppose that explains some of the low prices the store is pretty clean and their customer service associates are friendly and polite
6086,great spot for lunch havent eaten in yet came and ordered lunch twice ordered online thru yelp once tasty enough and efficient favorite quick lunch in area with mrs k gone
6087,georgia is so welcoming she helped me pick a few great choices of beer lovely atmosphere along with the best customer service
6088,john estrada was absolutely amazing at our wedding the music for both the ceremony and reception were spot on he has a unique talent to get people out on the dance floor he had props and was so engaging with our guests everyone had a blast can t thank him or recommend them enough
6089,just took my first class at soul cycle i m a fitness fanatic and have been to almost every gym in the city this by far was the best spin experience i ve ever had nick has insane contagious positive energy i loved him and his music was fantastic i felt like i got an ass kicking workout and left feeling great the staff was also super helpful and friendly as well will definitely be returning my only con is that it is very expensive but nick s class is definitely worth paying 30
6090,my daughters and i come here probably about once a month sometimes more the omelettes i ve had are delicious particularly the usual stuffed with onions cheddar cheese and smoked sausage so big a portion i usually take half of it home so tasty too sometimes instead of sausage i substitute in their flavorful country ham breakfast potatoes you can order with or without onions and peppers diced up and mixed in both ways are good however recently i ve been ordering their grits the ones served at the toastery taste so great when topped off with a bit of butter salt and pepper that i ve ordered them on the past few visits chris the owner is very nice as is every member of the wait staff we ve met particularly eric and jennifer love the fresh squeezed oj great place for a leisurely sunday brunch
6091,my fav pho place in the area really good pho and they are so nice and helpful don t take long at l to bring your drinks and food love this place
6092,went here for the first time a couple weeks ago to watch the nba playoffs with a friend the good stuff the hostess was very friendly and welcoming chatted with us and moved us to a great spot to watch the game there are tons of screens which is great for watching sports the waiter was also very attentive and nice always ready with water and to take orders for beer there was no particular thing that i can remember but i just recall thinking at the end of the night i liked our waiter the ok stuff beer selection was fine not too large of a selection but at least one of the major styles the only issue was that the sizes of beers weren t specified on the menu the cheesesteak empanada were alright the bad the sweet potato fries were very undercooked and hard my friend even gave his to me because he couldn t eat them i only ate them because i was coming off a 48 hour fast and could have eaten cardboard at that point the burger the philly special was also pretty disappointing it was cooked to my liking and juicy but lacking in any flavor i wouldn t order it again overall a good place to have some drinks and watch sports but stick to the appetizers and get dinner elsewhere
6093,2nd visit tried all new items this visit and loved them all moroccan chicken piadina was delicious basil hummus was my fav the icing on the cake is the lemon cookies wow pro tip hummus is 3 99 at happy hour
6094,i was searching for a florist to send sympathy flowers to a friend i visited a few in the area but flowers by mendez jackel was the only one that would deliver them that same day so i decided to go with them the result i ended up finding the perfect florist conveniently located in cramer hill i wanted to go to the shop in person rather than ordering over the phone or online so i that i could actually see what the arrangements looked like upon walking inside i was blown away by the beautiful displays they have bouquets for every occasion including anniversaries birthdays or even just a simple thank you and almost any flower you could think of including daisies lilies roses and tulips with so many flower businesses being online nowadays it was so refreshing to actually be able to see and smell all the bouquets in person in addition to flowers they have a myriad of other gifts such as seasonal decorations houseplants and cute little knick knacks as someone who doesn t buy flowers that often i was overwhelmed about where to even start the staff were incredibly helpful and patient and started off by asking me about my budget the occasion and a bit about my friend i told them about her personality favorite colors etc and they chose 3 bouquets that they thought she would like i ended up choosing the sunny sentiments bouquet which is a gorgeous cheery arrangement of bright yellow roses white daisies and peruvian lilies after ordering the flowers i ended up staying a while just talking to the staff about the flower industry and all the events that they ve decorated in the past they were so friendly that honestly if it wasn t for having work later on i could have stayed there all day talking with them that afternoon i received a text from my friend not only was she not expecting the delivery but she was very impressed by both the quality and the style of the arrangement it was the perfect choice of flowers for her and she said that it made her day i can t thank flowers by mendez jackel enough for helping me to put a smile on my friend s face while she was going through a tough time i will definitely be back again to order flowers for other occasions if you live in the camden area this is the florist for you sarah f
6095,by far the best afghan restaurant in philadelphia my friends and i went there last night and we all loved what we ordered i had the sansom kabob which was perfection from the meats to the grilled tomato and onion to the rice each part of the dish was tastier than the last every bite was full of wonderful flavors and elegantly presented i ve had a lot of afghan food at different restaurants and also home cooking with my family and this is one of the best afghan restaurants i ve been to anywhere honestly it was one of the best dining experiences i ve recently had the service was excellent and the ambience was charming and had a tasteful traditional flare the restroom was so impeccably clean always a reassuring thing to see i was already planning my next visit before i even finished my plate and i can t wait to go back
6096,finally a true blue maryland crab house in old city i visited shortly after the 4th of july and my friends and i were delighted to taste the authenticity of the jumbo blue crabs they truly are sourced from maryland i do not doubt that as a former marylander i ve had plenty of maryland style crabs and this place takes the crab cake thanks and cheers i ll definitely be back
6097,terrific little place great find for the area very good food at very good prices and april the bartender made it even better looking forward to going back again soon
6098,reed s is one of my favorite restaurants in st louis i ve been there for brunch and dinner the food cocktails and service are consistently amazing every time i visit definitely check out the three course prixe fixe option my friends and i usually do that and share so we can get a little taste of everything on the menu
6099,yes yes yes what an excellent addition to newtown we have eaten in twice and gotten take out multiple times our favorites are the chicken tikka masala lamb korma papdi chaat and aloo tiki chaat everything we have tried so far has been delicious,to start i m definitely not a vegetarian but have an appreciation for all types of foods i didn t miss the meat at all the nachos are phenomenal and highly recommended make sure to share the nachos because the portion is huge i also like the tacos love that this place is close by
6100,i love this resort i stayed for the second time for new year s eve i love the beautiful gardens and all the restaurants and bars this was a great little winter wonderland to stay inside and celebrate the new year s eve festivities and winter festivities throughout the resort were fantastic it was disappointing that i was not offered valet parking this time like i was for my first stay there weren t any bellmen available to help in the self park lot and i had quite a few bags to carry in with me it s worth the stay and make sure you don t skip the spa
6101,one of the best dining experiences in santa barbara high quality food and excellent service if you re looking for a great kaiseki experience this is the place see for yourself
6102,this will mostly reinforce what other reviewers have written about the service from the receptionist to the veterinary technician to the vet himself was friendly professional and knowledgeable the only tough aspects of my trip here was the long 1 5 hour wait and the general dingy impression of the venue the former could probably be ameliorated from an administrative stand point but the latter is probably a fact of life given the age of the building and that a parade of sick animals come through each day just a note for newcomers which you ll only learn when you step inside the office the vet office requests that you don t park in the lot next door
6103,this place is amazing their prices are lower than petsmart and petco and the ladies who work here are insanely patient and kind with my animals to address an older review they required shot records and vet info when i brought mine in they also required it over the phone when scheduling someone else while i was there so i think it may have just slipped that time they re very flexible with scheduling good with cats and one of their groomers is iscc certified which is rare in this area this means for those of you who like more than a shave down or want breed standard you re going to get exactly what you want here the shop is clean there s lots of parking and they always have really cute pet toys and treats also their antlers are the cheapest i ve ever seen pro tip for those with heavy chewers they won t disappoint
6104,great garlic parmesan wings great beer selection and service as well i recommend this place for sure
6105,adorable sunny little place with the best pastries the almond eclairs were especially great and paired perfectly with the deliciously thick and unsweetened hot chocolate
6106,it s fine for a run of the mill salad nothing game changing and not a huge selection if you re building your own wish there were more proteins especially good size salad and the ingredients all seemed fresh left feeling very meh overall i d rather go to giardinos down the road
6107,great food good customer service in general a few weeks ago when it was busy we experienced one employee who was not displaying good customer service there were a few mistakes with our food and drinks but they go above and beyond to correct mistakes i received a free taco since i was given one of the wrong tacos i like the option of outdoor seating i like the seasoned chips and taco tuesday 5 99 special
6108,found this great spot for a saturday afternoon free parking on street located in an area with some shops and a wedding venue right past carpinteria you order at the front counter then find a seat outside it s a big space next to the ocean family and kid friendly but there s also an adult only section the amtrak also passes by the food was great we ordered the regular prime burger cali club and trio fries with beer we enjoyed everything we ate while sitting looking out to the ocean will definitely come back
6109,this place has the best pho and spring rolls i ve had in my life and on top of that the service was amazing
6110,derek and sometimes steph walked riley for two years until we moved to jersey i have nothing but great things to say about this company they are so warm and friendly and always got back to me right away when i asked for last minute walks or changes to the schedule riley absolutely loved derek and stephanie and i loved reading their notes about their walks when i got home from works everyday derek even walked riley to the church we got married at so we could get photos of us together he has also walked her to get her hair cut the best
6111,by far the best restaurant in treasure island great service and amazing food every time i come here presentation outstanding had lobster bites tonight and i am blown away best meal i have had and allison was amazing highly recommend do yourself a favor and visit after meal we went to sweets and treats just around the corner and had the best ice cream i have ever tasted
6112,this is a wonderful place with an outstanding selection of quality wines and a charming and knowledgeable staff we were very impressed by the service the prices and the staff
6113,if the ancient israeli exiles took a wrong turn and showed up here instead of the promised land they better have snuck a little cash out of egypt their jewelry may have sufficed but as we know from the story it was otherwise occupied i get it you re a trendy aesthetic food destination in one of the most beloved cities by image conscious college girls but 13 for half of a belgium waffle and one fried chicken thigh that just doesn t part the red sea for me as a college guy i m looking for a sizable amount of food at a fair value and that is not what milk and honey does if you re on a 40 year journey to get here i d suggest turning the caravan around now and sticking with manna
6114,if you re looking for the perfect post beach snack this it i didn t realize how close it was to lower state street and a little walk to the beach to switch things up i ordered the dragon bowl which had pitaya mangoes kiwis and bananas the texture of the acai was very different it had a glue like texture rather than the classic icy smoothie style besides the texture throwing me off this was great the sliced fruit was fresh and the acai wasn t so cold that it gives me a brain freeze what really surprised me was how big the portion was if you re not that hungry i would recommend splitting this with someone or getting the kiddie bowl the acai bowls are a little more on the pricier side 9 but it is a filling meal there s free parking for the first 75 minutes in the lot across the way
6115,love their bubble teas because the flavor of the tea is really strong unlike most other places
6116,holiday inn express is a good place to stay for a night while on a business trip did i miss having room service yes overall i would recommend this location

6120,i walked in just looking for information because a friend highly recommended coming in i ve suffered from back problems for over 6 years and i m only 24 i ve had back surgery and been to almost every type of therapy and place in town and have never gotten anything from these places however yesterday when i came in they said they could do a consult now and see if he could help with the intense pain i was in at that moment and hour later and i walked out with no pain he is incredible and i can t thank him enough i will be telling everyone i know to come here and i will be back over and over again
6121,everybody in our lab is a fan of their food and we all come from different parts of the world and glad we agreed on this immediately it s a frequent lab lunch spot their buffet is just fantastic everything is cooked spot on and nowhere beat their price i normally have to skip dinner after their lunch buffet cuz i just can t stop eating over there
6122,so glad there is a zupas in the downtown area great selections of sandwiches soups salads and protein bowls every time i go i always have a hard time deciding what to order pictures below are the chipotle turkey sandwich and mexicali protein bowl delicious i d recommend to the management to offer 1 2 more vegetarian salads love the chocolate covered strawberry with the combo sweet treat
6123,very welcoming environment the interior has an appealing beautiful wooden theme with a touch of modern look tvs for entertainment and outside patio seating for comfort plenty of seating room and high table seating for a quick breakfast or lunch close to unr fairly quick walk from campus easy to stop by here before going to class or work in the morning great customer service family owned business with an incredibly friendly staff i felt very welcomed in during my first visit and the employees already know me by name and got to know me personally they are proud supporters of helping the local community and businesses most of their produce is locally bought simple yet great selection of breakfast lunch and coffee everything here has the great taste of homemade style diner i tried out their aa bowl and soup and was very satisfied with the taste they also serve a good assortment of eggs sandwiches and salads and can customize them to your liking this business is new to the area and has a great potential to grow into a successful community knit eatery they plan on modernizing the outside look and adding more choices of food to their menu in the future highly recommended to anyone looking into a comforting home style bite of breakfast and lunch with family a quick coffee before work school and to all nearby community residents and students
6124,i happened to just be passing by and decided to stop in i m so glad i did i enjoyed my food and i particularly loved the white chocolate pudding cake the staff was very attentive
6125,i had the live uni and the shell was still moving when it was served the uni was very fresh and was served on fresh scallop and lime
6126,we are very pleased the crew that took down our huge oak were a professional and knowledgeable group they did an excellent job we were impressed with the equipment cherry picker clean dump truck blowers this was a big job pete and ron s were not our least expensive quote we got 3 but the quote was professional from the get go and we were impressed they backed it up with wonderful work cleaned as they went were respectful of our neighbors as well i can t say enough good things about this company we are very glad pete and ron s was our choice thank you
6127,michaelangelos has been the point of many great family memories it s a very convenient location in cherry hill as it is somewhat in the middle we come here probably once every other week the meals and service never disappoint i usually go with veal parm shrimp scallops fra diavlo but last night i went with pasta dolce vita it was spectacular each dinner comes with salad and soup the apps are good and are a good sized we went with the sampler as well as calamari 5 5 every time for a cheap and quick family dinner with massive portions
6128,i only spotted two filipino restaurants on yelp and the other was closing soon so we decided to take out here the food was ok not great but not bad either kare kare had good flavored sauce but no oxtail and too much tripe pancit canton was plentiful and the lumpia s we re satisfying it is family owned and the ambiance is reminiscent of traditional filipino cultured restaurants good history provided on the menu and staff was friendly and welcoming would like to eat here next time to try the sisig i saw sizzling heading to a waiting table
6129,excellent food and service the place is functional and funky at the same time great choices for breakfast and lunch and a welcoming environment and staff
6130,bridgestone arena is a really fun place to be got the chance to attend a preds playoff game and boy this place was lit smashville has the best fans i have even seen plenty of concessions and merchandise stand throughout the arena it is fairly easy to navigate and the lines moved fairly quick before puck drop go preds
6131,quite good lives up to the hype at least the black and tan does good service
6132,three sisters caf never fails to impress our go to choice for breakfast brunch or lunch and if you are lucky the amazing keke will provide top notch service
6133,great tour guide tom with very interesting details along the way nice samples and above all it as fun also we got lucky and saw a full hitch of clydesdales and bud the dalmatian we re experienced at brewery tours but this one is the holy grail of brew tours
6134,i had the shrimp and grits and it was amazing the service was excellent and the prices were really fair i will be back thank you
6135,good quality breakfast and reasonable prices do to location the parking can be tough and during weekend the lines can be long
6136,this is best described as country chic at it s best it s old and probably needs a serious update it has an old smell to it but clean and the staff is great but it has 2 restaurants on site with live music and a pool with cabanas indoors to my surprise it s an atrium style floor plan so everyone and anyone can see you at the pool be careful this hotel gets mixed up with the gaylord hotel near by
6137,highly recommend this place it s right off of bourbon street but it feels like a world away it was such a nice escape from the chaos it s a bit fancy but we went in wearing street close and the treated us with the upmost respect we ordered ramos gin fizz and the were delicious we went back two days later because the bar tender told us about 6 absinthe during happy hour he explained how it worked and made it in front of us it was better than the old absinthe bar on bourbon street and a 1 3 of the price we had multiple mangers check on us and received amazing service we also purchased happy hour appetizers that were delicious i wish i remembered the bar tenders name because it was great
6138,i have been driving pass this store front restaurant and food truck for about a year now and decided to stop in the restaurant is nice and even have an outside space in the rear for u to dine in they serve alcohol beverages to go with ur meal hmmm did not expected it but i came for the fries i did the base fries because this was my first time but how can u go wrong with potatoes they were very good a bit pricey but i will return to elevate my taste buds lol
6139,312 is a trendy place overall a nice atmosphere i m newer to nashville and have been exploring local eats i was brought here on a recommendation as my family knows how much i love pizza for deep dish i did enjoyed the pizza that said it gets 3 stars for inattentive service taking waaaaayyyy too long to make a pie running out of two menu items and being fairly over priced for what you get i recommend going with one of their stated combo pizzas or you ll be gouged by paying 3 for each topping wtf i will be back but not for a while
6140,great coffee spot reminded me a little bit of empresso in stockton with the ambiance and of course baked goods and food offerings we ordered the avocado toast w bacon added chocolate donut cold brew coffee and an iced mocha avocado toast real good with the bacon added they use a thick slice of toast and quite a good amount of smashed avocado with red pepper flakes and microgreens fresh and not too filling which is what we were looking for on this day chocolate donut not oily greasy and not too sweet even tho it was all chocolate cold brew not strong but not light i added a little too much cream but thankfully it didn t ruin it for me it was still good service at the counter was great outside seating was nice just a nice vibe at this place i would definitely come back for breakfast and coffee when i m back in reno
6141,grabbed breakfast to go this morning as i was craving the kale tonic juice and avocado toast with bacon the food was delicious but i had to knock a star for the lackluster customer service i personal received i had to ask how much longer on the order after it has been almost 30 minutes after placing it my drink sat on the counter already made within minutes of my order becoming watered down at that point and then my food sat on the counter for a couple minutes before i took it upon myself to go ask could i pay for my meal i love the food and understand downtown events can cause longer delays but communication is key and so is acknowledging customers having to wait by being somewhat apologetic lots of room for improvement with staff but i ll definitely give them another shot down the road
6142,this place is magical anytime i m in nola i make reservations here the food is always amazing the pork belly always hits the spot on a recent visit i tried the bulgogi and it didn t disappoint try any of their cocktails too lastly the live music sets the mood i love this place everything about it go you will be so happy you did
6143,this place has phenomenal food from start to finish the brussel sprouts were so savory we ordered two helpings we also had two of the chicken tacos and two of the braised short ribs for dessert i believe we had something chocolate and definitely delicious we actually went to this place back in april but as i m sitting in another restaurant telling my friend about our experience at this place i thought i should write them a review since it was so worthy
6144,first time in nashville so first time here line was extremely long and was told an hour wait we decided to stick around and see what the hype was we actually only waited about 30mins before being seated i am a pancake lover and this place exceeded my standards go check this place out
6145,great combination of japanese and korean food the sushiya roll and the curry kutsu are my favorite in the menu everything i ve tried so far tastes fresh and flavorful for sure my go to asian spot in iv
6146,solid place for lunch got the aburi blow torch sushi and korean pancake desert restaurant is modern and looks more like a bar place was near empty during the lunch time hour
6147,first time at this restaurant and was surprised with overall experience staff were very helpful and experienced the cheeseburger was fabulous with a great mix of meats done perfectly great food will return soon like cheers with more beer
6148,i called to inquire about my chipped automobile window sandy was friendly and efficient within an hour shawn came to my house and my window was fixed lifetime guarantee courteous and informative highly recommend shawn and this company
6149,my surprise birthday dinner was here and everything was amazing we started off with the stuffed p j oyster which had shrimp and blue crab in them i do not like oysters but fried really great i had the shrimp and crawfish touffe so delicious it was made with pasta really great flavor i had some of my friend s crawfish bisque really good and creamy my two waiters elliot and tristan were awesome so attentive entertaining and simply just kind people i would definitely recommend them to be your waiters loved my experience there
6150,really good food prices are reasonable recommend to try it out if you haven t friendly people serving you
6151,i ve been to a lot of ramen places around the us and this is definitely one of my favorites the broth was perfectly seasoned in the seafood miso ramen not only that but the environment and view were definitely a plus definitely going to be one of my spots to visit often
6152,great food and great service everything was delicious i recommend it 100 definitely we will comeback again
6153,so yummy great atmosphere valerie was the best so helpful and attentive made the experience so much better
6154,the first part of the process was great the team that came to my place when it flooded was impeccable they were quick and got that process completed as fast as possible they did a great job with fans dehumidifiers keeping communication with the process the latter half i wish i could say the same a few day paint job took a few weeks painters made it known they were getting paid by the hour so they didn t seem like they were in a hurry to get the job done paint job was fine i just wish it didn t take weeks to do
6155,so i have to start this with saying that i never write reviews i never just take the time but i always read reviews i ve been going to the rock gym for years with my daughter and she loves it but yesterday they were truly phenomenal i had a group of 10 kids coming in last minute as in two hours before they were going to arrive and the gym not only accommodated them completely but gave them an awesome experience i have no complaints and kids seem to all have a blast doing the high climbs the bouldering and the slack line but really it was the customer service that was above and beyond
6156,got to for happy hour three stars bc they changed the flatbread it s now rolled note to chef flatbread is supposed to be flat please bring back the original presentation flatbread is flat barring this i enjoy each visit and i look forward to ordering the flatbread it s my absolute favorite
6157,very cheesy but flavor was just ok also they claimed gluten free but was definitely some cross contamination as gluten makes my wife sick
6158,they fixed a sensor problem on my chevrolet volt that a previous dealer didn t fix properly service rep frank went above to help process my service with my crazy work schedule
6159,we ate here a few months ago and i forgot to review it i ve forgotten the details but i really enjoyed the meal we ll be back seasonally as the menu changes to follow the sun
6160,the atmosphere in this place is pretty erratic and loud as far as the colors in a good way it does remind you of a tropical vacation paradise the bar is extremely large compared to most family restaurants the bar stools are really comfy the take out orders come from the bar the tropical drinks have sunglass pins stuck in the fruits they do beer buckets and have sangria s and margaritas and normally about 14 beers on tap the mozzarella cheese sticks were really really good the all american black and blue and good egg burgers were all delish the staff was friendly and even the hostess that set us initially came back during our dinner to check to see if everything was okay with us lots of photo apps especially when you first walk in they have the bright colored lounge wooden chairs in the lobby parrots are everywhere and it gives you the feel of a tiki bar the doors on the south side of the building are all garage door style and they open those during decent weather which creates a very nice breeze inside the restaurant it just adds to the tropical atmosphere the bathrooms were clean the floor was kept clean while we were there in the hour that we sat down for dinner we saw about 5 people come in for to go orders so if you re in one of the hotels that are close by this is a great option
6161,beautiful studio with great energy flow lots of unique items for sale in the shop jen is so warm and welcoming i felt instantly comfortable my first time here paid for one class online and accidentally went to the wrong yoga studio so i missed flow 1 and went to flow 2 the universe knows what it s doing because i felt like i needed the push signed up for new student special 39 for unlimited one month i feel ready to take on anything right now spiritualgangsta namastayforonemoreclass
6162,awesome cupcakes employees are great too butterfinger is my favorite with resees and twix coming in as a close second and third prices are fair considering the quality of these cupcakes we go back any time we have a sweet tooth
6163,we stayed at the best western across the street the folks staying the hotel suggested this restaurant for steak and eggs even though they provide breakfast in the price of the room the eggs benedict we re good and the kids menu was good service was good too show your room key and they give you a discount this could have easily been five stars but the eggs were a bit over cooked some reviews knock the hash browns but they were good
6164,this place is great you can feel like you re traveling to mexico for a bit and taste real typical mexican food
6165,best sandwiches santa barbara yet so few people know about it this place is og as it gets and all the subs are killer and reasonably priced love this place
6166,good selection of food but too pricey for what it really is all about the interior is nice and good service just too pricey
6167,anthony bourdain hates brunch i am clearly the anti bourdain i enjoyed my birthday brunch beyond my expectations and they were high the restaurant is like someone s creole cottage set up to entertain friends the service never missed a beat we were a party of four and one cinnamon bun was generous we all had a great sample something as simple as their coffee was above par don t get me started on the mimosas two of us ordered steak frites with eggs over easy satisfying and flavorful plus done to a perfect mid rare one member ordered the brunch burger another mid rare which was perfect number 4 ordered biscuits and debris perfect chocolate mousse was last up and it didn t disappoint it was our first visit but it certainly won t be the last
6168,cute place with friendly owner we sampled the black sesame and ordered the ube both were very good
6169,omg omg i would marry the man that would bring me captain crunch burrito it is what i want on any special day a friend of mine bought me one for my birthday that was the best birthday present ever my coworker use to get them for me i left work early i took personal time to go to this truck but when i got there they were closing early needless to say i was crushed please open something next to the hospital of university we need you
6170,had a great time at momo s we made a reservation for friday evening in case they were busy there was a belly dancer for part of our meal which was super fun and kept the atmosphere alive we ordered the roasted red pepper hummus which was delicious we also order the lamb gyro huge there is so much to this that you can t even pick it up to eat it very delicious the restaurant was kind of musty and warm though could have been that it was starting to rain and they had people coming in out from the outside patio had a great time overall
6171,if you re reading this review you re most likely one of the following somewhat new to the pinellas county area a snowbird looking for honda service new to the world of honda or you broke up with honda years ago and realized it s time to go back to the best car you ve probably ever owned whatever the case you re looking to avoid the trek into tampa right this means you ve got two options autonation or crown based upon personal experience this happened to both my brother and husband if you head to autonation first you ll probably find yourself purchasing from crown here s why from service to sales they re there to help ironically i was helping mom clean her three year old crv interior her new york dealership lease was up in two months she moved here two years ago and needed to find a new trusted honda dealership once the interior seats were clean we were ready to hit the car wash boom the three year old battery died leaving us stuck in my driveway honda roadside assistance towed the car to the dealership at no charge of course crown offered to replace the battery for free allowing her time to think about her next move regardless i was confident we d roll out in a new honda but didn t want her to worry she s dealt with michelle and brooks in service several times and knows they re both awesome so having had positive experiences with them helped no real pressure no real up sell karen handled our lease deal with management assistance from vinny she listened and understood that mom a senior is far from tech savvy bells and whistles scare her mom no longer deals with ice and snow no need for four wheel drive and needs to feel comfortable on the road her previously leased 2012 civic was too tight and too low to the ground with all of this in mind they set her up with a standard feature h rv crossover vehicle to reach her price point style and comfort requirements justin simplifies the finance process you ve found your ideal car thanks to sales now it s time to pay up oy the stress right no justin puts you at ease with humor warmth and banter knowing the stress involved in coughing up the cash when we told tell him mom obviously didn t need a top of the line coverage plan on a leased car but only trusts the dealership for service he worked with her ready to rock and roll regardless of the dealership closing in thirty minutes karen sat with us in mom s new h rv and walked her through each and every feature from actually setting up and testing her iphone speed dial numbers via bluetooth to setting up her quick find favorite soft rock radio stations every question was answered i ve had this with volkswagen but mom said she s never experienced that with honda overall positive customer experience we left feeling great about the purchase we liked getting to know the staffs personal background where they re from details about their families etc enjoyed complimentary cups of tea coffee cocoa and bottled water car shopping is serious business we were there for four hours keeping hydrated is key another reviewer said they make you feel like family and honestly they did sweet sidenote crown apparently loves animals while out on the lot we had the pleasure of meeting oliver a local orange and white outdoor cat though his owner lives near the dealership oliver s made crown his second home and the crew doesn t seem to mind sharing the outdoor space with him one bit loved this,i rarely bother with reviews of local chain stores but this location and the employee who assisted me deserves a positive mention first of all i found this store super tidy clean and neat and everything is organized and easy to find i stopped in today for passport photos and was assisted by frank this young man was so kind and patient he helped direct me on where to look and how to position my head in a nice way of course for the best photo results he even took the time to do another round of photos since the first set looked awful i kept blinking and whatnot what s more this thoughtful employee left his post to find me while i was shopping and let me select from one of two photos apparently customer satisfaction is a priority to frank what a fantastic experience please keep up the good work
6172,thanks to 813 com i won a contest for a free bunch in honor of national rose day i decided to get the buffet which included free mimosas everything was great good music awesome waitress of course the food was great
6173,i wasn t really impressed when i got to the counter the cashier barely even looked at me i had to ask him if he was ready for my order i ran next door to pick up the take out dinner i had order while my donuts were being prepared and they almost didn t let me back in because they were closing and thought i was a new customer the donuts were good and i appreciate them being fresh but waiting for each one to be made makes for a long wait plus they are all the same base no chocolate donut or cream filled etc i d probably just go to dunkin next time for the variety and speed
6174,my favorite restaurant in philadelphia the food is amazing and reasonably priced and it s byob which is a plus for me i ve never been disappointed in the food or service highly recommend the indian pancake mee siam chicken satay and the mango chicken but i m sure you couldn t go wrong with anything on the menu
6175,we had the burger with avocado chicken alfredo it s kind of a general selection but it was really good and the service was delightful
6176,this place is pretty darn good great staff and service if we ever come back here we will definitely eat here again
6177,great indian spot where iirc one had been formerly but closed we dined in on a quiet summer saturday and found the service extremely hospitable and attentive each dish was satisfying with emphasis on quality and attention to detail i m extremely happy to have such a good indian option available again here in south philly
6178,love this place grab a quick bowl of tasty pho and grab a bahn mi to go not the most authentic flavors but close enough for the price my only complaint is that bok choy was the only veggie in the veggie pho c mon now can i get a carrot or piece of broccoli please
6179,vince is excellent and i appreciate what s he s doing for this community i recommend all my friends to go here since the service industry can do a number on anyone s body my results have been fantastic and my lower back pain receded after one visit
6180,thank you best coffee in nola super helpful staff great service great food very clean table fast service
6181,we held our day after wedding brunch at the hattery it is a charming place the decor the food and the service was great we are so grateful and look forward to visiting again soon
6182,went there for sunday lunch buffet it was fairly busy host and servers were attentive the salads were fresh starters tasted good but were a bit too oily out of the the main dishes kadhi and palak methi matar were good breads were stiff chole was bland manchurian had a strange sauce wasn t manchurian at all 3 is a generous rating
6183,usually packed with conference event attendees from the nearby convention center totally worth the wait in line they tend to have quick turnovers so the wait isn t all that long if you go definitely try their freshly made in house juices that s their specialty but their food is also great i never leave a morsel on my plate yes the manager teased me about this and gave me free coffee lol the owners are great and that s reflected in the staff they hire
6184,i don t know if it was as good as it gets as that is pretty lofty but honestly this is the closest we ve experienced in a long time we attended the valentine s day dinner and it truly was amazing my husband got the prime rib and i got the beef medallions and they were honestly amazing it wasn t just the way it was prepared the cuts of meat were perfect price was great for what we got and the wait staff was wonderful funny prompt and very very professional there were 8 of us in our group and everyone felt the same way excellent we live about an hour away but will come here again no doubt
6185,i ve been here a handful of times now and it just keeps getting better and better with nashville becoming a more fit and healthy city rush bowls is exactly what we needed i have never had an acai bowl before so i didn t know what to expect walking in the staff was incredibly helpful and informative as they walked me through the concept and menu i ve had 3 different bowls and a smoothie and i ve gotta say the dragon bowl is definitely my favorite i ve had the berry fresh with yogurt and power bowl without yogurt i definitely prefer without its too tart for me with the bowls are topped a hearty serving of granola which adds great texture and you have the option to add fruits or other toppings the bowls have been a great pre workout snack for me with it being a quick 5 minute walk from walk i ve experience wonderful fast service each time i ve been
6186,when we walked in it took awhile for anyone to come over to greet and seat us and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant the server was attentive and brought us coffee right away which helped the huevos rancheros were delicious but the french toast was disappointing it tasted like it had been sitting awhile and had not been freshly made
6187,great burgers very good value for your money family friendly good service pretty clean will be returning,food is always top notch great selection and generous portions could use some renos but not a big issue will be returning
6188,i m not sure why this place doesn t have more stars but i love it here i have been a few times now and have had a great experience every time the outside seating area is beautiful and overlooks the water the first time i went i had the world s best turkey sandwich which is very true to the name literally the best sandwich i ve ever had i wish i could have that sandwich every day the next time i went with a large group and we did the bottomless mimosas and bottomless brunch it s a bit expensive but as long as you come hungry and thirsty you definitely get your money s worth you can also make reservations ahead of time which is nice if your looking for a place with great food and an awesome view definitely come here
6189,my family and i were super excited that persian room opened in tucson we have been specially driving to scottsdale to eat at that location yesterday we tried the food for the first time in tucson here s my feedback as far as the decor ambiance and service goes i give them full points their appetizers were very good too we ordered our favorite koobedieh kebab and that was a disappointment the dish is definitely not the same as the one they prepare in scottsdale it was dry and the marination of the meat was not the same even the rice did not have the same flavor i wish the chef and owners take this as constructive criticism and try to make a change would love to be back
6190,i love simone and her french boutique themed bakery my mom s birthday cake last year was wonderful i drop in often for croissants macaroons and other sweet treats at least once a week weekend tea parties are amazing but reservations are needed they also have additional all age events that occur monthly it s such a fun posh family oriented business once you get s cake from here you ll never go to sam s costco or schnucks ever again
6191,i ate here with a coworker we were looking for good places to eat in largo it s a cute little market that has about 3 small tables 2 seaters not much room to bring a lot of people but it s good for one or two people to go and eat the food is all made there with lots of italian goodies in freezers and fridges surrounding you i ll definitely be back,the sandwich size here is no joke they definitely don t skimp very good sandwiches
6192,great food i had the baked salmon benedict wife had the monte cristo we will be back
6193,this place was cool the kid coulda been the manager he was rad the place was a great value location was a 6 uber to the french quarter with a 24hr restaurant next door as well as voodoo bbq i d recommend if you get the chance
6194,i came here with a friend recently and we sat outside because the weather was gorgeous i started with the rosa muerta amaro bourbon reposado tequila cherry liqueur i didn t like it it tasted like cough syrup too sweet too syrupy my friend had an i d rather be fishing sotol pamplemousse fennel cucumber jalapeno she also didn t like hers something of an odd aftertaste not the greatest start but we d been there before and knew it could be good for our second round we both did a seasonal offering i believe it was called a rum johnnie rum delicious i forget what exactly it had in it obviously rum some tropical fruit like pineapple maybe mango or orange and something else it was great basically juice but in a good way we had two rounds of that one for food we each got the biscuit we were sad that now they were duck fat they used to be beef fat they were still good but lacked the savory depth of the beef fat ones the honey chive butter was still amazing she also ordered the puffed pork chips with sour cream and onion dip we d had these before too and they as delightful as we remembered the crispness and flavor of the chips yum the dip is pretty good but not my favorite she had the ricotta gnocchi which i think she liked i had the rabbit schnitzel scrumptious large basically like a pork schnitzel with a very slightly different texture the service was also good friendly and she mostly didn t forget about us even though we were sitting outside,this place makes great cakes most of them seem to be layer cakes in various flavor combinations though they do have other pastries all the cakes i ve tried have been very good i m less a fan of the ones that rely on buttercream frosting they look very pretty but it s just not my favorite style of frosting too dense i guess however for my birthday i had their boston cream creme cake which was absolutely delicious my boyfriend also got me a custom cake that s more european in style they did an amazing job and it says a lot that they were willing to try something new i don t believe they d made it before the shop itself is very cute definitely new fishtown but still manages to be charming the staff has always been friendly and willing to describe their goodies a tad on the expensive side there are certainly cheaper dessert options but this is a good way to spend money every once in a while
6195,we went with the simple choice and were not disappointed eggs bacon and buttermilk pancakes i can t put my finger on exactly what it was that made them so good but the pancakes were divine worth it in our opinion even saw a girl from the voice while dining here
6196,the mozzarella sticks and the fettuccini alfredo with shrimp are my fave here the pizza is actually delicious definitely a must have if in the st pete area the customer service is through the roof it s safe to say we are regulars here
6197,found this restaurant while i was in indiana for my work conference ate there 2 out of 3 days of visiting amazing food and service it was pretty busy for a wednesday and thursday night but the food was serve in a decent time the sashimi was super fresh that it melts like butter for sure will go back again if i ever pass by highly recommend for anyone that s new to town and looking for a sushi spot
6198,we had our pilot light go out on our water heater after accidentally turning off the gas valve and despite my best efforts could not get it to re light i called to set up an appointment and explained i knew it was the pilot light that was out i just needed help re lighting it the person who answered the phone was very helpful and accommodating with my schedule and put in a request for me to get the first appointment for the following morning our technician tom arrived perfectly on time i explained the user error to him and he was able to get our pilot light started in no time flat he also talked me through the lighting process so i will be better equipped next time it goes out i felt silly he had to come all the way out just to light our pilot but he was super cool about it overall quick and efficient service i will definitely use them again when i have any issues in the future
6199,a pho place that checks all the boxes but doesnt have the best of anything we went to lily s the day before so i guess this review is a compare and contrast decor is simple white wall with 7 frames of challenge winners and 2 laggy tvs the service is fine not as personal but nothing really to complain the food was the biggest difference between the places the pho was plain no complexity almost like it came from a dry seasoning pack they also recommended the chicken vermicelli as one of their best it wasn t first off they call it vermicelli but they used pho noodle instead what it was thick heavy and full the stomach quick everything a vermicelli not suppose to be anyway we left unsatisfied
6200,great food great prices and above all great customer service favorite was the al pastor strert taco added bonus was the salsa bar
6201,i stopped in henry s for coffee with friends on a sunday afternoon i didn t try any of their food but the coffee was good the atmosphere was nice and miraculously it wasn t packed on a rainy day one thing that seemed odd for a coffee shop the acoustics weren t great lots of echoes from kitchen other customers music etc throw down some rugs and this would be a nice spot to catch up over coffee or get some work done,i love livery it s one of my favorite spots in indy mostly because of their rooftop patio but their food is also awesome the food is mainly appetizers and small plates so it s not a place to go if you re starving but the atmosphere is lovely and the menu has some unique and more often than not delicious items that are fun to try it s a great spot for drinks and catching up as it s a little quieter and cozier than similar places in the area highly recommend
6202,over my 68 years i have eaten a lot of pralines some delicious some not so much but i can say with absolute certainty that they make the best praline i have ever had they aren t cheap but they are worth every penny i m just glad i live 70 miles away or i would go there all too often
6203,excellent food chicharrone s are off the chain staff is amazing especially bj must stop in when at armature works
6204,had breakfast here great service and the creme brulee french toast was amazing the portions were large when in nashville definitely stop by for breakfast
6205,this place is wonderful if you re looking for a great french inspired breakfast or brunch food this place is where it s at i love local places that aren t chains and it s even better when the food surpasses expectations the design is quaint and you even get a glimpse of the bakery where your food is prepared we ordered a croissant sandwich which was delicious and so fresh and not greasy at all banana bread french toast was bomb and no nuts was a bonus for someone with a nut allergy in fact unlike most french bakeries ingredients are listed on all to go bakery items which is a godsend the chorizo and goat cheese omelet was also delicious the owner was very kind and we can only hope he opens up another cafe in orlando
6206,have grabbed breakfast here a couple times and it s very good i wish they were open later especially on the weekends really enjoyed will be back
6207,i love this store awesome options for ready to go meals their take and bake pizzas are really good i love the atmosphere of this place only drawback it s a little pricey
6208,enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table a bit pricey but food was good go to side street in french quarter if u want quieter dining outside
6209,first time at a keke s and i will definitely be back soon we went during lunch time but i had my heart set on breakfast i went with the basic french toast and it was so yummy i asked for an extra side of powdered sugar but didnt actually need it because they aren t shy with their sprinkle kids meals were perfectly sized portions and my kids loved it i saw the glorious pancakes pass by and they re on my radar for next time my husband got a burger and fries which he was happy with one of the managers greg came by to check on us he wasn t happy with the quality of the french fries so he brought back a second set without even asking us and they tasted delicious our server was sweet food came out quick and correctly and the manager was great
6210,important note their hours have changed they now close at 3 00 pm this is my go to place for latin food i think the quality of the food is great they give you a good portion for the money and the people who work there are very friendly great place to go for lunch or supper
6211,here they come to save the day these guys are like superheros i locked myself out of my massage studio and within 20 minutes i was locking up and headed to pick up my son i chose alpine lock and key because they were close and had all 5 star reviews and for good reason the customer service lady was courteous and danny the locksmith was extremely fast and very nice i highly recommend that if you are locked out you call them thank you for saving my night
6212,come here for delicious home style new orleans cuisine we went in the afternoon and although it was full we were lucky and a table was ready right away we did the a la carte as opposed to the buffet it was our favorite meal of the trip
6213,excellent food excellent service shrimp and grits was by far the highlight bbq shrimp was messy but delicious
6214,just opened so staff not fully trained although it was busy and they lost my pizza it was surprisingly good will return when they get the kinks out a good addition and value to reno s marginal pizza offerings
6215,i have rated this 3 stars but if yelped allowed it i would probably rate it 3 5 stars came here on a random saturday at around 6pm there was no wait and we were seated right away however about 30 minutes later there was a slight wait seating was a little tight but that s probably due to the fact that it s a pretty small space they also have seating outside but it was pretty warm that day onto the food we ordered the coconut and cardamom infused soju the kfc wings fried rice the poke bowl can t remember the name the bibimbop and the matcha fruit tart i liked all the food it was freshly made however it didn t wow me the soju tasted more like cardamom than coconut but it was pretty strong the wings were good but i think i m one of those rare people who are not impressed with korean fried chicken wings don t hurt me i like buffalo wings my favorite part of the meal was the fried rice it had sausage kimchi and all that good umami flavor the poke bowl was just ok the flavor was good but it had very little fish and my dinner partner had the bibimbop which i did not try but he enjoyed it the matcha fruit tart was quite good and a nice detour from the usual fruit tarts i would definitely return but it s not a place that i crave
6216,in the dresses department awesome customer service i mean from everyone that i encounter i met a number of 4 ladies sale associates they all was wonderful nordstrom keep up the good work the wedding department is breathtaking
6217,reasonably priced spot with good beer and food selection i tried the po boy with saut onions and red peppers food was good and the fries were great note don t use ketchup as they are tasty by itself
6218,went here for lunch at the very end of the buffet they still had plenty of the things we love except bread at first we were disappointed then the waiter showed up with a plate full of fresh hot garlic naan we didn t even ask for it they were just thoughtful enough to serve customers hot bread have a piece of the cake for dessert they re light creamy and perfect for sharing half a slice cooled my palette tasted divine will go here again for sure
6219,very cute brunch spot avocado toast is filling and worth the hype loved every bite
6220,awesome vibe great wine and food the live jazz is great order the cheese and meat inside pay and they take it to the back fix it up and bring it out on a giant platter with extra goodies wine is pricey but well worth it great place to go with friends to kick it and chill
6221,never never ever would i stay at the blake hotel it s nasty bad customer service rooms are dirty we had a ant s all in our bed and chairs they promise to refund on day of parking which 44 07 which i haven t seen yet on my card yes parking is 40 00 a night plus taxes customer is horrible they have men bring in women off the streets not a safe area at all let s not forget the noise please don t waste your time and money sonya b my stay was june 15 though the june 17 and regret every day i was there
6222,cool beach vibe lot s of margarita choices items on their menu can be made gluten free which is a plus staff was very friendly food arrived quickly and was very good the live music was great
6223,amazing authentic classic italian melt in your mouth mussels with lots of garlic and parsley big fresh shrimp and homemade pasta cute place and great service fettuccine sauce was so good
6224,we are so fortunate to have the apa here for look after these animals in such need they do everything within their power to get every adoptable animal into loving homes i visit this shelter often and donate old towels and newspapers i have seen the staff caring for so many animals it s a beautiful thing to see these animals get adopted by excited new owners thank you apa for doing what you do for st louis pets in such need
6225,i have tried so many different nail salons in the st louis area i live in brentwood and there are many salons to choose from i have not been very impressed with most of them but i loved clayton nail spa i usually do not leave reviews but i had such a wonderful experience i wanted to share i made an appointment and got right in my nail technician was nikki she made my experience amazing she is not only incredibly talented and professional but she is so kind i got a mani pedi both look fantastic nikki spent time making sure both my pedicure and manicure were perfect even though they were very busy i will be back and i plan to bring my bridal party here in the fall for our wedding day nails save your time looking for a good salon and go to clayton nail spa ask for nikki
6226,only my 2nd time ordering but food is exceptional it s not your normal cheap quality chinese everything tastes and looks fresh everything has been very tasty and delivery is crazy fast only complaint is i wish they gave you a menu when you order i heard about the place from my neighbor i found the menu here on yelp but having an actual menu sometimes is convenient keep up the great work going to tell everyone about it
6227,not only is this the best thai food you will find in the growing metropolis of columbia but it s the best thai food you ll find in the entire stl area this is a restaurant worth crossing the river for you won t regret it whatever your favorite thai dish is they got it cooked to perfection warning the spice levels can vary depending upon the cook so if spicy foods aren t your thing tread lightly
6228,my first review ever i travel for business and honestly i get so sick of chains etc sometimes i just go to the grocery store and dethaw some shrimp cocktail in the room and some raw sugar snap peas i try many mom and pops but mostly get disappointed this one was not disappointing my wife is lithuanian so i have a lot of this food at home the cerna which are stuffed cabbages was on par with my wife s which is a complement at least on the night i went yes it was microwaved to heat it up unless you are lucky enough to get there when a batch comes fresh out of the oven we have to heat it up at home as well because you normally make big batches of it i had the cream of asparagus soup and it was the best version i have had anywhere the owner was nice the location and decor are mediocre but i have been to many great locations that have fabulous decor only to be sorely disappointed i thought the prices were extremely fair and to be honest really reasonable my dinner was 14 bucks come on now oh no alcohol however it looks as if you can bring your own
6229,stopped here for lunch after a group bike ride the outdoor patio is very nice with a mix of sun and shade the one waitress covering the patio seemed spread pretty thin i had boxcar burger which was on special it was flavorful but a little tough the ranch potatoes were really good
6230,ordered lunch for my coworkers last week we all had the chicken blt calling the order in was extremely easy they have a nice pickup counter and it was ready when i arrived the sandwiches were great and tasted fresh will definitely be back
6231,staying here every year while in new orleans beautiful scenery clean and safe they have a wonderful breakfast every morning staff is so kind and attentive this hotel has so much history wouldn t stay anywhere else
6232,such good food options for fast food at a mall the naan is fresh and the butter chicken is amazing
6233,we have eaten at stone creek on many occasions and have always been very happy with the service and food the early bird dinners on week nights are a great value and a good variety of options really love the atmosphere too would highly recommend
6234,i wasn t feeling the greatest and thought a juice might help i liked my limelight so much that i went back 4 days in a row juiced to order with lots of fresh fruit vegetables and ginger their soups are also good but call ahead to ask what kind they have it changes daily and i m picky enough that i don t care for all of them the chicken noodle is as good as my mom s just don t tell her carrot ginger is also a favorite i get my orders to go because the dining area is drafty and uninteresting
6235,locally owned shop for tires which are critical for cars wish they had more brand options in house but they can order you almost any tire you like local folks doing good work at decent prices
6236,super in every way just attended the blueberry festival had a special steak sandwich and blueberry tart home made chips excellent and service rarely seen thanks
6237,delicious indian food everything we ordered was so delicious and freshly made potato samosa the green sauce for appetizer and the meals were chicken biryani and 2 vegetarian dishes so glad we found this gem in philly we will be back here during our next visit for sure staff is super friendly too
6238,there was no wait when i went and was quickly seated tried the chicken marsala and liked that they replaced the traditional mashed potato with grits great food and nice atmosphere
6239,they have the best ceviche my husband loves their fish stew soup service has always been good for us and prices are reasonable fish is very fresh
6240,i ve seen some of the reviews where some customers were put off by the owner jay s personality once you get to know him you realize that he just sort of has a dry personality and he can be a little cynical in his approach but it really is not important he can t help it it s who he is he and his wife rita run a very reputable business with a gigantic selection of tiles and his prices are comparable i found some very unique tile for a couple of rooms in our house tile that no one else has service is quick and they know their stuff just try to ignore his quirky personality it s who he is but he really does run a fantastic business and has the best selection i ve ever seen they have been there for about 30 years or so
6241,i wanted to like this place a lot but it just didn t happen this time i am hoping that i can give them another try because i am a burger fanatic and would love to enjoy a good non mcdonald s burger every once in a while i came here around 9 30 pm and ordered a double trenton burger with ketchup mayonnaise pickles and raw onions along with fries and an oreo milkshake the milkshake was decently good there were too many fries and they were a tad on the dark side for me there needs to be a good fry to burger ratio in my opinion when ordering a burger and fries what am i gonna do with a whole bunch of fries after i m done my burger i wish they d charge less and give less fries on to the 9 burger it was okay but fell short in so many ways and that s ultimately why this place only gets 3 stars it seemed to lack seasoning as there was little taste to the burger the bottom bun had also gotten soggy and flat from the other ingredients and sort of fell apart in my hand as i was grasping the burger for whatever reason the pork roll didn t add much to the already unseasoned burger would ve maybe been better if there were two pork rolls on the double burger and if the beef patties were seasoned more thoroughly with at least salt and pepper i could not even taste salt at all i wanted to fall in love with the burger so badly but the lack of flavor each time i took a bite was just so disheartening i d like to give this place a try when i m having another cheat meal in a week or two i hope my next experience will be better and that this was just a one off
6242,corks n crowns is a great spot we used the tasting room for a private event and it could not have gone better nicole was wonderful to work with on our event she made the whole process very easy and made us feel that she genuinely cared about our experience and event we were able to do a tasting prior to the event so we could have a select menu our guests loved the location and atmosphere at corks n crowns the wines were amazing and the beer was a big hit there was plenty of variety we also had a food truck for our event and they were happy to correspond with them and figure out the logistics i would recommend stopping in for a glass of wine or reserving the entire place for a private event
6243,our favorite mac and cheese online tray ordering is easy and efficient pick up was quick and our guests enjoyed every last nite yum
6244,excellent food really cozy i ve been here twice so far and will definitely be back the sauce on the wings is really flavorful the peanut tai chicken was on point i was impressed with the sauce i ordered it because if you are going to put something like that on the menu in a small pub it has to be good and i was right the sandwiches are good the bloody marys are decent
6245,i have only lived here for about a year but han dynasty is my favorite restaurant in philly they have a 1 10 spice scale and in some dishes a 10 is actually very hot just how i like it the food is also delicious in general my favorites are the dan dan noodles a must the kung pao chicken nothing like what you get at your avg chinese restaurant and the spicy cucumbers i think i ve tried just about everything on the menu and it s all great portions are huge two people with big appetites can leave stuffed and with leftovers for less than 40 also all of the servers i ve had have been very nice and without mistakes despite how busy the place gets,came here for a school event i didn t get to pick the food but there were wings and they were pretty good drinks were strong
6246,i have been coming here for many years great operation and great people i have been to many places across the globe and this operation has the largest area to jet around in and have fun for the best fun go as early in the morning as you can just like water skiing when the water is like glass don t forget to bring your cell phone with you and take pictures great pictures and great screen savers to remember your fun
6247,if we had a choice of half stars this would be a 3 1 2 star review when we arrived we had to wait in line to be seated in spite of the fact we had pre purchased tickets they seated everyone at basically the same time no one really looked at my ticket either i could have probably flashed my epcor bill and gotten in that way too lol the venue was uncomfortably hot and stuffy it took a long time to get served and even longer for the drinks to arrive we had a few sips of our drinks and soon after they flashed the lights for last call sigh the comedians were funny and engaging we had lots of laughs and a pretty good time,i m always on the lookout for a good pizza place and since we were headed to the eskimos riders game it seemed like the perfect opportunity to check this place out when we arrived it was packed but thankfully we didn t have to wait at all the restaurant is quite large and there were a lot of saskatchewan roughrider fans myself included enjoying a meal before the game i ordered a coffee and we got a large 3 meat pizza unfortunately with it being so busy my coffee cup sat empty for awhile the pizza arrive in a reasonable amount of time fresh from the oven piping hot the pizza was very good no complaints i loved the chewy crust with the crispy cheese edge there were a decent amount of toppings tasty sauce and lots of cheese perfect our waitress was extremely busy but took the time to compliment my rider jersey and apologized for being so busy she was very sweet and was clearly busting her ass to trying to do a good job while we were waiting for our food i saw a lot of delicious food coming from the kitchen the steak shrimp looked delish we definitely plan on returning to try a few other items on the menu
6248,went there last night for dinner with another couple excellent place to eat service was great food was delicious i had the ny strip and it was perfect server overheard it was one of our birthdays recently and she brought out a candle on the dessert wine list is solid and the bar scene was really well thought out and nice 100 degrees out so i came in collar shirt and khaki shorts but i was a bit underdressed for the decor would recommend and go again
6249,not tremendously overwhelmed with dinner tonight have had the grill before and it was a better experience than tonight soup and salad were fine i had the american dream roll and he had beef negamaki the roll was bland with the exception of the spicy mayo the beef was extremely salty next time we will stick with the grill
6250,i called the restaurant and they were very apologetic and told me to go back for a meal on the house i did dining in today it was not bad at all i was very pleased so my lesson is to dine in instead of takeout
6251,went here easter of 2018 for the first time and had a blast i absolutely love it here and plan on returning before i move we went sunday evening and the place was definitely booming if you just want to order the tri tip sandwich which i highly recommend because it was delicious you won t need a reservation i believe they stop serving the tri tip around 5 but i could be wrong i made reservations for dinner in case my friends wanted something besides tri tip overall they enjoyed their dinner but i think they would have been happier with just the sandwich because it was on point we stayed to enjoy the atmosphere and live music this place didn t disappoint
6252,great spot delicious and fresh food i m looking forward to going back the drive thru is a great bonus for a mom like me on the go but looking for non fast food options super friendly and knowledgeable staff
6253,i love this gym i get the best workouts i used to get so bored and not want to workout at other gyms but fitness formulas classes are never the same so it keeps the element of surprise going plus i am very competitive and i have the heart rate monitor for meps so i can compete with people in the class and push myself harder i also like that a workout involves a little bit of everything cardio weights plyo tabata hitt you really never know and that has kept my body from plateauing love love love the staff everyone there is super nice and helpful all the time i believe everyone should give this gym a try then you will be as addicted as me
6254,this is my favorite spot to stop by after work to eat a small breakfast i find it very affordable and the atmosphere is so nice they have chairs outside to sit aside from breakfast meals coffee drinks drinks they have quite a variety in baked goods my friend loves their muffins it s definitely a place you should check out the staff are super friendly
6255,great addition to the mainline service and food were spot on great california wine selection too will be back
6256,had breakfast here on friday while visiting our daughter loved the option to get on waiting list using yelp the service was very nice and it felt like everyone genuinely wanted us to be happy i didn t get pictures darn but we all left happy and full looking forward to return at graduation
6257,really cool vibes the building itself is beautiful the food is authentic and good and i have come here every time i have visited this city it s our tradition now the staff is also very friendly
6258,best mexican food i have had in 10 years chile relleno is a must service was excellent the menu is extensive and has something for everyone food quality is exceptional went with three others who all agreed that this was a phenomenal experience
6259,blueprint does it again but this time with a twist on an old neighborhood spot formerly reliable brake service and now reliable break service welcome to lindenwood park neighborhood blueprint coffee delicious beans friendly staff walk up window outdoor patio space indoor seating all in a comfortable environment hang around or get it to go yummy,i decided to try wicke auto recently for state safety and emission inspections it was convenient for where i work and they were able to get me in i wasn t disappointed it s a nice big shop and a friendly man named gary will work with you the safety inspection yielded a need for a very small repair and they were able to order the part and have it repaired by the end of the day i dropped it off at 8 45am and picked it up by 4pm gary was kind patient and knowledgeable charges weren t the cheapest or the most expensive solid experience and i ll go back for a quote should i need service in the future
6260,the vehicle leasing experience can be annoying for a variety of reasons from the bad coffee to the smoke scented lounge to pushy sales pitches and the sketchy manager who claims the deal is so good he s not making any money off it thankfully north penn mazda is a group of true professionals who don t rely on these tactics for success the contemporary car leasing experience with truecar kbb edmunds etc empowers the purchaser to a previously unseen level i essentially called them with a quote gave them a competitors price and asked what they could do they didn t have the exact vehicle i wanted so delivered my vehicle within 24 hrs from another dealer they gave me a very competitive trade in price and streamlined the entire process if you are looking for a mazda or vw be sure to stop by
6261,amidst the slew of tours in this great haunting city we settled on the help of the great reviews of prior yelpers our guide was super enthusiastic which i believe is required for any good tour guides and was super knowledgeable about the tour in general it wasn t a super long tour but there were many great stories and a break in the middle where a bar was nearby for refreshments definitely enjoyable and do go and get one of their spots for readings it was incredible to say the least don t forget to tip the guide
6262,this place is one of my favorite new orleans hang outs whether it be a soccer game for my son a picnic or a walk along the mississippi the fly is a great place to go on beautiful day there use to be way more locals bbqing but since the early 2000s it has been taken over by college student in the weekend not such a big deal but you have to watch out for drunks who drive like they re on the highway especially with the soccer complex nearby
6263,i ve been back at least four times since my last review i just can t get enough of their menu the atmosphere and the price which i find reasonable for the quality of ingredients and the portion size the hummus is a must the pita is out of this world and on this most recent visit the show stealer was the sinnia chicken meatballs served in a creamy tahini sauce service can be hit or miss i sometimes find it a bit slow but otherwise a winning establishment i will recommend again and again
6264,the food here is amazing the pricing is very affordable everyone was very friendly they have welcoming people there everything was amazing
6265,we came here as a get together with our neighbors the back room was a perfect space but it was very loud and difficult to have a conversation seated at the long table the food was typical bar food but everything came out quickly
